Army Girl

Capt. Dike Conger and M/Sgt. "Three Star" Hennessy are sent with their new light tank for tests against horse cavalry under desert conditions. In an extended hell for leather race amongst a variety of obstacles, their tank wins against Col. Armstrong's 31st Cavalry.
During this period the Colonel's daughter Julie masquerades as a Southern Belle with no connection with the army to date Dike who vows to have nothing to do with Army Girls; the daughters of officers or soldiers. Enjoying each other's company Dike discovers that Julie is actually the Colonel's daughter but has fallen in love with her.
Due to the tank winning the competition, Army Headquarters orders that Captain Dike Conger take over the command of the 31st Cavalry from the kindly old Colonel Armstrong. Though Julie and the officers and troopers of the Regiment despise Dike for doing this, the gentlemanly Colonel Armstrong suggests a scheme to win his Regiment over; the Colonel and Dike swap mounts. However, in a wild ride inside the tank both the Colonel and "Three Star" are killed when the tank goes out of control.
Dike is court martialled but all discover an unsavoury truth.
