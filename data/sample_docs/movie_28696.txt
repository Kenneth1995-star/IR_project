Deool

Keshya is a village simpleton. One day, while sleeping under a tree after going in search of the village landlord's cow, he has hallucinations of Dutta (God) within the tree. He goes and tells a few people in the village including Vahini, the landlord's wife and Anna, an educated, city bred old man staying in the village. Some people rebuke him while some believe in what he says. The landlord, Bhau is disturbed by the developments. He is the unofficial head of the village though he has propped up a woman as the Sarpanch (village head). He has big political ambitions and is planning to build a hospital in the village under the guidance of Anna, which he can showcase of "development politics".
