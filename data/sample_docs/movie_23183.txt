Ninja Terminator

The members of a ninja empire are in possession of an object of power composed of three individual pieces of a ninja sculpture which, when combined, makes the owner's arms impervious to blades. Other ninjas feel the ninja empire is in need of reform and steal two of the three sculpture pieces. The ninja empire retaliates with threatening messages delivered via tiny robots which demand return of the powerful pieces. Ninja empire minions forge multiple attempts to attack the thieves but are quickly thwarted.
