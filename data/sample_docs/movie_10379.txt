The Holcroft Covenant

The story concerns Noel Holcroft's late father (a former associate of Adolf Hitler) who left behind a fortune, supposedly to make amends for his wrongdoings. Now, 40 years later, Noel finds himself embroiled in a web of conspiracies involving the children of two of his father's Nazi colleagues, a mysterious organization supposedly devoted to ensuring the Nazis never again come to power, and a woman who may be Noel's downfall, or his only hope.
