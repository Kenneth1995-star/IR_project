The film starts with the demise of CM (Satyamoorthy), a political plot produced by Boopathi (Prakash Raj), thereby starting the film on a serious note. Then, we are introduced to Kamalakannan (Karthi), who tells his story to the auto driver Rajini Appadurai (Santhanam). Appadurai assumes that Kamal is rich and drives him around the city to be profited for him.
Kamal is a country boy, who is working in a small company. He has come to the city to meet the concerned politicians and plead them to halt a subway project, by which he could lose his property in his village. He is the son of a humble person, who serves unlimited food to the guests and passers-by every day. Under this background, he has come to Chennai to settle the matter, as the forefather’s property is living heaven for the family.
Kamal stays in his aunt’s (Roja) house and love blossoms between Kamal and her daughter Sridevi (Pranitha Subhash). The love affair breaks up as it's not accepted by his aunt.
He meets the politician, Boopathi, who once visited their village during the election campaign and had promised to do good needs when required. But Kamal comes to know that he is the one behind the project. He later makes Ramani (Raadhika) as the mayor of Chennai by helping in her campaigns. He later, in a jail, gets the contact of Perumal (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who has an infamous political party. Meanwhile, he joins Perumal's party and makes him win the election making him the CM of Tamil Nadu. Boopathi is at last arrested for being the reason behind for Sathyamoorthy's suicide with his family. Kamal, at last saves his property with his intelligence and unites with Sridevi.
