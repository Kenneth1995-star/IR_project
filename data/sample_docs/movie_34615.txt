Hope

On her way to school, a young girl named So-won (which literally means "wish" or "hope" in Korean) gets sexually assaulted by a drunk older male stranger. As a result, she suffers multiple internal injuries and has to undergo a major surgery, but her emotional wounds are equally difficult to heal. Their happy family shattered, her parents Dong-hoon and Mi-hee go through feelings of pain and rage. From the trauma of that day, So-won refuses to see or talk to her father, so Dong-hoon hides beneath the costume of his daughter's favorite cartoon sausage character Kokomong and becomes her soft toy. Thanks to the love of those around her, So-won's condition gradually improves. Her father, dressed in the Kokomong costume, re-connects with his daughter finding hope in the midst of his sorrow and despair.
