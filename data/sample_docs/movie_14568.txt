The Terminal

Viktor Navorski, a traveler from the nation of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid. The United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation after the outbreak of a civil war, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now stateless. Because of this, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizes his passport and airline ticket.
With no other choice, Navorski settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a peanut can, much to the frustration of Frank Dixon, the temporary customs director for the airport. Dixon is being considered for a promotion and becomes obsessed with getting rid of Navorski. Meanwhile, Navorski befriends and helps airport employees and travelers. Among them, a flight attendant named Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo, presenting himself as a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Navorski had been hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
One day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions whether she knows Navorski's true situation. Amelia confronts Navorski at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the peanut can contains a copy of the photograph A Great Day in Harlem. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Navorski has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Navorski.
After nine months, Navorski friends wake him with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended. Amelia also asked her "friend"—actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair—to get Navorski a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn she has renewed her relationship with the man during this process. Moreover, Navorski finds out that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity, Dixon threatens to cause trouble for Navorski's friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta back to India, where he is wanted for attempted murder. Unwilling to let this happen, Navorski finally agrees to go home to Krakozhia. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane as it taxies to the terminal, resulting in his deportation, effectively taking the burden off Navorski.
The delay gives Navorski enough time to go into the city. Dixon, watching Navorski leave the airport, decides not to pursue him. Navorski arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home."
