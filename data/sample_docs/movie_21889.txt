Speaking Parts

Speaking Parts involves a struggling, bit-part actor Lance (Michael McManus), whose job as a hotel custodian is a front for his real job as a gigolo by his female supervisor (Patricia Collins). A female co-worker Lisa (Arsinée Khanjian) is obsessed with him, but he avoids her. Meanwhile, Lisa's obsession with Lance has led her to rent all video tapes of films in which Lance play as an extra, from Eddy's (Tony Nardi) video store. (He never plays any "speaking parts"). Lance notices a film script in a hotel room and decides to leave his acting resumé in the room, whose occupant turns out to be a screenwriter Clara (Gabrielle Rose) for a forthcoming television movie based on the true story of her deceased brother and herself. Clara recommends Lance to play the lead and the two begin an affair. She becomes increasingly distraught as it becomes evident that the movie's producer (David Hemblen) is changing the story which is very personal to Clara. As the film progresses towards the end, the inner worlds of Lance, Lisa and Clara and the tangle of relationships start to unravel
