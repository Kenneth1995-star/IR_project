High Life

Set in 1983, just after the birth of the Automated Teller Machine, High Life is a story of kinship, loyalty and honour amongst thieves. In a busy downtown hospital, a visit from his former sociopathic cellmate Bug (Stephen Eric McIntyre) has led to Dick (Timothy Olyphant) being fired from his job as a hospital janitor. Unemployed and in need of fast cash Dick gets the idea to rob one of the brand new ATMs, to "buy a little self-respect," announces Dick to Bug and the team. Enter the charismatic, criminally-minded Donnie, (Joe Anderson) and the front-man, the sexy, sleepy-eyed charmer Billy, (Rossif Sutherland) and all of the pieces are in place.[3] "It's a precision job," says Dick the night before the heist: "No violence."
Things do not go according to plan and the unfolding catalogue of disasters that confronts Dick is enough to test any friendâ€™s loyalties as they bungle their way toward a pipe-dream of quick riches. Alternately tragic and hysterical, High Life's perfect plan ends up anything but when one of the bank's employees double-crosses them all. Set against the nostalgic back-beat of Three Dog Night, Creedence Clearwater Revival and a raft of April Wine,[4] High Life's high-wire tension unfolds with calamitous results.
