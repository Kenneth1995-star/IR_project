Father Came Too!

Dexter (Stanley Baxter) and Juliet (Sally Smith) Munro are a married couple who move to a run-down cottage in hopes of escaping from Juliet's overbearing father, Sir Beverly Grant (James Robertson Justice). However, the couple is soon confronted by their new home's battered structure. Juliet's father offers help from a reputable building firm, but this help is refused by Dexter, who wants to remain independent of Juliet's father.
Dexter sees an ad in the local paper and employs Josh (Ronnie Barker) to do the work. The house is finished, but eventually burns down because of Juliet's father who changes the fuses from 15 amp to 30 amp, causing the fire. Roddy (Leslie Phillips) saves the day, telling Dexter and Juliet that the council is building a motorway on their land, so they can sell at a profit, and gives them the keys to a cottage requiring no work in the adjoining field.
