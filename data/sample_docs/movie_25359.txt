Jhoothi

Kalpana, a tomboyish character, lives with her mother, sister Alpana and brother Kamal, a police inspector. Kalpana is a compulsive liar but always for a good cause, landing herself and others often, in peculiar situations and misunderstandings too. While she sets up her brother with Seema and helps her sister Alpana come closer to Rasik, she herself falls for Dr Anil.[2]
