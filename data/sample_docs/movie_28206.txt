Palamattathu Varghese Mappila (Saikumar) is a wealthy Nasrani and a retired captain from the Indian Army. He is a widower and has four children, Christy (Mohanlal), Joji (Dileep), Jessy (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy) and Stella (Kanika). Varghese Mappila also has a property dispute with Kunnel Kumaran Thampy who kills Kochuthomma (Jagathy Sreekumar), brother of Vargheese Mappila.
Christy is a high-profile police informer who is working in Mumbai . His brother Joji goes to Italy to study theology, but later opts out of it after he falls in love with Meenakshi (Kavya Madhavan), daughter of the state home minister (Devan).
Christy is falsely arrested while rescuing his brother in law George Kutty. George Kutty later misleads Varghese Mappila & his family in believing that Christy is arrested due to his criminal activities and the relationship with Christy is broken. However the truth is that George Kutty is the one who is involved in sex racket and criminal activities. Meenakshi while returning to India is being kidnapped and the case is assigned to Christy since he is experienced in handling it. Christy finds that it is George Kutty who has kidnapped Meenakshi and rescues her. The next day the police finds that George Kutty is dead. Police arrest Christy for the crime through the assistance of IPS officer Joseph Vadakkan (Suresh Gopi) who is handling the case. Christy's friend (Sarath Kumar),known as Karim Lala alias Andrews,who was waiting to meet George Kutty (Andrews released Christy earlier when he jailed in Mumbai) assists him in escaping from the jail.
It is later revealed that Christy had not killed George Kutty but it was Joji who had done the crime. Joji learnt that George Kutty had killed his sister Jessy and forced her into prostitution. Joji could not tolerate and in a vengeance killed George Kutty. In the end Christy kills Kunnel Kumaran Thampy and his family.
