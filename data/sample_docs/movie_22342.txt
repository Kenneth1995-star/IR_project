Dirty Singles

Dirty Singles is a feature-length comedy-drama about a community of friends a few years after university. It’s about that time in your life when you’re in your first real job and your first real adult relationship—the one you think might just last forever. In this clique of friends, Jack-and-Megan, the perfect couple—perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect hair—turn out to be not so perfect. This revelation sends a shock through their little world, and soon the ‘break-up virus,’ and its after-effect, the ‘inappropriate hook up virus,’ make their way through the rest of the characters. But somewhere in this year of living ridiculously, playing grown-up must become being grown-up—and the same-old, same-old you thought would last forever proves to be as fleeting as the pop songs of three years ago. Dirty Singles is a naturalistic coming-of-age movie about twenty-somethings generally—and specifically it’s about young adults who happen to live in and around Parkdale in Toronto as they take their first faltering, glorious steps toward maturity.
