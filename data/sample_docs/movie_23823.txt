My Little Bossings

Torky (Vic Sotto) is a bookkeeper working for Baba (Kris Aquino) a millionaire cash management specialist. Because of some conflict in her business that puts her life in danger, Baba entrusts the safety of her son Justin (Bimby Yap) to Torky who takes him home to meet his daughter Ice (Aiza Seguerra) and Ching (Ryzza Mae Dizon) the street urchin that the latter took under her wing. Given that Justin is not particularly fond of Torky, how all four of them would get along under one roof becomes the focus of the story.
