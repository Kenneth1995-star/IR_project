The Coolangatta Gold

Joe Lucas is determined that his son Adam becomes a champion iron man. He neglects his younger son, Steve, who is an aspiring band manager and enjoys karate, as well as being his brother's training partner.
The leading iron man event is The Coolangatta Road, an arduous competition for $20,000 prize money. The favourite for this event is champion iron man Grant Kenny. Kenny's father beat Joe Lucas for the iron man title in 1960.
Steve falls in love with a ballet dancer, Kerri, who inspires him to compete with his brother in The Coolangatta Gold.
