Jyoti Bane Jwala

Suraj and Malti are in love and get very intimate. They are introduced to their respective families, and there is approval all round, and their marriage is to be finalized soon. Before that could happen, Suraj meets with an accident and is killed instantly, leaving Malti devastated. Malti's dad, Charandas, is shocked to find that Malti is pregnant, and both of them relocate to a secluded area, where Malti gives birth to a baby boy. Charandas has the child disposed of in a garbage can and tells Malti that the child died. Malti recovers and subsequently marries Mr. O.P. Bakshi and settles down. Years later, while watching a dance show with her husband, Malti sees a young man who resembles her dead lover in every shape and form. She attempts to make inquiries, but is afraid of what her husband will think when he finds out that the young man is her real son, born before getting married. The young man is Kishore, who was left in a garbage can at the time of his birth, but is now a dreaded, ruthless, and much feared criminal don, going by the name of Jwala Singh.
