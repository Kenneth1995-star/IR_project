Phantom of the Theatre

A haunted theatre, filled with the vengeful spirits of a tragically-trapped performance troupe murdered in a fire 13 years ago, waits for the once-grand palatial playhouse to re-open with a new show… and bring in new victims…[6] The Phantom of the Theatre depicts a tragic love story between hot film star Meng Sifan and young director Gu Weibang, the son of the warlord Gu Mingshan.[7]
