The Demi-Paradise

A Russian inventor by the name Ivan Kouznetsoff (Laurence Olivier) travels to England to introduce the British shipping industry to his newly invented and improved propeller blade. When he is in England Kouznetsoff meets the socialite woman Anne Tisdall (Penelope Dudley-Ward), and falls head over heels for her. Meeting Anne and hearing her views turn his own previous views and conceptions about the capitalist system and its degenerates up side down. After a lovers' quarrel, Ivan heads back to Russian only to be recalled to England a year later to smooth out imperfections in his design. Despite his efforts, his modifications prove to be unsound and he seems destined to return to the Soviet Union in disgrace.
The subject of affection, Anne, convinces the local shipbuilders to work around the clock in order to realize the revolutionary propeller. Soon they solve the problem, and there is a very successful launch of the new line of propelled ships. Ivan can return to the Soviet Union to aid the war effort, enriched by Anne's love.[2]
