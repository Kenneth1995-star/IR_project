The Snorkel

After Paul Decker (Peter van Eyck) seals windows and doors in a stylish European sitting room, he attaches rubber hoses to a snorkel. He lets gas escape through the room's lighting fixtures, allowing the gas to kill his dead wife, Madge, who is lying prone on the couch while he hides under the floorboards, using the snorkel to breathe while concealed. Decker remains under the floor as household servants discover Madge's body. Since the room has been locked and sealed from the inside, it appears to the local Italian police and British Consulate Mr. Wilson (William Franklyn) to be a suicide.
Madge's teenaged daughter Candy (Mandy Miller) has been traveling, and she with her dog Toto and traveling companion Jean Edwards (Betta St. John). Candy vocally accuses Paul (her stepfather) of the murder, but he has an alibi: at the time of the murder, he was just across the border in France, seeking peace and quiet at a lodging to work on a book he is writing. Candy is adamant; she is also convinced that Paul killed her father in a boating incident several years before. When Paul can produce a passport proving that he had passed into France, Candy is all the more determined to discover how her stepfather could commit the murder.
