Zombadings 1: Patayin sa Shokot si Remington

When Remington was young, he saw an old gay (Roderick Paulate), unknown to be a witch. He mocked and called the gay man ugly. The gay man cursed him to be a gay on his 21st birthday, leaving him at shock.
Many years later, he returned to his hometown for a vacation when news about mysterious murders of several known gays in the town emerged. He investigated the area and asked a woman, revealed to be the gay woman's niece where he went. He was shocked to learn that the gay died many years ago.
When the time where the curse will take effect, his attitude towards his friends changed to being gay. His habits changed like putting make-up and walking with woman's clothes, although he tried to control himself. As time runs out, the dead gays rose to their graves and haunts the town, killing and hurting anyone who stands in their way. He must find the gay man's twin brother.
And the clock strikes 12 midnight, the curse takes effect, but his father's sacrifice saved him.
Many days later, he leaves the town to continue his study. His father turned gay and saw a guy washing his body on the rain. He woos his wife to watch.
Before the film ends, as the tricycle Remington speeds by, another tricycle appears, unloading another old gay. A kid saw him, but instead of insulting him, the kid praised him.
