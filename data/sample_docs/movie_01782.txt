She Had to Choose

Sally Bates (Isabel Jewell) leaves Texas, headed for Hollywood, in the 30’s. She is tempted to take a job as a mechanic, with Pop (Arthur Stone), on the highway; but, presses on in to town.
She’s going to sleep in her old “Tin Lizzie”. But, after she saves Bill’s neck (Buster Crabbe), with her old six-shooter, during a botched hold-up. Bill (Buster Crabbe), takes her home, to live with his Mom, (Maidel Turner); and gives her a job at his drive-in restaurant.
Sally’s friendly and easy going manner is very popular, with the customers; but, Bill gets jealous when Jack (Regis Toomey), the reckless, younger brother of his well-to-do girlfriend Clara (Sally Blane), starts paying Sally attention, following her around in his roadster.
Sally is so humiliated, when Clara rips off the dress Jack gave her, at a nightclub, she ends up at his hotel room, married to Jack, after an ill-conceived night of drinking.
Bill arrives, in the morning, to confront the drunken Jack, and take Sally home; but, when Jack is so drunk, he trips, and smashes his head, killing himself; Bill is under investigation for murder of the wealthy socialite.
