Nandeeswarudu

Nandu (Nandamuri Taraka Ratna) is a student who wants to become a police officer. His parents (Suman and Seetha) want him to lead a meaningful life. Nandu has a habit of getting into fights and this leads him to clash with a local gangster Baba (Ajay). A few shocking incidents take place and Nandu ends up in jail. Fed up with the way things are turning up, Nandu introspects and decides to redeem himself as a man of the people. He reshapes himself as Nandeeswarudu and starts fighting for people who are oppressed.
The government appoints Commissioner Eeswar Prasad (Jagapathi Babu) as a special officer to rid the city of gangsters. In the fight between Nandeeswarudu and Baba, only one emerges victorious. Who will it be? That forms the story.[3]
