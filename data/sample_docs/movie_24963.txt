Warrant

During a jail riot instigated by jailed convict Jaggu (Joginder), the Jailer, Arun Mehra's (Dev Anand) life is threatened, and another convict Dinesh (Satish Kaul), risks his life to save Arun. Arun and his mom, Mrs. Mehra (Sulochana) find out that Dinesh is on death-row for killing noted Professor Ashok Verma. Arun does not believe that Dinesh is guilty, and so he arranges his escape and as a result he has not only the police, including his very own dad, Inspector General of Police Mehra (Pran) after him on a manhunt, but also underworld don Master (Ajit Khan) and his men; and a cold-hearted female assassin (Zeenat Aman) who has reserved just two bullets in her gun for Arun and Dinesh. All songs, which are popular even today, are penned by Anand Bakshi.
