Chor Police

Inspector Sunil Rana (Shatrughan Sinha) has been assigned the case of triple-homicide of the Sinha family, namely Mr. Sinha (Ashok Kumar); his son Inspector Rohan (Vinod Mehra), and Rohan's wife (Bindiya Goswami). After an investigation, Sunil concludes that the assailant can only be Dr. Singh (Kader Khan), who escapes from India, and re-locates to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, far from the jurisdiction of Bombay Police. Sunil must overcome borders to apprehend Dr. Singh, and thus bring justice to the Sinha family. It is then Sunil comes to know that Dr. Singh is not the only one involved in this homicide, which is far more complicated that he had thought it to be.
