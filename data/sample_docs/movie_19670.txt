Death Drums Along the River

In an unnamed small British colony on the west coast of Africa, somewhat resembling The Gambia, two policemen patrolling a wharf sight a sack of peanuts dropped by stevedores. As the sack breaks the workers discover a pouch in it that is quickly grabbed by a man who then runs away. The policemen chase him and he eventually kills one of them before disappearing. Police Commissioner Sanders (Todd) questions Pearson (Bill Brewer), a suspected criminal, but finds no information.
At the same time, a Dr. Jung (Koch) arrives at the airport and is met by Todd's assistant, Inspector Hamilton (Jeremy Lloyd). Dr. Jung is going to a German-run clinic up country, close to the colony's eastern border. Also on the plane with her is an American journalist (Robert Arden) who wishes to visit the clinic to do a story, and also turns out to be an old friend of Pearson.
Commissioner Sanders begins to suspect the clinic as a location for smuggled diamonds from across the border.
