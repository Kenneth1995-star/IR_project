Welcome Home

Elmdale's chamber of commerce is all but broke. A decision is made to spend what remains of the budget on a reunion that hopefully will entice one of America's wealthiest men, Andrew Anstruther, to return to the place of his birth and build a new factory there.
Con men get wind of it. Dickie Foster, a gambler, is one. He and his partners, a fake bond salesman, Giltedge, and a gold-tooth-stealing dentist called Painless, have already taken the town for $10,000 in bogus bonds. "Gorgeous," his girlfriend, believes in Dickie, but when he goes to Elmdale, he becomes smitten with local girl Susan Adams.
Anstruther takes a liking to Dickie, but Giltedge bilks the millionaire out of $36,000 for worthless bonds. Dickie bets on a horse for Susan's sake to win the money back, but the horse loses. The crooks are charged with murder after Anstruther vanishes, but he turns up just in time to vouch for Dickie as a friend. After he learns Susan has a boyfriend, Dickie goes back to the arms of Gorgeous, who tells him, "Welcome home."
