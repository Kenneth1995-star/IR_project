Jungle Man

Bruce Kellogg and his friend Alex are off to Africa on an expedition to the "City of the Dead" that is actually footage of Angkor Wat. Bruce's fiancee Betty and her father decide to go along to visit her father's brother James who is a missionary in the same part of Africa. Arriving at the Rev Graham's home they meet Dr Hammond who has spent five years developing a serum to a deadly fever that rages in the area. The results of his work are placed on a freighter to America that has been sunk by a submarine.
As Alex and Bruce venture to the lost city, an epidemic of the fever rages in the territory.
