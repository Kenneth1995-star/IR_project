Seenu (Santhanam) is a happy go lucky guy and his parents search for a bride to get him married within three months as per an astrologer’s advice. But Seenu does not believe in arranged marriages and tries to woo girls around him. Eventually Seenu falls in love with Maha (Ashna Zaveri) for which she does not reciprocate. Meanwhile Seenu’s wedding is fixed with Akhila (Akhila Kishore) by his parents.
Now Seenu finds out that Maha also loves him and decides to cancel his wedding with Akhila with the help of his maternal uncle Ulaganathan (Thambi Ramiah) but all go in vain. One day, Seenu calls Akhila to inform her about his love for Maha. But coincidentally it was Akhila’s birthday and he prefers not to disappoint her on her birthday.
Maha spots Seenu with Akhila and understands the truth. Maha also informs this to Akhila. Maha is angered and breaks up with Seenu. But Akhila forgives Seenu and prefers the wedding to proceed as planned. On the day of wedding, Seenu gets a call from Maha asking him to marry her in a register office else she would commit suicide. Seenu rushes to the register office to save Maha but gets shocked seeing Maha’s wedding with her cousin. Seenu understands that it was a prank played by Maha to revenge Seenu.
Seenu rushes back to his wedding hall, but Akhila got married to her family friend as everyone believed that Seenu eloped with Maha. Seenu’s parents worry thinking about his situation but Ulaganathan proposes Seenu’s wedding with his daughter (Vidyulekha). In the end, Seenu is married to Vidyulekha.
