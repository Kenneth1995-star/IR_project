Home Is Where the Hart Is

A cunning nurse and con artist Belle Haimes (Valri Bromfield) lives with her simpleton of a husband Rex Haimes (Stephen E. Miller) in the Hart Mansion in British Columbia. There she takes care of the invalid, 103-year-old Slim Hart, called "Pappy", (Joe Austin) and his wife, Minnie (Enid Saunders) who has been in a coma for some time. Waking up one day, nurse Belle doesn't feel very prone to go back to her dead end job nursing the old couple. She accidentally overhears the night nurse working at the same mansion (Leslie Jones) reading a postcard from the old couple's two twin boys, Martin Hart (Eric Christmas) and Art Hart (Ted Stidder). The postcard tells that the boys will be returning home to their Pappy soon. With that information in mind, Belle starts planning the demise of the old comatosed Mrs. Hart and the kidnapping of Old Pappy but things don't go quite according to plan.[1]
