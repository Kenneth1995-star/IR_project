Inuyasha the Movie: Fire on the Mystic Island

In Horai Island, six half-demon children (Asagi, Dai, Roku, Moegi, Shion and Ai), watch a woman (resembling Kikyō) dropping a green orb to the Cauldron of Resonance. It frees the Four War Gods (Ryūra, Jūra, Kyōra and Gōra), and the scars appear on the rest of all children. Ai, not affected by the gods, leaves the island to meet up with Inuyasha and his friends. The heroes learn that Gōra used Kikyo's blood to create her doppelganger and Ryūra placed the scar on Inuyasha, though Inuyasha and the children cannot resist it. One man tells the story about the myth of the island, before Kikyō sets out to aid Inuyasha. As the rest of the villagers safely head to the shrine, Sesshomaru remembers the day he got the scar. Upon arriving at the island, Inuyasha and his friends are ambushed by Jūra. While Miroku and Sango manage to distract Jūra, Inuyasha saves Kagome and Ai from Ryūra. After the heroes meet the rest of the children, they head to the cauldron. When Inuyasha and Asagi end up in the dimension of the cauldron, they learn that the priestess Kanade died sealing the gods fifty years ago. Before Inuyasha and Asagi leave the cauldron, they obtain the sealed box. When the doppelganger steals it, she breaks it to release the power spheres and strengthen the gods. The heroes plan to abandon the island. Sesshomaru kills Kyōra and destroys the cauldron, Miroku and Sango defeat Jūra, and Kikyō kills the doppelganger to save Inuyasha. After Inuyasha defeats Ryūra and Gōra, the four spheres combine to create the final War God. After the spiritual fireflies lead the children to Kikyo's bow, Kagome uses it. With the blessing of the fireflies, Inuyasha and Kagome combine their attacks to defeat the god. With the island gone, Inuyasha, Sesshomaru and the children are freed from the curse.
