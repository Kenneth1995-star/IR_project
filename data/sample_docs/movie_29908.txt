In the past, Victor was a smart student, he lived in an orphanage owned by the kind-hearted church priest Adaikalam (Charuhasan). The orphanage struggled to raise funds, so Victor worked part-time as an auto rickshaw driver to help financially the orphanage. One day, Victor found a briefcase full of money in his auto rickshaw forgotten by a passenger. Victor later returned the money to that passenger Devanesan (Sreekanth) who was a rich industrialist. Impressed by Victor's sincerity, Devanesan promised to give 10 lakhs rupees to the orphanage. In the meantime, Victor and Indhu (Subisha) fell in love with each other. Thereafter, Devanesan died suddenly and his personal assistant Viswanath (Uday Prakash) refused to give the money promised for the orphanage.

Vinoth gives a small fund for the orphanage, he then threatens Viswanath to give back the money but Viswanath continues to refuse and he decides to kill everyone who stands in his way. Viswanath and his henchmen kill Devanesan's faithful servant Daas, the priest Adaikalam and Vinoth's wife. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
