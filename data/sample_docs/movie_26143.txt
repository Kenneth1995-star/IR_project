Maa Tujhhe Salaam is the story of an Indian military officer, Major Pratap Singh (Sunny Deol), who aborted a terrorist infiltration attempt of the enemy country single-handedly with the help of a few local civilians, at an area that's located near the border of India.
Zhonabad is the name of the area that is located at the high-altitude mountain ravines. In this area lives a man called Lala (Tinu Verma). Since his ancestors were landlords before independence, Lala is a much respected and influential man there. But behind the curtain, he is a Pakistani agent who helps infiltration of terrorists and ammunition through the passes in mountains known to him and his men only. In the winter season, the weather conditions become unfit for inhabitants of the area, who are forced to shift to other places from there. Lala takes advantage of this situation and carries out his activities.

The military authorities order Major Pratap to go to Zhonabad to keep an eye on Lala and Albaksh. In the meanwhile, Albaksh comes to know of Lala's activities. He opposes Lala, but invites his wrath in turn. Lala frames and portrays Alabksh as a traitor and terrorist in the eyes of law. The police arrest Albaksh.
Subsequently, Major Pratap meets Albaksh, who reveals Lala's activities and also how he is all set to help the infiltrators into the country through Zhonabad. Since there isn't much time for the Indian military force to reach Zhonabad, Major Pratap decides to fight the battle alone with the help of Albaksh and the local people.
