Bad Seeds (Les Mauvaises herbes)

The movie actually begins as the story of Jacques (Alexis Martin), a struggling actor who is being harassed by the mob because of gambling debts. Jacques flees the city and lands in a rural outpost at the home of a reclusive farmer, Simon (Gilles Renaud). Simon has his own debts to a gang of local criminals, but the marijuana he’s raising far from the snooping eyes of authorities could solve his problems, and Jacques sees a way out of his difficulties if he can team up with Simon. They acquire a third partner when a young utility inspector, Francesca (Emmanuelle Lussier-Martinez), comes to investigate why Simon’s electricity bill is so high. The two men capture her, but she convinces them that she has something to add to their enterprise, and in fact, she proves to be a pretty tough negotiator as she takes charge of the two men’s operation.[7]
