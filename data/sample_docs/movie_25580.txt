Tejaa

Lal Singh, Heeralal Ghosh, and Zoravar rob the gold vault of a bank, take off with all the gold bars they can carry, and bury it deep in the countryside. Several weeks later, they return to share the bars between them but find them gone. Suspecting a nearby family of having stolen them, they kill the husband; wife, Shanti; hang the young son, and abscond upon hearing people coming to investigate this commotion. Twenty years later, a man named Tejaa meets with Lal Singh, and kills him. Then Tejaa meets with Heeralal, befriends him, and then subsequently kills him. When Zoravar finds out that he could be Tejaa's next victim, he starts to take all possible precautions from this assailant, as well as lay an elaborate trap and ensure that they avenge their former partners and father respectively.
