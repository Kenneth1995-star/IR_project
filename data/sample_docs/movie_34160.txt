Before leaving for a permanent residence in Germany, famous opera singer Lyuba (Kseniya Rappoport) brings her son Andryusha (Roman Shmakov) to the Russian heartland to say goodbye to her native home. For her these places represent beautiful romanticism of Russian poetry. The son goes to see the exposition of the local kremlin and disappears. Lyuba first looks for her son, and then remains in the city and waits for her son to return. Gradually she becomes a different person. Opera singer Lyubov loses her son, voice, destiny and transforms into a coarse cleaner Lucy. And in this new person additional qualities appear.
