Smart City

A 10-year-old orphan raises his hand against a police officer who commits an act of injustice. Impressed, Sekharan (Murali), the godfather-like gang leader who cares for the poor, gives him shelter. The boy grows up to be Sekharan's most trusted associate, Madhavan (Suresh Gopi). Sekharan's daughter Sarada (Lakshmi Gopalaswami) is married to Sarath Chandran (Manoj K. Jayan), a town planning officer. A real-estate group, Kottooran Group, in collusion with finance minister Reghuram (Shammi Thilakan), wants to forcibly evict over 6,000 families from the land for a Smart-City-type industrial project. Sekharan is able to foil the plans of the Kottoorans with the help of the Chief Minister (Rajan P. Dev). Thus begins the feud between the Kottoorans and Sekharan. The real brain behind the Kottoorans and the people who remained in the background now comes out into the open.[1]
