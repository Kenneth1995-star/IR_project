Oru Thalai Ragam

Oru Thalai Raagam is the heart breaking love story of Subhadra and Raja, played by (Roopa) and (Shankar) respectively. They are classmates and their colleagues/classmates include Ravindran, Chandrasekhar, Kailash, Thyagu and others. The day starts for them at the Railway Station, where they all catch the train to the college. Raja sincerely loves Subhadra, but she does not reciprocate as she is an introvert as well as she is afraid of society's backlash. Moreover her mother's character isn't spoken good by the same people. Even though Subhadra loves Raja, she always tries to insult him whenever opportunity comes, but on the positive side, she sometimes shows her feelings for him as well.
Raja's life becomes hell as he couldn't concentrate on his studies and he is not taking care of his health as well as he gets affected by liver jaundice. Raja cuts a sorry figure among his colleagues and all of them want Subhadra to accept Raja's love. Later Raja's health deteriorates as he still neglects to have proper food and rest. Finally, college days are over for the batch and Subhadra decides to proclaim her love. She gets in the train and see Raja sitting in the compartment and she happily starts speaking with him saying to accept his love and seek apology for her indifferent behavior, but it was too late as Raja dies during her proclamation.
