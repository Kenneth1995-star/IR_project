The Prisoner

In an unnamed East European country that has recently come under Communist tyranny in place of Nazi tyranny, a Cardinal (Alec Guinness) is falsely accused of treason. The Interrogator (Jack Hawkins), an old friend of the Cardinal's but now a Communist, is given the task of persuading him to make a public confession of treason.
The Interrogator eventually breaks though by showing how the Cardinal became a priest to escape from his childhood. To purge his sin, in the show trial the Cardinal confesses to every lie of which he is accused, and is released to face a silent, bewildered crowd.
There is a subplot about a young warder (Ronald Lewis) who is in love with a married woman (Jeannette Sterke), who wants to leave the country and join her husband.[2]
