Ravi Yadav (Vinod Khanna) is the servant of Manohar Singh (Rajiv Verma). He has a younger brother, Rohan Yadav (Salman Khan), whom he wishes to see as a successful and good lawyer. Manohar's wife starts to teach Ravi English so he can get a good job when he goes to Mumbai and that he can afford Rohan's school and college expenses, but Manohar feels insecure and plans to jail Ravi. Ravi is falsely accused of raping his lover, Parvati, and sentenced to 12 years in prison because the real rapist killed Parvati and then told the court that Ravi has raped her. Manohar's wife Renuka (Moushumi Chatterjee) assures Ravi that she will help Rohan in becoming a lawyer.

When he enters Vasudev's room he sees a picture and gets to know that Vasu is Rohan. He returns, but Vasu catches him and starts beating him, and Ravi is arrested. In the police station, Renuka comes rushing because her memory has returned. Everyone gets to know about what happened and Payal is reunited with her mother, whom she was told had died.
