Mangalya Balam

Zamindar Papa Rao (S. V. Ranga Rao) lives in town with his wife Kantham (Suryakantam), mother Parvathamma (Kannamba) and two children Suryam & Saroja. Kantham is an aggressive woman who, always illtreats her mother-in-law. Papa Rao has a sister named, Sita (G. Varalakshmi) who has married a poor man named, Rangaiah (A. V. Subba Rao) and they live in the village of which Papa Rao is the Zamindar. Sita eventually suffers a serious illness and is nearing her last days. This prompts Parvathamma to reach their village along with Suryam & Saroja.
To fulfil Sita’s last wish Parvathamma performs her eight-year-old Saroja’s (Baby Sasikala/ Savitri) marriage with Sita’s ten-year-old son Chandram (Master Babji/Akkineni Nageswara Rao) in the absence of Papa Rao & Kantham.
On coming to know about what has transpired, Papa Rao & Kantham take away their son & daughter to the town in an effort to destroy the relation
An infuriated Kantham even removes the wedding chain (Mangalsutra) from Saroja’s neck.
The children grew up in different places and meet at a hill station, fall in love not knowing they were cousins and wedded during their childhood. But Parvathamma reveals to Chandram about his childhood marriage. Saroja’s brother Suryam (Ramana Murthy) also tells his sister that she was already married to her cousin and gives her the wedding chain, Mangalsutra that their mother threw away. Unaware that Sekhar whom she loved and Chandram are one and the same, Saroja keeps a distance from him. Meanwhile, her marriage is fixed with distant relative Kailasam (Relangi) who is in love with Meenakshi (Rajasulochana). To reunite with Saroja, Chandram along with Kailasam enacts a drama and brings the story to a happy ending.
