Partners of the Plains

Lorna Drake (Gwen Gaze), is an aristocratic British girl and Hoppy's (William Boyd) new employer. When Cassidy refuses to be ordered, Lorna has him arrested for horse stealing. The dumbfounded sheriff (Earle Hodgins) is even more puzzled when Miss Drake turns right around and demands that Hoppy be released into her custody.[3]
