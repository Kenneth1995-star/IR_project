Late Bloomers

A couple, Adam (William Hurt) and Mary (Isabella Rossellini), are both heading into their sixties, but react to this differently. A retired teacher, Mary begins to make adjustments to their home to make it more practical for their age. Adam is defensive to any changes and fiercely defends his progression as an architect. They live in London, next door to Mary's mother, Nora who raised her daughter in Italy. Mary worries about an incident of memory loss and her doctor prescribes her to keep active. Adam, insulted by an offer to design a retirement home, instead turns his attention to the proposal of a young associate, Maya (Arta Dobroshi) to participate in a competition to design a new museum. Adam becomes nocturnal, working on the project over-night with young associates. Mary becomes used to an increasingly empty home, but attracts an admirer at the gym.[1]
