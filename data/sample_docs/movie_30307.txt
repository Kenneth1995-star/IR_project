Ethirum Pudhirum

Kannan (Mammootty) is a sincere district collector. A female leader of a major political party is kidnapped by terrorist Veeraiyan (Nassar), and he promises to return her back if his injured brother Arasappan (Napoleon) is treated well and brought back safely. The government agrees to this condition and asks Kannan to look after Arasappan. At first, Arasappan hates Kannan and his family as Kannan works for the government against whom his brother's group is rebelling, but the kindness shown by Kannan's wife and mother change his attitude. Just when he was about to turn over a new leaf, a bad thing occurs. The police team, without taking the necessary orders from Kannan, go to the forest and attack Veeraiyan's gathering. This angers Arasappan, but he was restrained by Kannan. Now, the police accuse Kannan of having links with the terrorists as Arasappan ran away from his house and Kannan condemned the police action; hence, they arrest Kannan's wife and mother. (Kannan ran away to find Arasappan) Hearing this sad news, Arasappan himself surrenders to the police as he did not want them to suffer for him, but the police do not spare him despite his surrender.
