Dr. Madhurika a.k.a. Modern Wife

Dr. Madhurika (Sabita Devi) is a "modern" young woman, committed to her career and believes in family planning. She marries Narendra (Motilal), but first makes him agree to not wanting children as a way of controlling population growth. She would also prefer that he not interfere in her work or stop her from meeting friends. She becomes friendly with one of her doctor colleagues, Dr Gaurish (Pesi Patel), but when she sees Narendra paying attention to Gaurish's wife her jealousy is aroused. She then turns into a typical housewife of whom her husband can be proud.
