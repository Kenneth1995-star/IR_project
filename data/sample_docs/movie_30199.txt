Kalki

Chellammaa (Geetha), a singer, is wedded to a chauvinistic, sadistic industrialist named Prakash (Prakash Raj). She is unable to beget a child and hence is the target of hurting words from Prakash and his mother. When he prohibits her from singing, it is the last straw for her and they divorce. He marries Karpagam (Renuka), a doormat wife, while Chellammaa stays single, with a cook Kokila (newsreader Fathima Babu in her first movie appearance) around to help her. Kalki (Shruti) works in an ad agency and is relentlessly pursued by co-worker and model Paranjothi (Rahman) but she not only rejects him but debunks love and sentiments. Chellammaa becomes friends with Kalki after a few encounters and Kalki moves in as a paying guest. But she strikes up a friendship with Prakash and as the result of an affair with him, she ends up bearing his child. Kalki makes him understand what he was doing to his wife by treating him like the way he treats his wife. During the time of delivery, Karpagam with her lawyer threatens Prakash that she is going to divorce him. But realizing the mistakes he did, Prakash asks sorry to Karpagam and asks for a chance to change himself. She agrees with a condition not to hurt Kalki's child and also to live with Kalki. He agrees to both the conditions. When they meet Kalki and inform this, Kalki says she doesnâ€²t want to live with them as well as not ready to give the child to them. Before delivery she meets Chellamma and informs that she did live with Prakash to teach him a lesson and had a child just for Chellamma and leaves the child with Chellamma after delivery. After that the society is not ready to accept her so he goes to Paranjothi who is waiting for her and confesses her love for him.
