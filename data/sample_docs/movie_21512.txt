Altar

The Hamilton family move into a large country house on the Yorkshire Moors to supervise its restoration from a dilapidated B&B to the original Victorian grandeur. When Meg Hamilton, wife, mother and renovation expert loses first her London renovation team after an accident, then a local Yorkshire team too superstitious to continue, she’s forced to carry on alone. The discovery of a secret attic room, a Rosicrucian mosaic, a bricked up root cellar and many other unexplainable events gradually convince Meg, her husband Alec and children Penny and Harper, that they’re not only restoring the house, but also its original Victorian owners who died 150 years ago. But before they can escape, the house—and its former occupants—force them to spend one last, terrifying night under its roof.[2]
