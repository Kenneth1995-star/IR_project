Meenda Sorgam

Nirmala (Padmini) is a poor but talented young dancer who falls in love with a rich man's son Sekar (Gemini Ganesan), but he is forced to marry a rich man's daughter Prathiba (Tambaram Lalitha). Nirmala promises to her lover that she will never dance in public. Due to various circumstances, Sekar's house is up for auction, and in order to save him, she performs in public. With the money thus earned, she saves his house, but Sekar is unaware of this. When he learns the truth, he begins searching of her, and in the meantime, Prathiba, who is now reformed, commits suicide. Sekar meets Nirmala, who is on the verge of committing suicide, and they are reunited.[3]
