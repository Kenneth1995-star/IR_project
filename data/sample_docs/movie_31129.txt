Professor Neelakantan (J. Livingston) is an maverick Indian scientist and inventor who develops and constructs a time machine, and begins experimenting with it. He realises that his machine requires a recognised "object" to work, and he therefore seeks to locate such an object that can be transported in time through his machine. He jokingly tells his pet dog that he would use it as the "object".
Varsha (Sreelakhsmy N. Nair) and Vikas (Prithvi) are Neelakantan's mischievous granddaughter and grandson who live with their parents and are very fond of the grandfather. While on a visit, the two children enter Neelakantan's laboratory in his absence and start playing with the dog. Varsha throws a ball that strikes the time machine's control screen and accidentally turns on the device, which recognises Varsha and Vikas as transferable "objects". Neelakantan enters the room and is shocked to see the machine's condition, but it is too late. As he tries to save the kids, he too is recognised as an "object" by the machine, and his grandchildren and he are accidentally transported to the age of dinosaurs.
In the prehistoric world Neelakantan and his grandchildren encounter animals that are now extinct, including several species of dangerous dinosaurs. At first they are afraid and struggle to understand what to do. But, gradually they try to be friends with a dinosaurs. They wish to return to the modern times, but for that they would require a source of electricity, which does not exist in the prehistoric times they have been transported to. How they survive their circumstances and finally manage to return to their own age is the main plot of the film.
