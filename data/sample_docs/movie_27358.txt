Rocky

Rocky (Yash) is a young college student raised in an unloving home. Usha (Desai) comes from a loving home but lost her mother in death. They meet on her first day of college and it is love at first sight for Rocky. Usha agrees to be friends and Rocky hides his feelings for her. One day he is dismayed to find that Usha has an overwhelming fan crush on a classical guitarist named Vishwas (Aryan). In order to demonstrate that Vishwas does not care for Usha, Rocky tries to arrange for them to meet. Vishwas makes this difficult for Rocky because he believes that he is being sent by the enemies of his don brother (Raju) to harass him. Finally Rocky sees them together and is happy with his work until he realizes that Vishwas is starting to believe that he is in love with Usha. The competition between the two increases until Usha herself realizes that she herself is actually in love with one of them.
