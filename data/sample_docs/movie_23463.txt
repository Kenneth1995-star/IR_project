Fist Power

Brian Cheuk is a mainland Chinese security specialist and martial arts teacher. He visits his family in Hong Kong. Shortly after he sends his nephew to school, Charles, a former British marine, takes the students hostage and plants bombs around the school. Charles is unhappy because his son was taken away by his ex-wife and her new husband, and they are on their way to America. He demands that his son be brought to him in exchange for the hostages. Cheuk agrees to help Charles and he rushes to the airport with Simna (Charles's brother-in-law) and Hung (a reporter). Even after they find the boy, all is not over yet because their journey back is filled with danger â€” both the police and the thugs are out to get them.
