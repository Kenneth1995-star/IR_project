Nacholer Rani

In 1950, Mitra took up the cause of the Santhals. She was married to Ramendra Nath Mitra, a Zamindar of Ramchandrapur in Nachol.[3][4] She left her lavish life and fought for the ill-treated Santhals. She garnered recognition for her dedication to their cause. She was treated as an uncrowned queen by the Santhals. They gave her the title Rani Ma (Queen mother).[5]
