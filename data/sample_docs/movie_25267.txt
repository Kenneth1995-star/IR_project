Nastik

Shankar's (Amitabh Bachchan) father, who is a village temple priest is murdered by Tiger (Amjad Khan). His mother and sister are torched in their house. After his father, mother and sister are killed, Shankar decides to bring justice by himself and goes to the palace of Tiger. Instead of killing Tiger, Shankar blinds him. Shankar blames God for doing nothing and grows up as a Nastik (atheist). Shankar flees to the city and becomes a thief. He joins forces with Balbir (Pran) and Gauri (Hema Malini). At one time, he is shot by Tiger for stealing his goods. In an attempt to hide, he finds his mother, who he thought was dead in the fire. In a rude awakening, he decides to stop stealing and join with his long lost family. Incidentally, Balbir saves Shankar's sister Shanti (Rita Bhaduri), who is chased by Tiger's men when she goes outside to bring medicine for her mother. Shankar reunites with his long lost mother and sister. Shankar finds out from his sister that the enemy who he thought had killed, is actually alive. He decides to finish him off once and for all.
