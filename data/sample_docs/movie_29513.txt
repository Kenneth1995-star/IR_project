Urimaikural

Ponmedhu, an attractive piece of heaven in the Tamil campaign, in the 70s...
Gobi (MGR) and his elder brother Soundharam Pilai (S.V.Sahasranaman), very close, alive under the same roof, are of very respectable and very respected farmers.
Gobi shares his time also to tease the young women of his village and one, more particularly  : very beautiful Radha (Latha), his betrothed, endowed with a sacred temperament, brave and very roguish.
But overcoats everything, 2 young people love each other profoundly and do not dare it to declare itself really.
Of teasings in mutual harmless quarrels, 2 lovers who only yesterday, bickered do not joke any more at the moment.
They are not any more for the party, because a good-for-nothing, but a son of the only big landed family of neighborhood, Doreswamy (M.N.Nambhiyar) wishes ardently Radha for wife.
Grasping, the father (V.S.Raghavan) of the young woman sees the opportunity there to grow rich and forget the promise made for Gobi ' s family.
Another drama comes to darken more profoundly the picture (board) of this family so welded  : a strong sum of money collected in the village and under the responsibility of Soundharam Pilai is stolen from him by unknowns. Doreswamy is behind this theft because he was always jealous of Gobi and so wishes to damage the brothers, to make dirty their honor especially.
He quenches so also his vengeance to have been corrected by Gobi, some times previously.
To fight this terrible test, Gobi and Soundharam mortgages their most precious good: their ground.
We give them one year, to resolve the situation.
But other painful events are going to precipitate things, very negatively...
