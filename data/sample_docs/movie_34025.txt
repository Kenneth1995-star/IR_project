Evolusi KL Drift 2

Racing life between Zack (Syamsul Yusof) and Sham (Farid Kamil) has not ended yet. Zack, who used to be an illegal racer is currently a professional drifter. After the accident, Sham no longer drifts due to his broken leg and has to walk using the aid of crutches. Soon a female professional drifter called Aleeya (Scha Al-Yahaya) appears. Joe (Aaron Aziz), who managed to escape unhurt from the accident, wants revenge on Zack. Joeâ€™s assistant Ery (Shaheizy Sam) also wants revenge on Zack because he caused his best friend, Karl (played by Iqram Dinzly in the prequel) to get locked up in jail. Joe wants to control the whole drug business syndicate in KL, and Inspector Kamal (Remy Ishak) suspects him for the crimes that involved deaths. What is the outcome of their new race this time? Will they be able to reach the finish line without complication?
