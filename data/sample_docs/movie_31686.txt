Antastulu

Raja Jaganatha Rao (Gummadi ) is an affluent Zamindar who is obsessed with discipline. Everybody in the house never dares to oppose him. He doesn’t show a difference between family members and workers with respect to rules and discipline. If anyone dares to break the rule, he wouldn’t hesitate to beat them up as well. His wife Roopa Devi (G. Varalakshmi) and Elder son Raghu (Akkineni Nageshwara Rao) religiously follow his words whereas the younger son Chinnababu (Nagaraju) finds these rules too annoying. He feels that even a jail is better than the house where he cannot fulfill small wishes. Jaganatha Rao comes to know about the younger son’s ideas and warns him twice not to repeat it again but Chinnababu breaks the rules. A furious Jaganatha Rao attempts to hit Chinnababu and looking at the anger of his father, the latter dies of mental shock.
As a result Jaganatha Rao breaks down mentally. From then he gets bedridden and his past haunts him. He remembers the poor woman whom he loved and who bears his girl child. Before his death he calls Raghu to share his secret and expresses his wish. He tells Raghu to find out the girl somehow and make her an equal member of the family. She is none other than Rani (Bhanumathi) who lives dancing and singing on the streets. Raghu gets Rani to their house and with help of Mala (Krishna Kumari) he sets things right in the house. He teaches a lesson to those Naagu (Jaggaiah) and Joogulu (Nellore Kantha Rao) who plan to get their hands on the property. He makes his father’s dreams come true and marries Mala in the end.
