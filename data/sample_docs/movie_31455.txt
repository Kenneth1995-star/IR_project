Rangoon

The life of Venkat, an unassuming kid in Rangoon, is turned upside down as his family migrates to Chennai in search of livelihood.
He befriends Kumaran and they grow up to be close pals and eventually colleagues working for the gold merchant Gunaseelan.
Venkat's meteoric rise among the ranks earns the good will of his boss who entrusts his shady business deals to him. One such deal goes terribly awry to land Venkat and Kumaran in a load of trouble as they are left to fend for themselves in a race against time to set things right.
