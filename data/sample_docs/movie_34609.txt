Let Me Out

Mu-young (Kwon Hyun-sang) is a 4th-year film student and convenience store clerk. A know-it-all who is quick to pick apart and ridicule the work of others, he is endlessly complaining about the state of the Korean film industry and showing off his vast knowledge of cinema. When a famous indie director (Yang Ik-june) visits his university, his fellow students are starstruck, but Mu-young is unimpressed. At a Q&A session, he mocks the director's most recent work as a commercial sellout. Similarly unimpressed with Mu-young's attitude, the director throws it back at him, unexpectedly "awarding" him a US$5,000 production grant and challenging him to go out and actually shoot a decent film.
The problem is, Mu-young is nowhere close to being prepared, with his unfinished screenplay languishing in a drawer. With no other choice, he gathers together a cast and crew with varying experience, and casts Ah-young (Park Hee-von), the girl he loves, as the protagonist. He sets out to shoot his dream project, a zombie melodrama. But his inexperience, demands and impatience cause everyone around him to go crazy, turning his project into a nightmare. Everything that can go wrong, does, and the shoot faces a series of obstacles and accidents, from casting actors to securing locations and funds. Mu-young comes to realize that the reality of filmmaking is very different from theory, and like love, isn't easy at all.[6]
