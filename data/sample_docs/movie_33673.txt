Magic Tree House

Jack is a shy but confident bookworm and his sister Annie can make friends quickly with both humans and animals. One day, while they were playing together in a forest, they unexpectedly stumble upon a wooden treehouse located in this forest. This magical treehouse allows people to travel across time and space whenever they liked. Morgan le Fay is accidentally transformed into a mouse named Peanuts by Merlin (echoing the plot from books 5-8), and Jack and Annie have to find four magic medallions to rescue her. They visit the late Cretaceous period with dinosaurs (from book 1), a medieval castle (from book 2), the town of Pompeii (from book 13) and a pirate ship (from book 4). At the end, Peanuts is once again turned into Morgan.
