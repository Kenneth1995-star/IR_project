Manase Mandiram

Dr. Raghu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), who dedicated his entire life to the medical profession and runs a Cancer hospital. Once Seeta (Savitri) his ex-lover who forcibly married to another person Ramu (Jaggayya) by her parents comes to his hospital. Ramu is diagnosed to have cancer and he is admitted. Both Raghu & Seeta are very much uncomfortable to interact in front of Ramu. Seeta suspects that Dr. Raghu will not be able to give her husband a fair treatment because of his love interest in her. When she mentions this to him he promises her that he will try his best to save her husband. Ramu overhears this conversation and later suggests to Seeta that she should get married to Dr. Raghu after his death. Ramu is to undergo a major surgery under Dr. Raghu which will decide his fate. Dr. Raghu seized with a feeling that he can't afford to fail in this surgery as it might seem that he was biased due to Seeta. He works hard for the preparation of the surgery, without proper food/sleep for a long time. Finally, at the end the surgery takes place and it is successful but Dr. Raghu dies on the spot due to hypertension. At the end, Ramu and Seeta contract a memorial hospital in the name of Dr. Raghu.
