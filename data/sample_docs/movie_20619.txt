Nothing Personal

In 1975 Belfast, the Troubles is in full effect, erupting into violence once again when a Protestant bar is bombed by rival Catholics, and several people are killed. Only hours later, Protestant fighters Kenny (James Frain) and Ginger (Ian Hart) retaliate by killing a Catholic, starting a full-scale riot. Meanwhile, Liam (John Lynch), a Catholic single father, attempts to help the victims of the fighting, but soon finds himself on the wrong side of the Protestant-Catholic divide.
