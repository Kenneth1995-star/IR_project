Naughty @ 40

Harvinder (Govinda) is a 40-year-old man living in London with his parents Laxminarayan Srivastav (Anupam Kher) and Maya Srivastav (Smita Jaykar), an ardent lover of the lord. He's still a virgin and sleepwalks in the nights. One night he sleepwalks into an unknown white woman's bedroom causing mayhem for her lover until the white woman's husband shows up. Sanjeev's father seeks the help of his employee Shafarat Ali (Shakti Kapoor) and his nephews to help Sanjeev lose his virginity, but all their efforts are futile. This brings embarrassment to LM Kapoor.
Happy's friends attempt to hook him up where one of his friends talks to a Chinese girl who then leads Happy to her room. However, much to the dismay of Happy, he discovers "she" is a man. The next day, Randy, Sandy and Shafarat Ali leads Happy to the massage parlour. Happy then accidentally breaks the female massage parlour's nose. In a fit of fear, they break into a run. LM Kapoor then invites Happy to Uncle Chatur's (Sanjay Mishra) house, who is a heart patient, where Happy is head over heals over his daughter however one night, Happy ends causing trouble for another woman due to sleeping on her bed. Because of his sleep-walking problem, girls reject him.
The family leaves for Manali, where Sanjeev gets married to Gauri (Yuvika Chaudhary), a girl much younger than him. However, Gauri is up to childish pranks all the while, which results in Sanjeev getting into a physical relationship with a London based model who is in the town for photo shoot. Sanjeev thinks nobody will find out, but when Gauri does discover the truth, she gets a rude shock, which brings about a change in her attitude.
