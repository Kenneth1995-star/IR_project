The Rage in Placid Lake

Precocious, bohemian teenager Placid Lake finishes high school, but after having an existential crisis devises a plan to totally reinvent himself as a functioning member of society. With a few weeks spent reading a library of self-help manuals, Lake gets a haircut, bespoke suit, and gets a white collar job working for an insurance agency. Lake has a smart friend Gemma (played by Byrne) who tries to talk him out of his newly found economic rationalism.
Lake is adamant about becoming an acceptable member of society and ignores the signs of disapproval from his parents and best friend. Yet, by continuing his venture to normality, Lake struggles with what to say, think and wear due to his insecurity and neurosis.[1] Lake realizes that living to society's standards does not satisfy him as much as he had hoped. Eventually, this causes him to revert to his original personality and become content with who he is.
