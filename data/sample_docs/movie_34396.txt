The Contact

One day, radio DJ Dong-hyeon (Han Suk-kyu) receives an anonymous package containing a Velvet Underground record. Dong-hyeon hopes that the record was sent by his former lover. He decides to play the song Pale Blue Eyes off of that record. At the same time, a home shopping telemarketer, Soo-hyeon (Jeon Do-yeon) listens to the radio program while driving her car.
The next day, Soo-hyeon makes a request through the internet for Dong-hyeon to play the song again. Dong-hyeon then contacts Soo-hyeon, hoping she is his former girlfriend or someone he knows.
