Gunpoint

In a small town in 1880s Colorado, a gang of outlaws led by Drago (Morgan Woodward) rob a bank and kidnap a saloon singer, Uvalde (Joan Staley). The sheriff, Chad Lucas (Audie Murphy), forms a posse to take off after them, which includes Uvalde's fianc√©, Nate Harlan (Warren Stevens), a young kid, and Lucas's deputy (Denver Pyle), who is secretly in league with the outlaws. During the chase, Nate realises that Chad and Uvalde used to be lovers. The posse battles Indians, horse thieves and conflicts among themselves before discovering Uvalde and defeating the gang.
