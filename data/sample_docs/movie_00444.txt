Peg o' My Heart

As described in a film publication,[3] Margaret "Peg" O'Connell (Taylor), according to her uncle's will, is to be educated in England under the supervision of her aunt, Mrs. Chichester (Lewis). Upon her arrival from Ireland, she is looked down upon by the Chichester household for her lack of culture, and she vows never to become a lady. She meets Jerry, a young man from a neighboring estate, who becomes her friend. Then she discovers that he is Sir Gerald Adair (Hamilton) and rebels at the deception he has been conducting. She also finds out that the only reason her aunt is keeping her is because of compensation from the will. Peg leaves to return home, but finds that she is in love with Gerald. Gerald follows her and proposes.
