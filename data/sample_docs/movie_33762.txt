Doraemon: New Nobita's Great Demonâ€”Peko and the Exploration Party of Five

The movie starts with Gian, Shizuka, Nobita and Suneo discussing going for an adventure in their summer vacation. Suneo and Gian get tired of thinking about this, so they pass this responsibility to Nobita. Nobita asks Doraemon to do so and they launch a rocket on their roof to take photos of each and every small part of the Earth.
Meanwhile, Nobita's mom, Tamako tasks Nobita into picking up some groceries. On his way to the market, he passes the playground where he sees a dog all by itself. Feeling sorry for the dog, Nobita purchases some sausages while running his errands and gives some to the dog. Back home, Nobita and Doraemon look for a better way to find a good place for their adventure after realizing that the satellite would produce over 930 million photos.
Nobita soon discovers that the dog he ran into earlier followed him home. Tamako, who does not allow pets, tells Nobita that her purse is missing. After the dog easily finds the purse through the scent of Tamako's slipper, Nobita is allowed to keep the dog and names him Peko.
