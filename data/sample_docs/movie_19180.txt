Radio Cab Murder

After serving a term in prison for safe-cracking, Fred Martin finds work as a Taxicab driver. He is approached by a gang that recruits ex-cons, but, wishing to go straight, he informs the police and they send him undercover to join the gang and expose its leader. But the gang discovers Martin's identity and tries to kill him by locking him in a deep freezer. He is saved by his cabby friends who ride to the rescue and corner the crooks.[2]
