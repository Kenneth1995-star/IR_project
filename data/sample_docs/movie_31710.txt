Uma Chandi Gowri Shankarula Katha

On a debate among Saptarishis where Bhrigu Maharshi argues that male is responsible for entire nature and where others say nature (female) is the origin of the universe. Bhrigu wanted to clarify his doubt with Lord Shiva. Upon reaching Kailasa, Shiva would be teaching lessons on dance to Goddess Parvati and since they were in the process, he would be ignored by Parvati and Shiva. Patience less Bhrigu curses Parvati to take birth three times on Earth and suffer from human-related misfortune. Parvati also curses Bhrigu to take birth as a demon who suffers mankind. Parvati upon prying to Shiva, He favors Parvati, that She would take birth only one time but as triplets and He will take birth to protect her and convert Her human-related misfortune as a boon with His accompany. The crux of story forms all about how Shiva meets these three women and how He assassinates the demon (Bhrigu). At the climax, Shiva fights the demon (Bhrigu) and releases him from the curse and at the same time Paravati also gets released from all Her human suffering, turns to Goddess and reaches Shiva.
