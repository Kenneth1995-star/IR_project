St. Martin's Lane

Charles Staggers (Charles Laughton) is a London street performer, a "busker," with his partners, Arthur Smith (Gus McNaughton) and Gentry (Tyrone Guthrie).
He protects Liberty, known as Libby (Vivien Leigh), a runaway and pickpocket, when she steals a gold cigarette case from successful song writer Harley Prentiss (Rex Harrison). He then takes her into their troupe, making their trio into a quartet.
Libby attracts the attention of Prentiss and his wealthy friends, who can give her a life and career away from the streets. When she leaves, cruelly rejecting Charles's marriage proposal, he doesn’t want to go on with the act anymore, and becomes an alcoholic. Libby’s career, however, is a big success; she is offered a Hollywood contract. She asks Prentiss to marry her; but, he declines, saying he doesn’t want to be thrown away, like Charles, as a mere stepping stone for her career.
In the press of crowds, waiting to see her, as a big star, Libby sees Charles, and, her old partners, busking on the street the way they used to. Charles asks her for her autograph; but, he is pushed aside by the mob.
