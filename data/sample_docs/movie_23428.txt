Troublesome Night

The film is set in the haunted streets of Hong Kong, with four loosely connected stories put together in one film. A group of youngsters go on a camping trip in the countryside, where Ken encounters a mysterious woman near a grave. After the encounter, his life changes as he becomes a victim of the supernatural. As his friends return to Hong Kong without him, another story begins. Mrs To has made arrangements to celebrate her wedding anniversary with her husband but he does not show up. The outcome of the second story leads to another story about Ken's friend, Jojo, having a romantic affair with a ghost. The fourth story is about Peter Butt visiting a haunted theatre with some of Ken's friends.
