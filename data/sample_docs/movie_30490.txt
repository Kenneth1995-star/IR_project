Maaran

Maaran (Sathyaraj) is a clerk in the district collector’s office. His life centers round his loving wife (Seetha), his son (Raghuvannan) and his daughter (Preethi Varma). Soft spoken, and a Gandhian to the hilt, Maaran does not stand by any smear on the Mahatma’s name. Being a staunch patriot, he had even named his son Sudhandhiram.
After topping at the state level, Maaran's son Sudhandhiram wins admission to a medical college, where he is in for a rough time, ragged mercilessly by the sadistic Shivadas (Robert) and his cronies. Nonetheless, Anjali (Santhoshi) falls in love with Sudhandhiram. Matters run wild when Sudhandhiram returns Shivadas’ humiliations with a tight slap, and defeats him in the college elections. The humiliation of Shivadas makes matters even wild when Sudhandhiram pays for it with his life. Shivadas packs the corpse in a suitcase and disposes of it. But soon, Shivadas is hauled up for the murder. However, Shivadas manages to get a clean-chit of the case, thanks to his influential father. Seetha becomes lunatic due to the emotional shock. The grieving father, Maaran, takes it on himself to justify his son’s murder.
Maaran traces out the conspirators one by one, and have their evil terminate themselves, justifying his own way of justice. At the end of Maaran kills the doctor and gets surrounded in the court. He gets hook in jail.
