Danger Has Two Faces

Many years ago, Inspector Kam Chi-kin (Bryan Leung) killed an innocent man and decided to resign from the police force. He then became a professional killer, paid by Uncle Hung (Che Hung), and disguises as a pet store owner in order to earn money to raise his son. His best friend, Bobby Chow Fuk-cheung (Fei Xiang) recently returned from UK and works under Superintendent Lau Cheuk-aang (Paul Chu). Chow has been investigating recent murder cases that were done by Kam. Later, as one of his colleague Sam (Kirk Wong) is murdered, Chow discovered the mastermind behind these cases were actually Superintendent Lau. Lau then murders one of his subordinate Man (Cheung Ming-man), mistaken him to have discovered his identity. Later, Uncle Hung takes Kam's son hostage and orders him to kill Chow. Kam later disguises Chow's murder and they both confront Lau, Hung, the gang and two police officers Wai (Chan Chik-wai) and Chicken Blood.
