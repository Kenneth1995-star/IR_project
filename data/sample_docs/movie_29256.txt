Punar Jenmam

Shankar (Sivaji Ganesan) is a successful artist and lives with his mother (Kannamba). He takes to alcohol, and as a result, messes up his life. A woman in his village, Parvathi (Padmini), is in love with him, but she is unable to make him quit alcohol. Her brother’s wife Kamakshi (Sundari Bai), however, hates Parvathi, and when she wins ₹1 lakh (equivalent to ₹63 lakh or US$96,000 in 2017) in a lottery, it only makes her headstrong. Parvathi suffers the brunt of her ill-treatment. Kamakshi’s daughter, Pushpa (Ragini), meanwhile, falls in love with her music teacher. The mother decides to get them married even though her son does not approve.
To change himself, Shankar goes to Madras, leads a reformed life, and earns well with his artistic skills. Kamakshi, meanwhile, brings his family house to auction. Shankar’s mother is shocked and later passes away. However, just in time, Shankar comes with his earnings and stops the auction. He leaves his village once more. Parvathi, who is engaged to marry someone, is heartbroken and consumes poison. Shankar rushes to save her and gives her a new lease of life and the lovers are united.
