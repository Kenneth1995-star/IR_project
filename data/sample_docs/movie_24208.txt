Chandidas

Chandidas (K. L. Saigal), a lover of truth and humanity is the disciple of Acharya (M. Ansari), a priest in the temple. Baiju (Pahari Sanyal), a washer-man lives with his wife and sister Rami (Uma Sashi) in the village where the Zamindar (landowner) Gopinath (Nawab) though outwardly religious and respecting the Brahmins is an evil man. Gopinath has a henchman Sarju (H. Siddiqui) who carries out his dirty work. Rami sweeps the compound of the temple where Chandidas sees her while he carries on his duties in the temple. They fall in love which causes resentment in Gopichand who has been eyeing Rami, but when she spurns his advances he has her kidnapped. His wife comes to the rescue of Rami and helps her escape. The Zamindar goons go after her and assault her. Gopichand convinces the priest that Chandidas should be punished and made to repent for associating with a lower caste woman. Chandidas agrees to this but then sees Ramiâ€™s injuries and realises the duplicity of the so-called pious men. He renounces his life in the village and leaves it accompanied by Baiju, his wife and Rami.
