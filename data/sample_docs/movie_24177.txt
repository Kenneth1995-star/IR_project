Abby Sen

Kolkata 2013. Abby Sen is a 30-year-old television producer. He is academically brilliant, has a strong background in science and watching science fiction films is his greatest passion. But his programmes on television are never popular and fail to make a mark on the TRP ratings. And that is perhaps the only reason why Abby has lost no less than seven jobs. Every time he is fired, his wife Somy gets hysterical and throws down everything that she could lay her hands on. So Abby has not disclosed his last dismissal to her.
By sheer coincidence, Abby meets a self-styled scientist who claims to have discovered a time-travel capsule. The scientist volunteers to take Abby back in time when getting a job was not that difficult. But he has certain conditions, which Abby must fulfill. Finding all options bleak, Abby decides to agree to his conditions and travel 33 years back in time, that is, in 1980.
Thereafter, a series of unforeseen incidents and intricacies of relationships make Abbyâ€™s life in 1980 as eventful as ever. But flung between the two worlds of 1980 and 2013 both in his personal and professional life, Abby represents the predicament of a man struggling to survive in this competitive world.
