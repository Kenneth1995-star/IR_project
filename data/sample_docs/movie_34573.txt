Peach Tree, The !The Peach Tree

Sang-hyun and Dong-hyun were born as conjoined twins with two heads sharing one body. Dong-hyun has the full control of their shared body, except his brother's head which is attached to the back of his. The two can never look at each other directly, as their heads always face the opposite direction. Dong-hyun looks "normal" as long as he wears his hoodie, which fully covers his brother's face. The two have lived nearly 30 years in a remote house with their father, who tells them not to go outside the property. However, things change when their father brings Seung-ah, a bubbly, good-hearted young artist, to the house to help Dong-hyun publish a children's book ― one of his lifelong dreams.[14]
Despite having the same body, the brothers share little else. While Sang-hyun is patient and generous, Dong-hyun is always questioning something and extremely selfish. Dong-hyun gradually builds a grudge against Sang-hyun, blaming him for his unhappiness and isolated life. Sang-hyun, who lets his brother do whatever he wants, does not recognize his own wants and needs until he gets to know Seung-ah. And things worsen as Dong-hyun, who wants to appear as a "normal writer" for his upcoming book, desperately tries hiding what he thinks as his ultimate flaw ― his own brother.[14]
Throughout the film, peaches appear frequently.[15] Before the twins were born, their parents enjoyed a date near a peach tree. Near the same tree is where the young twins saw their mother for the last time, since she gradually lost her sanity and health after giving birth to them. The tree and its fruits are witness to Sang-hyun and Dong-hyun's history; it sees the twins' beginning, their loss, and their isolated dreams and experiences.[14]
