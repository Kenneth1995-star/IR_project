Kumara Raja

A wealthy man (T. S. Balaiah) has a son (J. P. Chandrababu) who spends his money and time singing and dancing with girls. The father tries to marry him to a modest girl (M. N. Rajam). But the son spends most of his time with his girl friend (Suryakala). How the son is brought back to normal life forms the rest of the story.[2]
