It Was You Charlie

It Was You Charlie (the title refers to On the Waterfront)[5][6][7]explores the lonely life of Abner (Michael D. Cohen) a short, schluby, suicidally-depressed former teacher-artist turned graveyard shift doorman and the fierce sibling rivalry he endures (if not imagines) with Tom (Aaron Abrams), his tall, handsome, lady-killing brother. Abner also harbours a tragic secret that has debilitated his professional and personal life while Tom not only seems to have everything going for him, but also scores with Madeleine (Anna Hopkins), the babe our haplessly loveable schlemiel has long held a torch for.[8] Zoe, a mysterious young blonde cab driver in a bright yellow beret, appears in Abnerâ€™s life, but for reasons he cannot understand. Nor does he understand the repeated appearance of strange men in trench coats who seem to follow him wherever he goes. There is also something about a painting in his local diner that mesmerizes him. Estranged from his family and even further estranged from a normal life, Abner must make sense of the things around him and come to terms with what has haunted him these years. [9]After meeting Zoe, something magical happens to Abner as he begins a quest to seek redemption, and reconcile his conflicted past.[10]
