Krishna Arjun

Ramnath, a freedom fighter had died for the country, and his wife Sharda Yadav lives a poor but very respectable lifestyle with her two sons, Krishna and Arjun, in a small rural town in India. Years pass by, Krishna and Arjun have both grown up. Krishna and his mom would like to send Arjun to Bombay to study and become a professional. Accordingly, Arjun travels to Bombay, where he resides in a hostel, meets a beautiful collegian named Poonam, and both fall in love with each other. Then Arjun gets devastating news of the passing away of his mother. He travels home and finds that nothing is the same anymore, for Krishna has been arrested, found guilty of brutally raping and then killing a young school-teacher widow by the name of Meera, and unable to bear this shock of this disgrace, his mother has died. Arjun must now meet with Krishna and find out what had happened after he left town, and whether there is any truth to Krishna's crime.
