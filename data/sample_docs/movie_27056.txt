Wedding Anniversary

Kahani (Mahie Gill) and her husband Nirbhay (Priyanshu Chatterjee) had planned to celebrate their wedding anniversary in Goa but due to some last minute work Nirbhay stays back and Kahani has to travel alone. While she waits for her husband in Goa, she picks up a book to read written by her favourite author Nagarjun (Nana Patekar) and after a short while a visitor rings the doorbell of her house who turns out to be none other than Nagarjun himself. The conversation that follows between the two of them where Nagarjun talks about love, it's true meaning and the relevance it has in our lives forms the crux of this film's story.
