Anjani Putra

Viraj aka Raj (Puneeth) is a moneylender and also the heir to the Raj Group, a cloth manufacturing conglomerate, until he was disowned by his mother and uncle of his joint family Anjana Devi (Ramya Krishnan) due to some misunderstanding. He meets a rich girl Geetha (Rashmika Mandanna) at a mall, who soon falls in love with him for his good nature. One day, Raj saves the Additional Superintendent of Police Surya Prakash(P. Ravi Shankar) and his wife from a group of thugs who work for Bhairava (Mukesh Tiwari), a businessman and contract killer who kills anyone to acquire their land and money. As Surya Prakash was transferred to capture Bhairava, the latter had planned to kill him. Bhairava also plans to illegally grab land sold to a village temple by Raj's late father. These two incidents cause enmity between Raj and Bhairava.
Raj soon reconciles with the rest of his family and returns home. When the land is formally sold to the temple, an irate Bhairava assaults Raj's uncle Ramaswamy, following which Raj beats him up in retaliation and breaks his hand. A bitter battle erupts between Raj and Bhairava, with Raj, assisted by Surya Prakash, subduing Bhairava's henchmen and thwarting all attempts by Bhairava to destroy his family. Raj, seeking revenge for his mother's injury, rushes to Jodhpur, where Bhairava is hiding and kills him.
