Kidnapping Freddy Heineken

The film takes place in 1983, primarily in Amsterdam and centers on a group of five Dutch friends: Willem Holleeder, Cor van Hout, Jan Boellard, Martin Erkamps and Frans Meijer. Looking for easy money, they decide to kidnap Heineken owner, the tycoon Freddy Heineken, in order to achieve a very high ransom. Although capturing Heineken and his driver Ab Doderer successfully, the group eventually faces difficulties due to their lack of experience in crime. They fail to negotiate with the police, and Cor feels it is his duty to take care of his pregnant wife, Sonja. After Heineken is finally released by the police, Willem and Cor flee to Paris, where they plan to remain hidden. However, Cor experiences strong emotions to phone call Sonja, a dangerous action that could easily reveal their location to the police tracing. He is initially reluctant and has arguments with Willem, but ultimately gives in to his feelings and calls Sonja, resulting in Cor and Willem being arrested by the French police while leaving their apartment.
