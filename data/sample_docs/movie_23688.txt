Strawberry Cliff

Kate has a supernatural power, that with one look, she can tell a person's time of death without any mistake. One day in a restaurant in Seattle, she meets Jason who is going to die a few hours later. She made a deal with Jason that if he reincarnates to his next life, he will tell her about it and let her know what is reincarnation.
That night, as Kate predicted, Jason died and that last moment before he dies, he saw a horrible image.
Days later, Kate receives a "reincarnation" phone call. Frightened, she follows the phone caller's instruction and leaves from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and there she meets Daren. Daren is a bartender, because he has an "incomplete spirit", he feels depressed. Darren and Kate investigate about the journey of reincarnation and found out the truth of the horrible image that Jason saw before his death.
Kate finds out that her father, the first person whose death she ever predicted, was the cause of all the deaths occurring around her. She was stricken with health problems since her birth and was never supposed to live. So her father, once dead, has been killing people around her to preserve Kate's life. "Others' lives aren't as important as yours" he would say.
The final scene shows Jean, the third person who shares a mind with Jason and Darren, finally meeting Kate. Jean tells her the tale of the strawberry cliff, emphasizing on how sweet death is.
