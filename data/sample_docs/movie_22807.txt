Xuan Zang

During the Tang Dynasty's era of "Zhen Guan" (era name during rule of Emperor Taizong), the young Xuan Zang monk, in his quest for finding the knowledge in Buddhism, embarked on a journey to India, that is fraught with perils and dangers. He encounters natural disasters, and sees the sufferings of the common people. Soldiers get in his way, his disciple betrays him, he struggles through deserts, runs short on food and water, all in the quest for Buddha's teachings. He finally arrives in India, and studies Buddhism in earnest. By the time he returns to China, he is already 50 years old.
