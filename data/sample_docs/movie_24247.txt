Dharti Mata

Ashok (K. L. Saigal) and Ajay (Jagdish Sethi) have different notions about the progress of the country. Ashok supports agriculture and going back to the villages while Ajay is in favour of industrialisation and technology. Ajay is from a rich family and has to go to UK for further studies in engineering. He asks Ashok to come with him. Ashok refuses and decides to go the village and help the farmers. Ajay’s sister Pratibha (Kamlesh Kumari) is in love with Ashok who is unaware of her feelings. When Ashok faces hardships in the village she secretly assists him by sending money to buy new machinery for the farm. Ashok and his colleague are frustrated in their attempts several times by Chowdhary, the village headman. Ashok meets and falls in love with a village girl Gauri (Uma Shashi) who stays with her blind father (K. C. Dey). Ajay returns from abroad and is told of a rich coal mine. This is located under Ashok’s field. Ajay forgoes mining the land and decides to buy the land that Ashok has been farming to safeguard it for him. Ashok tells Ajay his plans of marrying Gauri. Ajay is stunned and upset for his sister. For the farmers there is distress when the monsoons fail. They face a drought situation. This is when Ajay decides to mine the field for coal. However the disagreements are sorted out and Ajay helps out with new ideas and approves Ashok’s method of co-operative farming.
