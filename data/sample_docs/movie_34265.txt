The Groom

A German named Helmut (Philippe Reinhardt), having fallen in love with a Russian girl named Alena (Svetlana Smirnova-Martsinkevich), whom he met in Berlin, arrives in Russia on the 9th of May to ask for her hand in marriage. Having welcomed the groom, Alena goes to the village to introduce him to her relatives. But at this time Tolya (Sergei Svetlakov) - her ex-husband, is visiting the village, who suddenly decided to get his wife back.
Serious rivalry awakes when the ex-husband is introduced to the new groom. All friends, relatives, residents of the neighboring village, businessman Erofeev (Sergey Burunov), who bought the house next door, and even a tankman with a snake - all are involved in the family affair.
