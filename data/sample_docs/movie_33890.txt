The Long Excuse

He has largely fallen out of love with his wife Natsuko (Eri Fukatsu) a hairdresser. When she dies in a bus crash, he is in bed with his mistress. Despite this, he feels no guilt, which disgusts his mistress, who already racked with guilt, leaves him.

When Yoichi finds a new partner, Sachio has to leave the children. He ends up writing a book a new book the experience, and plays an unexpected role in the children's lives, eventually finding some closure for the loss of his wife.
