He has a loving girlfriend Meera (Ramya Nambeesan), and life seems to be one big party for him. However his life takes a U-turn when he gets suddenly fired from his job. One day, by mistake, a box arrives on his doorstep containing Rs. 5 Crores which is a part of settlement between two bad guys Ilavarasu (Kota Srinivasa Rao) and Kamatchi Sundaram (Sayaji Shinde). Moneykandan wants to run away with the money and start a new life in another country, but he finds that he has caught a tiger by the tail.[4]
