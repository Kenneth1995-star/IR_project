Under the Tonto Rim

A complete failure as a ranch cowhand and then a chuckwagon driver, Tonto Daley's embarrassment is total after accidentally causing a wagon to tip over and his boss's daughter Nina Weston to fall into a creek.
Tonto hits the trail with his tail between his legs, taking a job from Porky and Tom to become a hog farmer. He is miserable and lonely, and things get worse when former foreman Munther tries to railroad Tonto in the rustling of some cattle. He finds out Porky and Tom are in on it, and Nina becomes Tonto's ally in the fight to make things right.
