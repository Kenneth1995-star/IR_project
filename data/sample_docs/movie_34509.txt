Green Days: Dinosaur and I

Yi-rang is in a race and falls behind. To save herself from shame, she fakes a fall. After that competition she resolves to never compete again. A new transfer student from Seoul comes to school. Her name is Soo-min and all the boys fall for her as she is very pretty.
Yi-rang exits the movie theater to the restroom after the movie is over. She sobs in front of the mirror and then wipes her tears as Soo-min comes out of a stall. Yi-rang meets Soo-min again at a record shop.
A former track teammate of Yi-rang tries to persuade her to return to the track team. Yi-rang refuses. Meanwhile, a boy, Cheol-soo, is in a makeshift hang glider and his friends tries to warn him against flying.
Yi-rang's radio breaks and she takes it the repair shop. She meets a boy from her school. Yi-Rang mistakes his name for Charles, which is his nickname. His name is Cheol-soo and he hopes to become an astronaut. He has an uncle who owns the repair shop. Yi-rang's radio is fixed but it starts raining. She takes an umbrella and forgets her radio at the shop.
Cheol-soo and Yi-rang go on a trip to see a dinosaur footprint. Once back home, Yi-rang races in the marathon.
