Sex Kittens Go to College

Collins College's administrators are expecting new professor Dr. Mathilda West, who holds 13 degrees and speaks 18 languages. What they aren't expecting is the buxom blonde beauty who gets off the train.
Dr. West has an effect on everybody, from public relations director George Barton, who is the boyfriend of jealous dean Myrtle Carter, to football star Woo Woo Grabowski, who gets very nervous around beautiful women, including student Jody, who loves him.
A campus computer, affectionately known as Thinko, has a knack for knowing the future, including winning lottery numbers and race horses. A hoodlum, Legs Rafertino, comes looking for Thinko, thinking he's a bookie, while foreign exchange student Suzanne tries to interview Legs for her thesis.
Barton exposes the fact that Dr. West was once the Tallahassee Tassle Tosser, a stripper. The school's primary benefactor, Admiral Wildcat MacPherson, is concerned. Dr. West defends her former occupation and even gives a tassle demonstration that hypnotizes several of the men.
Woo Woo wins enough money on Thinko's gambling advice to marry Jody and buy a car. Myrtle dyes her hair blonde and woos Wildcat MacPherson. And not wanting to stay where she's not wanted, Dr. West prepares to leave town, only to have Barton steal a fire engine and race to catch up with her.
