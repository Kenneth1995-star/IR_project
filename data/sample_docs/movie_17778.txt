Suburban Mayhem

Katrina (Emily Barclay) is a 19-year-old single mum who's planning to get away with murder. Katrina lives in a world of petty crime, fast cars, manicures and blow-jobs. A master manipulator of men living at home with her failure of a father in suburban Golden Grove, Katrina will stop at nothing to get what she wants - even murder. When her father threatens to contact social services and take away her child, Katrina sets in motion a plan to wreak suburban mayhem that will leave a community in shock and make Katrina infamous in a way even she never dreamed of.
It is loosely based upon the notorious murders by Mark Valera, and later his sister Belinda van Krevel and her then-partner Keith Schreiber, of Frank Arkell and David O'Hearn, and Jack van Krevel, respectively.
