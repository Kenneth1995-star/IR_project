Wealthy Lata refuses to obey her widower father's instructions to get married to equally wealthy Rajan, Rajan is the second son of Sikanker Lal Thakkar, her dad's business partner. She runs away from home, and shortly thereafter, her father locates her living with a truck-driver, Vishwa Pratap, and his pretty sister, Lakshmi. She refuses to return home. She tells her father that she would marry Vishma instead of Rajan. She soon regrets her decision when she finds out that Vishwa has been arrested for killing a male named Billa, and may have to spend his entire life behind bars or be hanged.
