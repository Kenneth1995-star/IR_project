Kootathil Oruthan

Arvind, an ordinary Joe who is not noticed by any, be it at home, school or among friends falls in love with Janani, a class topper and an all-rounder who excels in sports and extra-curricular activities. A loner by nature, he is smitten by Janani and in his quest to be closer to her, he even enrolls himself in the same college where she studies. She rejects him when he expresses his love for her. Kootathil Oruthan captures the journey of Arvind, an ordinary middle-bencher, and his travails after being rejected by the love of his life.
