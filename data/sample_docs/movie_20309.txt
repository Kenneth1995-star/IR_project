The Stud

Fontaine Khaled is the London wife of a wealthy but boring businessman. She spends his money on her nightclub, Hobo, and partying. She hires a manager, Tony, to run her club, but it is understood that his job security is dependent on his satisfying her nymphomaniac demands. Tony loses interest in Fontaine, and turns his attention to her young stepdaughter, who uses him to get back at Fontaine for cheating on her father. Fontaine then dumps Tony and is divorced by her husband for adultery.
