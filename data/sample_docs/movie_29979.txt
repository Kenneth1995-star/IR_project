Solaiyamma

Solaiyamma (Sukanya) is a mother-less woman who is looked after by her father (Vinu Chakravarthy). She has been promised in marriage with her relative Balraj (Rahul) and they are in love. Vairavan (Karikalan) is a heartless muscular man who spreads terror among the villagers and rapes the village girls. One night, Vairavan enters Solaiyamma's house and tries to rape Solaiyamma but she stands against him and Vairavan runs away. The entire village thinks that she has been raped including her relatives and then her father commits suicide. Thereafter, she is rejected by the village. Vairavan tortures her psychologically to spend a night with him. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
