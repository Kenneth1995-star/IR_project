A Yank in Ermine

An American airman (Thompson) inherits the lordship of an English village. Although he is initially reluctant, his fiance (Decker) encourages him to accept it, after she hears how much the estate is worth. When he arrives in England with his two buddies (Pertwee and Lloyd Jr.), he falls for the daughter (Middleton) of the owner of the neighbouring estate - but she is also engaged to be married.
