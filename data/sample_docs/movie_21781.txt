Deadly Companion (Double Negative)

Michael Taylor, played by Michael Sarrazin, is tormented by his sheer lack of memory concerning the night his wife was found brutally killed. Michael's girlfriend Paula (Susan Clark) helps him attempt to make sense of it all. Anthony Perkins plays a blackmailer; Maury Chaykin, Kenneth Welsh and Michael Ironside appear in minor roles.
Several cast members of the comedy show SCTV appear in this film, all playing small dramatic roles. (Director George Bloomfield had directed SCTV from 1977 through 1979, and brought the cast into the fold.) John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Dave Thomas all have minor or bit parts; only O'Hara is in more than one scene, and Levy is visible for less than five seconds. It was the film debut for both O'Hara and Thomas.
Some later video releases of the film misleadingly give some or all of the SCTV cast top billing. In the actual film credits, no SCTV member is billed higher than 11th.
