Shikari

Sultan (Shakib Khan) is a professional assassin who had run away from home in his childhood after being convicted of attempting to murder his father. Rahul Dev, an influential child trafficker hires Sultan to kill prominent Judge Rudro Chowdhury (Sabyasachi Chatterjee), since he is handling the inquiry and verdict on Rahul Dev's child trafficking case in Kolkata.[7] Sultan arrives in Kolkata and attempts to murder Judge Chowdhury by sniping, but misfires due to large crowd and media around the Judge.[12] The West Bengal police force chases after him, but ultimately fails to catch him. After Rahul Dev insults him for his inability, Sultan is angry with himself, and vows to kill Judge Chowdhury within ten days.[13][14]
Sultan enters Judge Chowdhury's household disguising as a servant, and slowly begins to win over the members of the family.[15]
