Where's George?

The film is about Alf Scodger's attempts to fool his overbearing wife. As a result of these attempts, he accidentally discovers that he has a talent for rugby league and is picked to play for his local Yorcaster club against their rivals Oldcastle from Lancashire.
'George' is a foal that Alf buys and then loses. While playing in the rugby match, Alf spots George in the next field and whilst running to recapture the foal, catches the ball and scores the match-winning try.
A local dignitary watching the match sees him score the try and this leads to Alf and his wife becoming reconciled.
