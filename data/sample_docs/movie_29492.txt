Muthuraman, a college lecturer, falls in love with his student Manjula and marries her. However, the couple's sexual life is a failure, causing intense agony to Manjula's father, Ashokan who is keen to have grandchildren. When all other means fail, Ashokan approaches a psychiatrist, who finds out that Muthuraman's inability to have sex with Manjula may have something to do with his intense affection for his mother, who had died just six months before Muthuraman met Manjula. How the doctor cajoles Manjula into solving her husband's illness forms the climax.
