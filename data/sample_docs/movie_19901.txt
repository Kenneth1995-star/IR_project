The Viking Queen

According to her father's wishes, Queen Salina agrees to share the rule of Icena with Justinian, a Roman. This decision angers both the bloodthirsty Druids and Romans less just than Justinian. As the two rulers fall in love, the Druids and the Romans begin to plot their downfall. It's not long before the hills of Britain are stained with the lovers blood.[2]
The title of the film caused much confusion, because there are no Norse Vikings in the movie. However, another meaning of the word "viking" is that of a raider or plunderer, of which there are many such characters in this film.
The plot combines elements of life of the historic queen Boudica (featuring the Iceni tribe, combat chariots) with elements seemingly drawn from Vincenzo Bellini's opera Norma, though that is set in Gaul.
