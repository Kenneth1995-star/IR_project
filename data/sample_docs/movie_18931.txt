Her Favourite Husband

Mild mannered Italian bank clerk Antonio, much dominated by his English wife Dorothy, is the double of Leo L'Americano, a local gangster. The gangster kidnaps Antonio and takes his place as husband in the family, to give him cover for a big bank robbery, which he plans to pin on Antonio. Farcical confusions ensue.
