At this juncture, the Lucky is confronted with another problem. His foreign returned daughters Honey (Sonali Joshi) Anju (Sony Raj) & Manju (Swapna Madhuri) are too fast for him to make them agree for an arranged marriage with the sons of his close pal.

After that, guys could ditch girls so that they get back to their dad to ask forgiveness and accept his proposal. Lucky asks these three friends to do the roles of lovers. These friends attract the girls and when its time to ditch them, they found it too discouraging as they were offered five-star luxuries by the Lucky during that time. So they decide to double cross him by marrying his daughters.
