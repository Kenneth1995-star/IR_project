They Came from Beyond Space

Several meteors fall in a field in England. Those who approach them are seemingly taken over, and barricade the area from intruders. A scientist is immune to the takeover due to a metal plate in his head. He enlists the assistance of a friend, who must melt down his silver cricket trophies to make a helmet to protect him. Although initially claiming that the takeover is benign, the aliens attempt to remove the metal plate from the scientist but are thwarted and learn the human value of courtesy.
