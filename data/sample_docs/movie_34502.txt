Meet the In-Laws

Naive, pure-hearted Hyun-joon writes romance comics under the pseudonym "Hyun-ji." He becomes pen pals with Da-hong, and the two fall in love and begin dating. When Da-hong reveals that her father is forcing her to go on matchmaking dates with other men, Hyun-joon impulsively decides to propose to her. But Hyun-joon hails from humble roots in South Jeolla Province, and the couple knows that Da-hong's wealthy Gyeongsang family will instantly disapprove of him because of this. Unbeknownst to them, their respective fathers were also bitter rivals in high school baseball. So when Hyun-joon goes to Busan to ask for Da-hong's hand in marriage, he hides his accent and pretends to be from Apgujeong, the ritziest area in Seoul. As her relatives scrutinize, intimidate and spy on him, Hyun-joon is determined to overcome all their obstacles and marry Da-hong.
