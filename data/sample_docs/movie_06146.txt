Masterson of Kansas

Bat Masterson (George Montgomery) is a gunslinger. Masterson, Wyatt Earp (Bruce Cowling) and Doc Holliday (James Griffith) come together in a common cause. The three intend to protect an impending land exchange between honest rancher Merrick (John Maxwell) and peace-seeking Indian chief Yellow Hawk (Jay Silverheels) against the crooked chicanery of land baron Clay Bennett (David Bruce).[1]
