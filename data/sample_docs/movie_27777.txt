Red Indians

A forest smuggle, played by Mansoor Ali Khan, lives in the jungle and smuggles sandalwood. He is also involved with other anti-social behaviour and forest controlling activities like robberies, dacoity, murders and drug pedalling. He consequently kidnaps an electrician Vikram and takes him to the jungle, forcing him to teach him how to make explosives. Vikram refuses to help create bombs and is subsequently falsely accused of murder. The rest of the story is about how Vikram proves his innocence to police investigators.[4]
