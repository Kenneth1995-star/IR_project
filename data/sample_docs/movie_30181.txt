Ponnazhagi Naachiyar (Srividya) is a panchayathu chief since the death of her husband Ramadurai (Ravichandran), she has two sonsÂ : the elder Kathirvel (Radha Ravi) is an uneducated brute who woos his relative Shenbagam whereas Chinnadurai (Ponvannan) studies in the city.
One day, at the village court, a poor woman claims that the rich Sidambaram (R. K) and she are in love with each other and she is now pregnant. Ponnazhagi clears Sidambaram due to a lack of evidence and states that the poor woman is greedy. The poor woman later tries to commit suicide but the kind-hearted Rajadurai (Karthik) saves her at time. Rajadurai later beats up Sidambaram and he admits its mistake, so Rajadurai arranges their wedding, dismissing Ponnazhagi's judgement. Rajadurai was adopted and brought up by the Muslim man Rowther (V. K. Ramasamy).

Considering the circumstances, Rajadurai arranges the ceremony. When Kathirvel becomes aware of this matter, Kathirvel and Rajadurai fight. Kathirvel then threatens Shenbagam and Mallika to kill them if the two sisters break the village customs once again. Shenbagam cannot bear Kathirvel's mental torture so Rajadurai promises Shenbagam to get married with her.

There, an half naked-man ran away from the house. The villagers suspected the innocent Parvathi for having an affair with another man and locked her in her house until the end of the death ceremony. Later, Ponnazhagi plotted to kill Parvathi and Rajadurai. Rowther then adopted Rajadurai and Parvathi disappeared. Rowther and Rajadurai left the village and then came back many years later.
