Sirai

In an inebriated state, Anthony, a landlord, rapes Bhagirathi, the wife of a Brahmin priest. When her husband rejects her, she moves in with her rapist (after being encouraged by a kind policeman) and eventually develops an attachment for him. Following Anthony's death, she prefers to be known as his widow and refuses to rejoin her husband.
