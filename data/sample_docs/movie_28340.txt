Roshan (Sunny Wayne) is a cosmetic surgeon and a casanova by nature. Abu (Sanju), a budding filmmaker and Joe (Praveen), a TV show producer, are his friends. Joe has just been ditched by his girl friend Ann (Poojitha Menon). A devastated Joe heads over to Goa along with his friends to get over the tragedy that has befallen him. At Goa, Roshan and Abu have a merry time with "spicy girls" Alice (Rohini Mariam Idicula) and Sania (Parvathy Nair), while Joe stalks Ann who has arrived at the beach town as well with her new boy friend Peter (Shani). Meanwhile, Joe falls for Anjali (Sija Rose), a hotel receptionist, and he decides to stay in Goa even after his friends leave for Kochi.
After all the adventure, Roshan and Abu, on their way back to Kochi, receive a phone call from the "spicy girls" informing that one of them is an AIDS patient and by now either Roshan or Abu will be infected. Roshan and Abu return to Goa to know more about the girls but in vain. A few days pass and then they get another call from the spicy girls informing that the infected one is Roshan. They also inform that they did this not out of sadism but was taking revenge on Roshan who had ditched their best friend Anita George who turned into a lunatic after the breakup and committed suicide. Roshan is devastated by the news of his disease. He feels a kind of loneliness.
Once he finds his ex-wife Maya(Merin Mathew) with another man which adds to his feelings. It is shown that Roshan and Maya have been separated since six months after Maya discovers that her husband has been cheating her. When Roshan finds everyone moving away from him, he feels very lonely and decides to commit suicide. However, in the final scene, it is shown that the whole Goa episode was a trap planned by Maya, Abu and the spicy girls to prove Roshan the value of relationship.
