Papa Kehte Hai

Sweety (Mayuri Kango) lives with her mother (Navni Parihar), maternal grandmother (Suhas Joshi) and grandfather (Tiku Talsania). She is very rebellious, emotional and high-strung, and does not get along well with her classmates in school. All she knows is that she is not permitted to talk about her dad at home. She finds out that he is in the Seychelles and runs away there.
When she gets to the Seychelles, she can't find her dad, whom she has been so anxious to meet. One link is the death of marine archaeologist, Mr. Gandhibhai, who only knows where her dad is. Coincidentally, her dad is in the same hotel which she is in. He is living with another woman, Swati Sinha, who had divorced another male. Her dad is not at all thrilled to have a teenage daughter come and interrupt his life and affairs. In the Seychelles, Sweety meets Rohit Dixit (Jugal Hansraj) and they fall in love with each other. Mr. Anand and Sweety have developed a father-daughter relationship, unaware to the fact that they are related. Later, the story has several twists, which ultimately ends on a happy note.
