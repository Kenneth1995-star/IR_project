I Live on Danger

Jeff Morrell is an ambitious radio reporter. The news of the day is the prison release of gambler Eddie Nelson, who actually was the fallguy for a criminal named Joey Farr.
While exclusively covering a ship's fire, Jeff falls for Susan Richards, but knows her to be Eddie's companion. It turns out she's Eddie's sister, not his girl, but Susan resents it when Jeff's reporting gets Eddie arrested and convicted on a new charge.
District Attorney Lamber is in cahoots with the crooks. Farr tries to flee, but is tracked to a Pennsylvania coal mine. Jeff gets there first and manages to broadcast Farr's confession, then barely get away when Farr sets off a blast of TNT. Susan loves Jeff for heroically rescuing her brother.
