Veerappu

The story revolves around an ego clash between father and son. Puli (Sundar C) is a local rowdy and the son of a math teacher Vedhukannu (Prakash Raj). Vedhukannu hates his son for being a rowdy and for not being proficient in mathematics.
As part of a flashback, it is shown that young Puli was very good in physics, but his father, being a math teacher, wanted him to excel in math which he was unable to do. As a result of repeated physical and mental abuse, the boy takes the wrong route to grow up. In the meantime, rival gangs and police try to kill Puli, but he is accidentally saved by his half-sister, a daughter from an affair that his father had.
Puli helps his half-sister in return for her unexpected help and vouches for her safety. The rival gangs kill her and put the blame on his father. How Puli brings the truth to light and unites with his family completes the rest of the movie.
