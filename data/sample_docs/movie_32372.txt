Ravi (Ravi Teja) works as an assistant director and Narayana (M. S. Narayana) as co-director for director Idly Viswanath(Brahmanandam) in the Telugu film industry. During the shooting Ravi meets Sandhya (Siya Gautham), a group dancer. Sandhya' s sister Surekha (Surekha Vani) get married to Rambabu (Krishna Bhagavaan) who harasses her only to exploit Sandhya. Ravi narrates an interesting story to the producer (Sayaji Shinde). But he is not ready to take the risk with a debutant director like Ravi.
Meanwhile, a rich goon Yadu (Supreet Reddy), who usurps prime lands casts his eyes on Sandhya and Rambabu tries to make use of this in his favour. At this juncture, Ravi narrates the story to hero Mallik (Subbaraju) who also expresses his doubts regarding its feasibility. When Ravi pleads for a chance, he agrees for a trial shoot and they seek the help of Sandhya and other friends. Popular director VV Vinayak asks Ravi for a heroine. Having seen Sandhya's performance in the trial shoot, he books her.
When Sandhya becomes a heroine, Rambabu ignores Yadu. Mallik impressed with the trial shoot, convinces the producer. The producer had suffered much loss due to Idly vishwanath's film. The film shooting begins with Mallik as hero and Sandhya as heroine. At this time, an item dancer Mumaith (Mumaith Khan), who had an affair with Mallik attempts suicide and is raped. This and the paucity of funds puts the project in trouble. Yadu comes forward to finance the project. But once the shooting is over Ravi finds his name missing in the titles. Eventually he teaches Yadu a lesson and replaces the name.
