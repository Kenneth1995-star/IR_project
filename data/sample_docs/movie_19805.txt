You Must Be Joking!

Four British soldiers - Sergeant Major McGregor (complete with kilt and bearskin), Captain Tabasco, father of nine Sergeant Clegg, Sergeant Mansfield - and United States Air Force Lieutenant Morton have their initiative tested in a scavenger hunt, set for them by a British Army psychologist, Major Foskett (Terry-Thomas). They are instructed to obtain six symbols of the British way of life. The reward for the winner is to be fast-tracked for promotion and a ten-day, all-expenses-paid trip around the world for two. Among the feats to be accomplished within 48 hours are escaping from a maze, retrieving a rare rose and the mascot from a Rolls-Royce motorcar, and procurement of a lock of hair and an autograph from a popular French female singer. The final challenge involves the famous Lutine bell from the Underwriting Room of Lloyd's of London.[1][2] Because of complaints in the past, if any of them get into trouble, the authorities will deny everything. They are ordered to wear civilian clothes and leave behind all their money.
