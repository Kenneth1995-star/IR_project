Texasville

In 1984, 33 years after the events depicted in The Last Picture Show, 50-year-old Duane Jackson (Bridges) is a wealthy tycoon of a near-bankrupt oil company. His relationship with his family is not prospering, either. His wife, Karla (Annie Potts), believes that Duane is cheating on her, and his son, Dickie (William McNamara), seems to be following in his father's libidinous footsteps.
Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) works as Duane's secretary, and despondent Lester Marlow (Quaid), now a businessman, seems a prime candidate for a business crisis, a heart attack, or both.
Sonny Crawford's (Bottoms) increasingly erratic behavior causes Duane concern over Sonny's mental health.
Jacy Farrow (Shepherd) has traveled the world and experienced its pleasures. A painful tragedy brings her back to her hometown and once again into Duane's life.
