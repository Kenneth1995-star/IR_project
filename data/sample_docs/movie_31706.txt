Punyavathi

Professor Krishna Rao (S.V.Ranga Rao) is a great educationist. During his youth, he loves a woman named Parvathi (Pandaribai) and gets married to her. The couple has a son Prakash (NTR) and due to some dire circumstances, their family gets separated. After the sincere search for his lost wife and son, Krishna Rao marries another woman Padmavathi (Bhanumathi Ramakrishna) eventually. This couple has two children Shekar (Shobhan Babu) and Chitra (Jyothi Lakshmi). Along with these kids, Krishna Rao adopts friend’s daughter Shanti (Krishnakumari). Padmavathi is an irresponsible woman who neglects family life and goes to clubs and parties. To make things worse, she makes Chitra accustomed to this lifestyle. As a result, Chitra falls for a wrong man Ramesh (Haranath), gets pregnant and commits suicide when she gets cheated. Sekhar gets shattered with his sister’s unfortunate demise and becomes a heavy drunkard in the rice mill he works. He roams around with fellow industry workers in search of affection and love. Meanwhile, Parvathi takes care of her son well and he becomes a lecturer but he grows up with hatred towards his father. Incidentally, Prakash takes guidance from Professor Krishna Rao not being aware that the latter is his father. Prakash even falls for Shanthi who stays in Professor’s house and as time passes by, a great bonding of respect forms between Prakash and Krishna Rao. The saddened parents Krishna Rao and Padmavathi become bedridden with Chitra’s death and with Shanti’s good words, Sekhar comes to the family’s rescue. He unites the family with great difficulty and the film ends happily when Krishna Rao and Padmavathi realize the greatness of Punyavathi- none other than his first wife Parvathi.[6]
