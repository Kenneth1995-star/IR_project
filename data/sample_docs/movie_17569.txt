Dot Goes to Hollywood

Yoram Gross's eighth Dot movie opens in Australia with Dot and a koala named Gumley dancing and singing in the streets. There is evidence of an epidemic, revealed to be an eye disease, which is spreading fast among the koalas, causing blindness and death. Gumley has contracted the disease and he and Dot are trying to raise money to pay for an operation, but they are unsuccessful. A kangaroo suggests that Dot goes to Hollywood where she will be able to raise the money in no time.
In Hollywood Dot meets many famous people and goes to an audition, which she hopes will lead to earning some money. During her audition Gumley is discovered and taken to the zoo. The zoo's vet discovers that Gumley is sick with the disease, but the zoo cannot afford to pay for the operation either.
Gumley is held captive until Dot arrives at the zoo and helps him escape. While hiding in the zoo, Gumley's condition worsens. After Dot wins a contest, the vet agrees to operate on Gumley's eyes. Dot practices her singing while Gumley undergoes surgery. The first operation doesn't go well, but another procedure two days later succeeds in curing Gumley.
Gumley returns to Dot during a performance and they sing together along with other characters.
