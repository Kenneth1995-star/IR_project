The Green Years

"Scotland 1900". Robert Shannon, a young orphan, is sent to live with his Scottish grandparents. His great-grandfather becomes the lad's mentor/father figure, helping him overcome the challenges of youth, and mollifying the cold stinginess of Robert's grandfather. The young Robert suffers life's trials, and the kind, old great-grandfather, despite given to drink and tall tales, is always there to help him rebound. In time, the intelligent Robert grows into a teenager, and comes to love his childhood friend Alison. He proceeds to attend medical college, and attains a career before marrying his sweetheart.
