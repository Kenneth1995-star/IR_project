Spring Reunion

Maggie Brewster (Betty Hutton), once voted the most popular girl in her class, has a successful real estate career, but her one regret is that she never married. When she runs into an old flame at the reunion (Dana Andrews), it looks as if the two might be meant for each other after all. However, his aversion to commitment and her unwillingness to step out of her comfort zone threatens to kill their romance before it even begins.
