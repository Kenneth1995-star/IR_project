Postmaster

Young spirited Nanda Sen leaves his city home of old Calcutta and luxury of urban life to join as the village Postmaster of Plassey where his life was comforted with the service and company of orphan low-caste housemaid Ratna and his only friend there- school teacher Rabibabu. Ratna’s charm appealed to him and Nanda married her against society and family. Succumbed to his father’s last wish to marry a suitable match, Nanda landed in a crisis and escaped his desired family life. Nanda couldn’t overcome this sin and finds solace in the next life.[4]
