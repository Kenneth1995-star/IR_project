Military

Madhavan (Sathyaraj), locally known as Military, is a protective brother of five younger sisters : Ammu, Seetha, Nandhini, Archana, and Kamali. Their father (Manivannan) married again after the death of his first wife and after that his children never speaks with them. In his second marriage, he has two daughters.
The eldest of Madhavan's sister, Ammu was raped by her widower professor (Nizhalgal Ravi). Madhavan asked his sister to marry the professor who was quite old and so the other sisters were unhappy, who did not know about the matter. His second sister, Seetha hence elopes with their uncle's son Balasubramaniam (Livingston) and later comes to stay in their neighbourhood itself. Madhavan's enemies try to kill his brother-in-law and put the blame on Madhavan. Luckily, his brother-in-law survives and tells the truth.
