Karmegam

Karmegham (Mammootty) returns to his village after serving in the army for long. He finds that the villagers still live the shackles of old customs and traditions. They work as slaves to a feudal landlord (Radha Ravi) who exploits them. Maheswari (Abhirami), a doctor, falls in love with Karmegham. Later through his mother (Manorama), Karmegham comes to know that Radha Ravi is his father and then it becomes a father-son conflict. Karmegham stood with the villagers and opposed his father and brother Shakthi. His sister, Mangai, loves a poor villager but Sakthi and his father are against her love. Sakthi kills her sister's lover, his sister goes mad and Karmegham calls the police. His brother escapes but the police shot him in an encounter. Karmegham gets married with Maheswari. His sister and mother die in a bomb blast planned by Karmegham's father. Karmegham kills his father to save at least his village.
