The Voice of the Turtle

A young actress, Sally Middleton, agrees to a date with a soldier, Bill Page, on a weekend pass after he's stood up by Olive Lashbrooke, her friend. When the soldier has trouble getting a hotel room, he ends up spending the weekend at her apartment.
Olive, having at first set her sights on Bill's commanding officer, has second thoughts and makes a play for Bill. He has fallen for Sally, who has sworn off love after her breakup with a theatrical producer, Ken Bartlett, so he sets about changing her mind.
