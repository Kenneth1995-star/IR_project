Shabdavedi

Shabdavedi is about Sandeep (Rajkumar), a strict police officer crusading against narcotics. The man is so straight that when his wife Jaya Prada refuses to reveal the identity of a key link in the drug ring that he is investigating, he beats her in lockup. Eventually he overcomes all the usual attempts to throw him off the chase like tarnishing his reputation and implicating him in lock-up death cases and tracks the ring down to its last man.
