Arjun, Lara Dutta, Raghuvaran

Anandaraj, who argues for rapists and murderers, is killed by a cricket ball hit by Siddharth (Arjun Sarja).
Siddharth is a GM of a five-star hotel owned by S. Ve. Shekher. Shekher’s daughter is Lara (Lara Dutta), who is introduced with a song. She comes from abroad to join her dad’s hotel but only as a trainee under the macho GM. Within no time, Lara is in love with Siddharth.
It’s now time for duets. Lara’s friend Prakash (Karan) is a campaigner of public cause. His efforts lead to a brothel raid and a minister getting arrested. The minister’s goons bump off Prakash and Siddharth is an eyewitness. Siddharth refuses to testify and Lara walks out on him. Charan Raj pleads for the killer and lets him off. Siddharth bumps off Charan Raj. Nassar, a military officer is a witness to the murder. Nassar even postpones his heart operation until the killer is nabbed. Siddharth now tells his story of why he is on a hunt of the lawyers who plead for the bad guys. Nassar gives up his mission.
Next Devan takes a brief for a rapist and he too is killed. Next is the turn of Raghuvaran who comes from Delhi. The surprise element is that Raghuvaran is Siddharth's brother-in-law. Raghuvaran’s wife is Siddharth's long-lost sister. Now the brother-sister sentiment comes into play. Finally the story ends with Raghuvaran being shot dead by Siddharth in the court premises. The police open fire and bystanders form a human wall and get shot at. Siddharth tells the TV crew about how his mission has spread to the masses.
