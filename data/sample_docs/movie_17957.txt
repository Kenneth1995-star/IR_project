Mondol (A.T.M. Shamsuzzaman) is an influential person in the village. His son Milon (Farooque) likes the girl of a street singer (Anwar Hossain) Golapi (Bobita). In the meantime, Mondol brings a bridegroom for Golapi but they demand a cycle. Golapi's father cannot afford this so Milon pay for the cycle. But for some reason the marriage does not take place and Golapi's father commits suicide. As a result, Golapi's family fall into grief and she starts to work in different places by train. The people from the village do not take this positively and sit to desert them to work on trains.
