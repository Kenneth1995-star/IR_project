Agaram

Thiru (Nandha) is a young Airtel employee, who has just moved into the family's new house in Tuticorin, with his sister (Varshini), mother (Seetha), and grandmother (Sukumari). Their happiness is tinged with the grief of Thiru's father's recent death, before the construction could be completed.[4]
Fate decrees that the entire family be placed in jeopardy when Thiru has an argument with Pasupathy, the brother of the dreaded don of the waterfront mafia Varma (Biju Menon) during the local elections.
Varma swears to kill Thiru, agreeing to spare his life for just four days until the election ends, at the request of his politician crony (Ilavarasu), who is all set to become the MLA. The family flees, but is captured and brought back to face the atrocities unleashed by Varma's goons.
