Daal Me Kaala

When Bombay-based Rajaram and Rajendra Kumar are unable to pay their hotel bill, they board a train without buying tickets to flee. When confronted with a ticket-checker, they alight at Bangalore and widower Bishambernath mistakes Rajendra for Professor Roy. The duo accompany the former to his mansion where he lives with his daughter, Manju; widowed sister, and a niece, Sheela. The duo are introduced to the family, settle down and eventually Rajendra and Manju on one hand, and Rajaram and Sheela on the other, fall in love. They are not aware that Professor Roy has also arrived in Bangalore, but is being held against his will by Banke Bihari, who has mistaken him for a singer named Natwar Shyam. It is during the performance that Roy will manage to escape and rather dramatically arrive at Bishambernath's residence - not only exposing the true identities of the duo, but also ending their romance, and possibly getting them arrested on a number of charges.[1]
