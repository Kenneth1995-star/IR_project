Avana Ivan

Kumar (S. Balachandar) kills his wife played by Lakshmirajam Sadan in order to marry another woman, Vaasanthi. The murder is witnessed by two children (Kutty Padmini and Master Sridhar), who go for a picnic along with other children who later expose the truth. At the last the murderer is arrested and taken away by the police; he winks at the children who exposed him and says "tata".
