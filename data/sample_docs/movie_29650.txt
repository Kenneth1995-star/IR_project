Payanangal Mudivathillai

The film showcases the true love of Mohan to Poornima in that he didnt want her or her father (Poornam Vishwanathan) to know about his terminal illness (leukamia/blood cancer at the final stage) and his counting days. With this intent, he was planning to create a gap from Poornima. However, Poornima and her father intrepreted him badly as if he had changed his mentality after becoming rich. They were depressed because he became rich from a pauper stage only because of Poornima and her fathers opportunity to him to give a lot of singing opportunities to him. Poornima and her father realise the real cause of change of Mohan's mind only after Rajesh (the doctor who attends Mohan) tells about his sickness. Rajesh believes that Mohan does not know but Mohan has eavesdropped the report while Rajesh was discussing in his clinic. The story reaches climax with the suicide of Poornima and Mohan in that their journey through music continues even after their worldly life.
