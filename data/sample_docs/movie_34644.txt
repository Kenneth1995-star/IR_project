Venus Talk

Shin-hye (Uhm Jung-hwa) is a capable, successful TV producer, sometimes derided as a "gold miss" for still being single in her forties. Her protege-turned-longtime boyfriend, the current chief of their TV network, just left her for a younger woman who also happens to be Shin-hye's junior colleague.
Shin-hye has two best friends, Mi-yeon (Moon So-ri), a housewife who isn't satisfied with her sex life with her rather docile husband Jae-ho (Lee Sung-min), and Hae-young (Jo Min-su), a soft-hearted, divorced single mother who wants her grown daughter Soo-jung (Jeon Hye-jin) to move out so she can have more time with her widowed boyfriend, carpenter Sung-jae (Lee Geung-young).
Soon, life gets better for the three friends. Shin-hye begins a thrilling relationship with a younger man (Lee Jae-yoon), another TV producer who is 17 years her junior; she tries to keep the relationship casual but can't stop herself from falling for him. Mi-yeon and Jae-ho enjoy a second honeymoon after their daughter leaves to study abroad and he starts taking Viagra. Soo-jung finally gets married upon her unexpected pregnancy and moves out of Hae-young's home. But things take a turn when Hae-young is diagnosed with cancer, and Mi-yeon finds out her husband had an affair.[8][9]
