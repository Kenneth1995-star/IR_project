Pasand Apni Apni

An insane misunderstanding that leads to love. Here, an almost-out-of-work actress - Geeta - accepts a ride from the chauffeur of wealthy industrialist Sandeep Anand. She is seen descending from Sandeep's limo and assumed to be his fiancé, all unbeknownst to herself. As a result, wonderful things begin to happen to her - her theatre company makes her the leading lady of all their productions, she is courted and fêted wherever she goes and a journalist becomes her constant shadow. She finds herself falling for him only to find out that he is none other than Sandeep Anand.
