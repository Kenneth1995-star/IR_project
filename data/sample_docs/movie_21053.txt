The Secret of Moonacre

The film begins with Maria Merryweather after her parents pass away. Her Father leaves her the only thing he has left, "The Ancient Chronicles of Moonacre Valley". The book tells how the Moonacre Valley was cursed by the "Moon Princess", after two families fought over her "Moon Pearls".
Sir Benjamin, Maria’s estranged Uncle, invites her and her governess, Miss Heliotrope, to live in Moonacre Manor.
When she arrives, Sir Benjamin confiscates the book and to stay away from the forest, and the de Noirs, the rival family in Moonacre Valley.
Maria is surprised by the magic in the dilapidated manor: such as food and clothes, which appear out of nowhere; pianos that play themselves; glittering stars on the ceiling; and, a Black Lion and Unicorn, which protect her and the Moon Princess.
Maria and Robin, de Noir’s youngest son, find the Moon Princess’ secret grotto. But, there is little time, if Maria is going to stop the curse, which de Noir’s daughter, admits, she tried before and failed to do herself.
