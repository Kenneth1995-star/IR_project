The Fool

The narrative is grounded in the double life of a humble clerk who poses as the reclusive, but widely respected "Sir John." He thus moves in wealthy upper class circles and participates in grand investment schemes while living in a London slum. The movie's grand-eloquent socialist soliliquaies and detailed evocation of life in Victorian London drew on the vast personal archive of interviews about contemporary London life by Henry Mayhew.
