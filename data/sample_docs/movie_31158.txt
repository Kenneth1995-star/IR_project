Haridas

Sivadas (Kishore) the daring cop who gets ruthless against the local goon Aadhi (Pradeep Rawat) and is just miles away from nabbing the crook. He has a driver named Kundasamy. However he is forced to leave the force for a while to take care of his autistic son, Haridas (Prithviraj Das) because of an unfortunate matter. With much difficulty he enrolls Haridas in a normal school where Amudhavalli (Sneha) is a teacher specialized to deal with special children.
Kishore dwells into the character of Sivadas a sorry father for not sparing time to his family, when it mattered most and tries to understand his son's problem step by step. He understands the fact that Autism is not a disease to brood over, it just needs the extra affection and care rather than feeling sympathetic. Over a period of time the bonding between the teacher and the student blossoms like a bright sunflower. Does the father succeed in lodging a room in his son's imagination, what happens forms the rest of the play.
