Yerra Mandaram

Ramudu (Rajendra Prasad) plays an uneducated and innocent person working in a theatre. Arundhati (Yamuna) loves Ramudu and marries him. Due to reservation system provided by the Government for the post of Panchayat President, Ramudu is elected as the President of Gram panchayat by the village people under the head of a landlord, Jagganna Dora (Devaraj). Jagganna Dora later reveals his intention of selecting Ramudu as president as he is innocent and can be made a puppet in his hands. Ramudu wants to reform his village but is left helpless as he lacks courage. Later one day, he feels ashamed of himself for being so powerless and unable to stop the crimes committed by the Dora. He revolts back which results in his arrest with false accusations and is killed by the Dora's men after he returns from the police station. The police take the Dora's side and close the case reporting that the person killed was someone other than Ramudu. Finally, Dora is then murdered by Arundhati and her son, both of whom allege the murder was committed by Ramudu who is still said to be alive by the police. The movie ends with Arundhati and her son walking free.
