Plus One

Masha (Madeleine Dzhabrailova), an English-Russian translator, accompanies puppeteer Tom (Jethro Skinner) from the UK to Moscow, where he has been hired to conduct master classes with young actors of the puppet theater.
Masha and Tom seem to have very little in common. Masha is very serious about life and what people think about it, whereas Tom perceives the world as a theater play. However, both have lonely lives; Masha loves her dictionaries, and Tom's sole companion is a doll-glove, which he carries with him always. Their mutual isolation from the world draws them together and they fall in love. When it is time to leave, Masha is able to let go of Tom easily, for she now feels ready to start a new life.
