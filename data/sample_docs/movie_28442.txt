London Bridge

Vijay (Prithviraj) is a business man who always listens to his brain, and Pavitra (Andrea) - the daughter of a famous businessman CS Nambiar (Pratap Pothen) - is a girl who always listens to her heart. Vijay was asked to marry Pavitra by her dad and Pavitra is testing whether Vijay is the right guy for her. Driving his way home from spending a day with Pavitra, Vijay hits Merin (Nanditha), a nurse who has just arrived from India to work in London. Her wrist gets paralysed after the accident. Vijay takes care of her and eventually falls in love with Merin and vice versa. Pavitra's dad and Francis (Mukesh) fixes Vijay and Pavitra's marriage. But when he refuses to marry her, Francis forces him to get married to Pavitra because of her wealth. Merin's job agreement gets terminated because they think that she is physically unfit. Francis tries to help her but he fails. Eventually, Francis forces Vijay to not give her false hopes and gift her a sum of money and let her go back to India. Merin refuses the amount of money gifted and asks him to show her around London before she leaves. Then Merin goes back to India. The next day, her aunt Gracy (Lena) calls Vijay to tell that Merin has not reached her home yet. Gracy's husband Thai Kutty (Sunil), tells them that he will go to India to enquire about Merin but Vijay says that he will go instead because he is the one who is supposed to go. Francis tries to force him to stay, but Vijay says that he really likes Merin and he will go to India, no matter what. Pavitra helps him to go to India by convincing her dad to not stop him and personally dropping him at the airport. Vijay reaches India. While in a taxi, Francis calls Vijay and directs him to go to Merin's home. Vijay reaches Merin's home to find her house being seized to debt. He finds out that Merin has reached home safely. The movie ends by Pavitra revealing to Vijay that Merin had reached home safely, but lied to make Vijay realize his love for her.
