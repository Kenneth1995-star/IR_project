Srikanth, Sneha, Kalabhavan Mani

Bose (Srikanth), the eponymous hero, is a commando in the Army. When Kottaiperumal (Kalabhavan Mani), a Union Minister, is kidnapped by terrorists, Bose goes on a daring rescue operation and manages to pull it off, and that is enough for Kottaiperumal to have him as his personal security guard.
Up close with Kottaiperumal, Bose gets to know his other real side. When Kottaiperumal tries to misbehave with a college girl Charulatha (Sneha) in Delhi, Bose rises up in anger. In trying to save her, he ends up shooting Kottaiperumal. Though he escapes with some injuries, Kottaiperumal gets Bose sacked from the Army. Distraught and disconsolate, Bose lands in Chennai and meets Charulatha, who is a student in Kalashektra. Upon meeting her, the duo the natural thing - fall in love.
However, they have the villain's goons on their track. Kottaiperumal is waiting for revenge. After some fights, Kottaiperumal's men bump off Bose's father (Manikka Vinayagam) and kidnap his family members and Charulatha. By then, Bose also stumbles upon the links of Kottaiperumal with terrorist outfits (the first kidnapping itself was a stage-managed one to win voters' sympathy), so he goes on a fight to finish.
Finally, all is well, and Bose is also reinstated in the Army.
