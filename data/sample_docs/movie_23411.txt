Dr. Wai in "The Scripture with No Words"

A pulp serial author with numerous personal problems resulting in a serious case of writer's block, temporarily escapes reality by living vicariously through one of his lead characters in a story about a quest for a mythical scripture. This story within a story has Jet Li up against an enormous mutant rat, Japanese sumo wrestlers and ninjas, although the pen is mightier than the sword (or metal grill, as it were) in this film by famed director Ching Siu-tung.(Note the beginning description of the plot given here seems to be different from the English dubbed version).
