Hind Kesari

King Mansingh (Tarapore) falls prey to the machinations of his minister Zalim Singh and loses his throne. Prince Randhir leading an easy life now disguises himself wearing a mask and turns into the dreaded Hind Kesari. He is assisted in his endeavour to help the needy by Princess Hansa (Husn Bano).
