Sarvadikari

An ambitious minister (Mahavarman) with designs to topple the puppet king (Pulimoottai Ramaswami) of Manipuri finds the popularity of the commander-in-chief (Ugrasenar) and his bodyguard (Pratapan) a stumbling block. He sends a young woman (Meena Devi) to seduce Pratapan, but she falls in love with him. After several twists and turns, Mahavarman is exposed and felled in an exciting duel with Pratapan. Ugrasenar is chosen as the first president while Pratapan is appointed as the new commander in chief. The kingdom of Manipuri is now a republic!
