Soul Survivor

Tyrone Taylor (Peter Williams) is a Jamaican-Canadian immigrant, living in Toronto and working as a hairdresser at a local salon. He doesn't enjoy working at the salon and is looking for ways to easy money, in order to quit his job. He starts collecting debts for Winston Price (George Harris), a local gangster and owner of a nearby nightclub. Though Tyrone's new job under Price is violent and illegal, he tries to rationalize it by talking himself into the belief that he will soon have enough money to quit and go into a cleaner business. His jobs become more and more violent and one day he is forced to collect money from his cousin Reuben (David Smith), who will not pay back. Tyrone takes his side and guarantees his ability to pay to Price. Tyrone's girlfriend Annie (Judith Scott) and his family, who soon find out about Tyrone's new employment, try talking him out the job, warning him of all the dangers that come with it. Tyrone however, continues, believing he is too careful to get caught.
