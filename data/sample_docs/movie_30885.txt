Thiruvannamalai

Easwaran (Arjun Sarja) is upright and honest youth, who runs a local cable channel in Kumbakonam. He is known to fight for causes of the society and the common man. He enters into fisticuffs with local MLA (Sai Kumar) after he exposes his corrupt and greedy ways through his cable TV channel. Fearing trouble, his mother takes him to a saint in Thiruvannamalai. The Swami resembles Easwaran. A sequence of events forces them to swap places. The soft-spoken Swami tries to sort all issues through non-violent means (Gandhian philosophy). Halfway through Karunas dies in the hand of (Vidharth) and the corrupt MLA. In the climax Easwaran kills the MLA.
