Agni Paarvai

Raja (Su. Thirunavukkarasar) is an honest police inspector who is transferred in a new department. In his new area, MLA Inbasekharan (Nizhalgal Ravi) controls everything and cannot hesitate to kill those who face him. First, Inbasekhar tries to corrupt Raja but he refuses. In the meantime, Sundar (Ramkumar) and the minister's daughter Shanthi (Anju) fall in love with each other. Later, Shanthi takes revenge on the poor man Sundar because he won the college first prize. Sundar is expelled from the college and he becomes an auto-driver. Shanthi develops a soft corner for Sundar while Inbasekharan wants to get married with her. Thereafter, Inbasekharan's brother kills Raja's sister. Thus, Raja challenges Inbasekharan to punish him. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
