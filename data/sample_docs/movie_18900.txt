School for Randle

Former Music-Hall act 'Flatfoot' Mason (Frank Randle) is caretaker at a school where one of the pupils, and unbeknownst to her, is his daughter, Betty (Terry Randall); who was put up for adoption when his wife died. She is now a teenager and this causes concern, as the staff feel 'Flatfoot' is being over attentive to her. Told to pay her less attention, 'Flatfoot' reluctantly obeys, but Betty thinks he's rejecting her and decides to run away to make her name in show-business. Along with fellow caretakers (Dan Young and Alec Pleon), 'Flatfoot' tracks her down to a seedy cabaret club. In disguise as a Chinese acrobatic troupe, "The Three Who Flungs", 'Flatfoot' and friends attempt to persuade Betty to come home.
