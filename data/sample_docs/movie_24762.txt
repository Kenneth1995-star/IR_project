Chetna

In this film, actor Anil Dhawan (elder brother of director David Dhawan) plays the role of a shy and reclusive young man by the name of Anil, who gets introduced to a beautiful prostitute named Seema (Rehana Sultana) through his friend, Ramesh (Shatrughan Sinha). Anil and Seema become good friends through their increasing patience, acceptance, and understanding of each other's ways. They eventually fall in love.
One day, Anil proposes to Seema, and although Seema is happy about this, she's very reluctant in taking the decision to proceed with him because she's not sure whether she can lead a normal life after marriage. Still, she accepts the proposal, and Anil offers her to stay with him for some time before she marries him. Seema becomes convinced that Anil truly loves her, and that she can actually lead a normal life with him. She starts to plan for her marriage, and, during that time, a matter comes up in which Anil has to go out of town for a few days.
When he returns, he returns to an unrecognizable Seema. Seema takes up drinking, smoking, and develops a very nonchalant and distant attitude towards him. He wonders what might have happened to her during his absence. Unbeknownst to him, Seema comes to know that she's pregnant and she doesn't know who the father is. Not wanting Anil to be ridiculed and cursed by society, she consumes poison.
Major comeback in Indian cinema and exotic scenes.
