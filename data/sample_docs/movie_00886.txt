Anna Christie

Anna Christie is the story of a former prostitute who falls in love, but runs into difficulty in turning her life around.
The first act takes place in a bar owned by Johnny the Priest and tended by Larry. Coal-barge captain Old Chris receives a letter from his daughter, a young woman he has not seen since he lived in Sweden with his family and she was five years old. They meet at the bar and she agrees to go to the coal barge with him.
The barge crew rescues Mat Burke and four other men who survived a shipwreck in an open boat. Anna and Mat donâ€™t get along at first, but quickly fall in love.
A confrontation on the barge among Anna, Chris and Mat. Mat wants to marry Anna, Chris does not want her to marry a sailor, and Anna doesn't want either of them to think they can control her. She tells them the truth about her past: she was raped while living with her mother's relatives on a Minnesota farm, then worked briefly as a nurse's aide before becoming a prostitute. Mat reacts angrily. He and Chris leave.
Mat and Chris return. Anna forgives Chris for not being part of her childhood. After a dramatic confrontation, Anna promises to abandon prostitution and Mat forgives her. Chris agrees to their marriage. Chris and Mat have both signed to work aboard a ship that is leaving for South Africa the next day. They promise to return to Anna after the voyage.
