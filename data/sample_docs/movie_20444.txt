Underworld

Dr. Savary (Elliott), a sinister biochemist, has created a subhuman species that dwells in London's underground. Addicted to Savary's mind-expanding drug, his creations suffer from grotesque disfigurements. The victims' only hope for an antidote lies in kidnapping Nicole (Cowper), a high-class prostitute. Roy Bain (Lamb), a fearless adventurer and Nicole's former lover, is hired to save her.
