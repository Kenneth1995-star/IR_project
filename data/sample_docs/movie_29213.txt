Adutha Veettu Penn

A simple man (Ramachandran) falls in love with his neighbour Leela (Anjali Devi), who sings and dances well. He wants to impress her by singing, but he cannot sing. So he seeks the help of his friend, a singer (Thangavelu) who agrees to help. While Thangavelu sings in the background, Ramachandran just lip-syncs. Leela is charmed by what she thinks is Ramachandran singing and falls in love with him. Soon the truth comes out, and the rest of the film deals with how the tangle between the lovers is solved.
