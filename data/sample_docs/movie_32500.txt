Money Money, More Money

Four small-time crooks, Chakri (J. D. Chakravarthy), Raghu (Bramhaji), Abbas (Mukul Dev) and Gogineni Gangaraju aka Goga (Kevin Dave) turn towards kidnapping for some quick money. They kidnap Megahana (Tara Alisha), daughter of a millionaire Jagadish (Nagababu) and they demand money (1 crore). They are forced to barge into the home of a vegetarian family of 35. The head of the household is Khan Dada (Bramhanandam), a ex-don and rival of Chakri.
Their stay in the house gets extended when they learn than Jagadish has gone abroad and they have to wait until he returns. The kidnappers are forced to take more hostages to keep their identity secret and prevent the kidnapping venture from failing. Eventually other people are stuck in the house, such as: Shankarabharanam (Venu Madhav), a pizza guy, Bullabbai (Rajeev Kanakala),a police constable, Trisha (Gajala), a sales girl, Tirumala Shetty (guy who wants money from Khan Dada), etc.
Jagadish finally appears he gives the four kidnappers the money, however there is now a fight between the four, and then Jagadish calls the police. The kidnappers go to Police station, Jagadish and Meghana say Chakri, Goga and Raghu are innocent but not Abbas. After 16 months Chakri owns a hotel and works with Shankarabharanam. Meghana and Chakri are both friends, Trisha works with Raghu on the sales business, Goga owns a sweet shop, Bullabbai is not a constable but a S.I., Abbas goes to jail, and the Khan residence live happily ever after and Khan and Chakri become good friends.
