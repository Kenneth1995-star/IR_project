Money Movers

An armoured payroll truck owned by Darcy's Security Services is robbed and the driver, ex-policeman Dick Martin, is removed from armoured cars and put onto night patrols. The robbers are double crossed by crime boss Jack Henderson whose henchman Dino kills all the robbers.
Lionel Darcy, head of the company, suspects a major robbery is being planned but is unaware that all the culprits are employed by the company. He asks former employee Mindel Seagers to look into newcomer to the firm, Leo Bassett. Jack Henderson discovers that a robbery is being planned by Eric Jackson, a former speedway driver and a Senior Supervisor with Darcy's, his brother Brian Jackson who also works as a guard for Darcy's as an armoured truck driver, and Ed Gallagher, the supervisor of Darcy's counting house. When Eric Jackson breaks into Bassett's apartment, Henderson's men kidnap him and cut off the little toe on his left foot with a pair of bolt cutters in their attempt to force him to work for him.
Dick Martin and Leo Bassett foil the planned robbery after which Martin is taken to hospital suffering gun shot wounds while Bassett reveals to Lionel Darcy (who was found out through Seagers to be working undercover as a guard on behalf of Darcy's insurance company Legal & United) that it was he who has sent a threatening note warning that robbery of Darcy's money counting house was to be the ruse used to flush out any real robbers.
