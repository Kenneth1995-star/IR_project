R. Sattanathan (Major Sundarrajan) a leading criminal lawyer and Bangalore Ramaswamy (V. K. Ramasamy), Sattanathan's professional competitor were once friends but now foes. Sattanathan has vowed that he will win a case against Ramaswamy at least once in his lifetime, for which he even makes his son Saravanan (Sivaji Ganesan) study law, so that if not him at least his son will defeat Ramaswamy. But contrary to Sattanathan's expectation Saravanan falls in love with Ramaswamy's daughter Devi (Manjula). Helping them in their love is Ramesh (Nagesh) Ramaswamy's nephew. A lot of hilarious incidents and confusions follow before the lovers are united.
