Vaimaye Vellum

Perumal (Rajan P. Dev), a police officer, is transferred to the same area as 20 years ago.
In the past, Perumal's wife died during her delivery and Perumal felt that the baby brought bad luck, Perumal later got married Saraswathi (Vennira Aadai Nirmala). Although being a clever student, Raja was hated by his father while his stepmother Saraswathi took care of him like her own son. Later, Perumal sent his innocent son to the jail.
Raja (Parthiban) is now a rickshaw man and also a rowdy who cannot tolerate the injustice so he often goes to jail. Maari (Jojan), a rich industrialist, and his henchman Kaasi (Majid) kidnap the children of rich businessmen and ransom them. A journalist is determined to stop this and hires Raja for protecting his daughter Meena (Rachana Banerjee) from Alex's henchmen. Soon, Raja clashes with Maari, Kaasi and his father Perumal.
