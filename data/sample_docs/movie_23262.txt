News Attack

Rich heir Yeung Ka-chung (Wilson Lam) is a newcomer reporter. After several incidents including one saving a girl from jumping down a building, he develops great respect towards his colleagues, veteran Chui Kit (Michael Miu) and daredevil reporter Turbo (Andy Lau), admiring their sense of justice, competence, courageousness and cleverness. The two become Ka-chung's mentors and friends.
Led by Kit, the trio worked together to uncover ugly behavior of powerful tycoon Joseph Pong (Wong Kam-kong), which include forcing his mistress (Cally Kwong) to abortion which led to her suicide. Angered of the shame it caused him, Pong sends his underling to beat up Kit and led him to unemployment.
Turbo and Ka-chung both support Kit and they continue to work together to gather evidence of Pong's bribery crimes, and after many hardship, they finally hand the evidence to the police and bring Pong to justice.
