Shagoon

While on a trip to Nainital, Geeta (Waheeda Rehman) meets Madan (Kamaljit) and falls in love with him. Madan is from Delhi and his father is a wealthy man. His mother played by Achla Sachdev is a superstitious woman who constantly gets poojas performed by pandits. Madan expresses his desire to get married to Geeta and his parents agree to his request. But the family pandit studies Geeta's horoscope and reveals that she is a manglik and hence inauspicious. Being a manglik or having Mangal Dosha is considered unfortunate as per Indian astrology.
