Bharya Bhartalu

Anand (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), son of a Public Prosecutor Dharma Rao (Gummadi) leads an exorbitant and Casanova-like lifestyle. Sharada (Krishna Kumari) is a beautiful school teacher daughter of a lawyer’s clerk Sivakamaiah (Ramana Reddy). Anand likes her, but she refuses his affection. She is compelled to get married to him by her parents. She initially dislikes him, but subsequently, starts loving him after he changes himself into a righteous human being, out of affection towards Sharada. As things are getting better between them, Anand's ex-girlfriend the playgirl Hemalatha (Girija) reappears and tries to blackmail him. She invites him to her house. While returning from her house, Anjaneyulu (Padmanabham) whom Hemalatha ‘married on paper,’ kills her for cheating on him. Anand is implicated in the murder. Lawyer Ramanandam (Relangi) elder brother defends him. To elicit the truth from Anjaneyulu, Ramanandam, Sarada and Sivakamaiah’s father-in-law Kutumbaiah (Chadalavada) enact a ‘mask’ drama. Anjaneyulu confesses to the crime. Anand is absolved. Finally, the wife & husband reunite happily.
