Mickey Virus

When two Hackers are murdered in Delhi, Delhi Police suspect that case revolves around hacking, they begin their search to find a computer hacker who can help them crack this case. The head of the police team ACP Siddhanth (Manish Choudhary) accompanied by Inspector Bhalla (Varun Badola), stumbles across Mickey Arora (Manish Paul), a lazy but smart hacker who runs a grocery store in day time and creates viruses for anti virus companies in the night along with his friends tomboy Chutney (Puja Gupta), Floppy, Pancho and Professor (Nitesh Pandey) who always helps him out in all odd jobs. ACP Siddhanth hires him to hack down the website of a group of cyber criminals known as Bhram Gang. Meanwhile, Mickey falls in love with Kamayani (Elli Avram) an employee of Excalibur Securities. One day in her office Kamayani wrongly transferred a big amount from a client's account but to avoid her from being fired Mickey hacks the company's website to reverse the transaction. Only the next morning Micky came to know that he has unknowingly stolen 100 crore rupees from a Dubai based don and Kamayani has been murdered. Scared of being framed for both the crimes Mickey seeks help from his friends. In the quest to search for the real culprit Mickey traced down 100 crore rupees and finds out that ACP Siddhanth is the master mind who forced Kamayani to bluff him. Mickey calls ACP and his friends to the parking lot of Nehru Place where ACP tells him that his friends Floppy, Pancho and Professor are Bhram Gang and want to kill him for the money as they did to the two hackers and Kamayani. Surrounded by all the goons Mickey records and telecasts their confession on YouTube and in the end Inspector Bhalla along with police force arrests them all and leaves Mickey to get information about money from him and credit rolls to show few deleted scenes and audio message of Anwar Raja.
