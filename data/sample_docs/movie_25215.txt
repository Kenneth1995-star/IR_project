Nadiya Ke Paar

The story is based on the first half of a Hindi novel, Kohbar Ki Shart, by Keshav Prasad Mishra. A Brahman farmer from Eastern Uttar Pradesh lives with his two nephews. He falls ill and is treated by a Vaidya (indigenous medical practitioner) from another village. When the farmer feels okay, he asks the Vaidya about his fees. The Vaidya asks for the farmer's eldest nephew to marry his eldest daughter. The farmer readily agrees.
Omkar (Inder Thakur) marries the Vaidya's elder daughter Roopa (Mitali), and they start living happily. Roopa gives birth to a baby. During Roopa's pregnancy, her younger sister Gunja (Sadhana Singh) comes to live with her. While there, she falls in love with Omkar's younger brother Chandan (Sachin).
Learning of their love, Roopa promises to help them marry. But, she dies in an accident; and nobody else knows about the love affair. The farmer and the Vaidya decide that Gunja should marry the widower Omkar, to take care of her sister's baby. But moments before the wedding rituals are completed, Chandan and Gunja's love affair is revealed. He is allowed to marry Gunja with everyone's consent.
The rural culture and languages of Uttar Pradesh are portrayed authentically in the film. The movie is based on the first half of the novel. It changes the partners in the second marriage, as the novel had the proposed marriage between Gunja and Omkar taking place. The novel proceeded with the development of their relationship, where Omkar dies of illness and eventually Gunja also dies leaving Chandan alone.
Most of the film was shot at Kerakat Jaunpur And ChaubeypurVaranasi in eastern U.P.
