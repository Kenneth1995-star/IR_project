Man of Iron

Steel mill foreman Chris Bennett is pleased when he is chosen to be the new boss of Harrison Balding's entire business over Ed Tanahill, who is the owner's cousin. Tanahill and secretary Vida conspire to sabotage Chris's progress at the mill reputation with the men.
The hard-working and popular Chris now neglects the mill and incurs the wrath of his workers while wife Bessie rues the absence of their old friends. He finally comes to his senses and returns to his old position as foreman before it's too late.
