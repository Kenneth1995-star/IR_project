Good Men, Good Women

The film depicts the real-life story of Chiang Bi-Yu (Annie Shizuka Inoh). In the 1940s, she and her newlywed husband, Chung Hao-Tung (Giong Lim), head to mainland China to join the anti-Japanese resistance. During the war, she is forced to give her baby up for adoption. After the war they return to Taiwan, as Chung is to distribute a communist paper called The Enlightenment. However, as the Korean War deepens, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime intensifies the White Terror and Chung is eventually executed.
The film consists of three intermingling storylines and scattered throughout the film are interludes of an actress (also played by Inoh) who prepares for the role of Chiang Bi-Yu, and also confronts her deceased boyfriend's past.
