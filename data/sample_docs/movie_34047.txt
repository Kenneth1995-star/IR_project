Bravo 5

In 1989, the Communist Party is planning to dominate the strategic position of the central region. Five members of the Army Special Forces have been ordered to prevent this from happening. Lieutenant Azri (Remy Ishak), newly married to Aida (Siti Saleha), is named the leader of the four other members, Trooper Karim (Beto Kusyairy), Corporal Morgan ( Sashi Tharan), Corporal Ah Chia (Xafier Fong) and Sergeant Unya (Frank Petterson).
The film follows the troop as they each face and then put aside their personal issues to focus on the mission, defend their village and their loved ones, and return safely.
