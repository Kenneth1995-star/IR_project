Yuvaraja

Raju alias Yuvaraja (Shivanna) is the youngest son of a family and a careless guy, always going around girls and enjoying with them. His womanizing habits are a source of heartburn for his father (Srinath). However, his elder brother Vetri (Balaraj) is a kickboxer and his father's favourite son, who is very fond of him. Janu (Bhavna Pani), Yuvaraja's neighbour, is in love with him, but it is just one sided as Raju considers her a good friend and a source of money and cars to impress girls (Janu's father is a garage owner). He falls in love with Mamathi (Lisa Ray), a rich girl, and poses as a rich guy to impress her. However, she soon finds out that Raju has lied to her. Mamathi dumps Yuvaraja and insults him in front of his father. Raju's father, tired of his son's antics, disowns him. Later Vetri is attacked by his enemies and is bedridden, unable to take part in the kickboxing championship. Raju decides to fight for his brother and to redeem himself in his father's eyes by fighting in the championship match against Rohith (Kumar Govind), who happens to be Mamathi's new boyfriend and the leader of the goons who beat Vetri earlier. Deciding to seek revenge for his brother's accident and to prove himself to his father, Yuvaraja defeats Rohith, redeems himself in front of his father's eyes and finally accepts Janu's love. Hence the film ends with a happy ending and everyone greet Raju as Yuvaraja.
