Mr. Brahmachari

Ananthan Thampy (Mohanlal) is a middle aged man who has decided never to marry in his life. He thinks he will lose all his youthfulness and manly looks by marriage. His main hobby is body building and physique maintaining. Ananthan Thampy prefers to be a chronic bachelor and hence the title Mr. Brahmachari. Ananthan Thampi is known among his friends as Thampi annan. The two ever-loyal assistants Rajappan and Varadappan support him and his ideals, though secretly in their hearts, they plan to marry their sweethearts.
His father Shekharan Thampy (Nedumudi Venu) and mother Subhadramma (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) are eagerly waiting for the day when their son would re-think and change his stand one day, and always give offerings in temples for that. Ananthan Thampy's sister Nirmala (Bindu Panicker) and her husband Venugopalan Thampi (Jagathy), popularly called VVT, are happy about thampy's decision, since they have an eye on the huge properties of Thampi.[3]
The beautiful Ganga(Meena) and family comes to stay in neighborhood of Thampi. Shekharan Thampy rents out a house owned by him to an elderly lady-teacher Vasumathi, who reaches there on transfer. She has four daughters. Eldest one, Sindhu is already married while the other three, namely, Ganga, Yamuna and Kaveri, live with their mother. The local workers doesn't allow Ganga's family to unload their furnitures and other stuff from the lorry. On the demand of Thampy's sister, he had to even carry all the furniture of Ganga's family all by himself to keep the pride of his sister.
One day a guy, Aravindan (VijayKumar) comes and pleads with Thampi for a job in his cable company. Thampi mistakes Aravindan to be Ganga's lover and promises him to help him marry her.
Confusions arises and Thampy had to marry Ganga.
