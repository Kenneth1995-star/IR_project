Kanyashulkam

Girisam (NTR) the cunning bluff master lives at the expense of Putakoollamma (Chayadevi) who runs a mess. He befriends a wench Madhuravani (Savitri). To escape from debts, he accompanies Venkatesam (Master Kundu) to whom he teaches English, to his village. There he tries to woo Venkatesam’s widowed sister Buchamma (Janaki). Venkatesam’s father Agnihotravadhanlu (Vinnakota Ramannapanthulu) despite pleas from his wife Venkamma (Hemalatha) agrees to perform the marriage of his nine-year-old daughter Subbamma (Baby Subhadra) to the rich old man Lubdhavadhanlu (Govindarajula Subbarao) for a bride price negotiated by Ramappa Panthulu (CSR) a paramour of Madhuravani.
To thwart the marriage, Karataka Sastry (Vangara), a stage actor and brother-in-law of Agnihotravadhanlu dons his disciple Mahesam (Master Sudhakar) in a girl’s attire and lures Ramappa Panthulu with a huge sum to cancel the earlier proposal and marry his ‘daughter’ (Mahesam in disguise) to Lubdhavadhanlu. With the help of Madhuravani, the so-called marriage is performed. Lubdhavadhanlu later learns the truth and also a lesson. Meanwhile, Girisam elopes with Buchamma to Vizag and seeks the help of lawyer and social reformer Soujanya Rao (Gummadi). All the characters shift to Vizag. Madhuravani narrates the entire drama to Soujanyarao. He lauds Madhuravani and chides Girisam. Girisam and Buchamma are married.
