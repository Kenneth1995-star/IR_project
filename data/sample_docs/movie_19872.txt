How I Won the War

Lieutenant Goodbody, is an inept, idealistic, na√Øve, and almost relentlessly jingoistic wartime-commissioned (not regular) officer. One of the main subversive themes in the film is the platoon's repeated attempts or temptations to kill or otherwise rid themselves of their complete liability of a commander. While Goodbody's ineptitude and attempts at derring-do lead to the gradual demise of the unit, he himself survives, together with the unit's persistent deserter and another of his charges who ends up confined to psychiatric care. Every time a character is killed he is replaced by an actor in bright red, blue, or green-coloured World War II uniform, whose face is also coloured and obscured so that he appears to be a living toy soldier. This reinforces Goodbody's repeated comparisons of war to playing a game.
