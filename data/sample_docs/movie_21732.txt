Ida Makes a Movie

The National Film Board of Canada is sponsoring a movie festival. Ida Lucas is a nine-year-old girl who decides to make a movie about the environment (specifically garbage), and enter it into the festival. The judges, thinking the film is about war, accept Ida's film into the festival finals.
