Isi Ka Naam Zindagi

Isi Ka Naam Zindagi is a romantic family story set during the British Raj.
Bansiram (Pran) has owned and maintained a plot of land donated to him by a kind village aristocrat (Shakti Kapoor). After the aristocrat dies, his amoral son praises the enviable plot and wants it. Bansiram refuses to sell, and the son is determined to get it. Bansiram appeals to the British for protection, which they provide, and he is able to save his property.
Soon the son passes away; his look-alike son, Devraj, comes to manage the estate. Devraj does not consider Bansiram's land a priority, and years go by. The aristocrat's soul wanders and waits in anguish and pain. When Devraj goes to see Bansiram, he finds an elderly semi-senile man and his grandson, Chotu (Aamir Khan), who wants to produce alcohol on the land. Devraj takes advantage of the situation with unpredictable results.
