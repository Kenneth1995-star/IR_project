The Fairy Tale Killer

When a bloodied and incoherent Wu Zaijun (Wang Baoqiang) confesses to five murders that have not occurred, the police assume that he's mentally unstable and ignore his claims. Police detective Wong Wai-han (Sean Lau) is investigating a series of gruesome murders, but soon discovers that all is not as it seems and that not only are the murders connected, but that Jun is tied to them in some way.
