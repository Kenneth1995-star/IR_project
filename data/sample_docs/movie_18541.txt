21 Days

Larry Durrant (Laurence Olivier) is a bit of a disappointment to his family, and even more so when he kills Henry Wallen (Esme Percy), the disreputable foreign husband of his lover Wanda (Vivien Leigh). The long-missing Henry shows up on Wanda’s doorstep and threatens to kill her. Larry accidentally kills him in the ensuing fight.
Larry stows Henry’s corpse away in an abandoned archway at Glove Lane. Afterwards he goes to his do-good brother Keith (Leslie Banks) for some advice. Keith is a successful attorney with a brilliant mind, well on his way to becoming a judge. When Larry tells him what he has done, Keith wants him to leave the country for a while, and spare them both some trouble, not spoiling Keith’s career by having a murderer for a brother and saving Larry from going to jail.
However, Larry refuses to leave, and returns to the alley where he left the body. There he encounters John Evan (Hay Petrie), a former minister turned bum. Evan unfortunately picks up the gloves Larry had dropped in the street, which results in him later being arrested for Wallen's murder. The police claims there is enough circumstantial evidence with the bloody gloves he had on him.
When Larry learns of Evan's arrest, he considers himself a free man and decides to marry Wanda. For the next three weeks before Evan goes on trial, they plan to squeeze 30 years of idyllic life because Larry will then turn himself in for murder. On the day that Evan is sentenced to hang, Keith begs his brother to remain silent and let the condemned man die. Larry, set on doing the right for once in his life, refuses and leaves for the police station, only to be stopped on the steps by Wanda. She has read the newspaper, telling of Evan’s demise from a heart attack on his way to jail.
