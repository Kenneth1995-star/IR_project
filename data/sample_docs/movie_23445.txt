Fascination Amour

Albert Lai (Andy Lau) is the only child of Hong Kong's richest tycoon. Albert brings Kathy (Qu Ying), a waitress introduced to him by his mother (Susan Tse), onto a cruise ship, where on the first date night, he receives the approval of Kathy and gets engaged. This is already Albert's eighth engagement since love always comes and goes very quick for him, and he would always break an engagement whenever he loses the feeling of novelty in each relationship.
Albert becomes increasingly fond of Kathy's ability to cope decently. It turns out Kathy has been secretly struggling to study the topic of the second day of the cruise, making her feel extremely exhausted. At this time, Kathy meets Timothy (Huang Lei), a waiter on the ship, who came from a same background as her. Kathy feels unrestrained while being with Timothy, and thus, her heart starts to shift.
However, Albert is unwilling to give up and he is confident that he will be able to win Kathy back with his charm. At this time, Sandy (Hikari Ishida) appears around Timothy and she views Albert as an enemy. Compared to Albert, Sandy is far more acerbic and a much bigger spender. However, Albert gradually discovers that while Sandy is not bickering with him, he feels empty and lonely, a feeling that he has never had. Before, nobody had dared to point out Albert's shortcomings, only Sandy dared to point them out publicly. As he comes in contact with Sandy more, he becomes attracted to her personality.
While the ship is to dock and Albert wants to express his feelings, he discovers police officers on shore waiting for Sandy. It turns out that Sandy is bankrupt and this will be her last journey. Whether or not Kathy and Timothy can be together, or whether Albert is able to reverse the adverse and win Sandy's heart, there will always be an end on a wandering life on a ship when it goes to shore.
