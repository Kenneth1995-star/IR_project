Upkar

Manoj Kumar played a village man "Bharat", who sacrifices everything to get his brother educated. His brother Puran (Prem Chopra) goes abroad and comes back a selfish man wanting his share of the property. But when India starts a war with Pakistan, Bharat decides to enlist and head to the border; while his selfish brother, with the help of his greedy uncle, Charandas (Madan Puri) and some partners, try to gain profit by selling drugs and black marketeering in the market. In the end, Bharat returns as a demoralized soldier and his brother repents as he is caught by the police (by the brother-in-law of Bharat). Hence, he vows to be a good and hardworking brother just like his Indo-Pak war veteran brother Bharat.
The movie also stars Asha Parekh as a doctor promoting family planning, Kamini Kaushal and Pran in his first positive character role. Madan Puri played the main villain with ease, full ability, and command. The film won several major awards.
Many years later, Manoj Kumar said that one of the most beautiful screen images that stuck in his mind was a "half-lit Asha Parekh" in this film.[2]
