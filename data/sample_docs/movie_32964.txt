Three Resurrected Drunkards

Three young men go to the beach. Someone steals their clothes while they swim, and replaces them with ones that then leave the three mistaken for illegal aliens. In a commentary on the way Korean immigrants are treated in Japan, the three must then flee from the authorities, who are presented in a ridiculing light.[4]
