Eby Mathew was engaged to Sara, who falls prey to one of the most brutal cases of rape and subsequent homicide. The fate of Sara would have been different, if the other passengers of the same train were not so ignorant to the glimpses of the unusual. They also prevent Ravi Pillai, a fellow passenger (and a friend of Eby, although he doesn't know that Sara was the victim), from responding.
Grief-stricken Eby feels the passengers are as guilty as the criminal, although they are not culprits in the eyes of the law. With the help of Ravi Pillai, he kidnaps each of them for seeking revenge, but finally lets them go when they regret their misdeed.
