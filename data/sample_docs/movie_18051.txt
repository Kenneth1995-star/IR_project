The Tavern Knight

As summarized in a film publication,[4] The Tavern Knight (Norwood), known for his handling of his sword, is really Roland Marleigh, lord of Marleigh Castle. Gregory Ashburn (Croker-King) and his brother Joseph (Humphreys) long ago had caused the death of the Knight's wife and taken his young son, now known as their ward Kenneth (Anderson). Cynthia (Stuart), a niece, was also a member of the household, and the Knight believes that she loves Kenneth. The forces of Charles Stuart (Wickers) and Oliver Cromwell (Conway) are about to fight with The Tavern Knight leading the Stuart forces. Kenneth, fighting for the King, was under the Knight's leadership. When Stuart's forces retreated, the Knight and Kenneth are captured but later escape. The Knight learns that Kenneth is of the house of Marleigh, now in the possession of the Ashburns. Kenneth takes the Knight to Marleigh Castle, where the Knight reveals his identity and a sword fight begins. One of the Ashburns escapes with his life when he promises to tell the Knight news of his son. Complications follow, and the Knight kills Kenneth, which leaves the Knight free to acknowledge his love for Cynthia, who also loves him.
