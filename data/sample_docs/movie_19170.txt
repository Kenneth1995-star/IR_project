Joanna Dane (Maureen O'Hara) is sent to Tangiers to get information on, and close down, an international smuggling ring. Dane is adept at jiu jitsu, firearms, and wisecracks that she uses on anyone who tangles with her. Her beauty, attractive outfits and skill with playing cards get her a position as a croupier at a smuggler's hangout called Frisco's, run by the hard blonde Frisco (Binnie Barnes). Joanna also is pursued by smuggler Van Logan (MacDonald Carey), who she uses by having him take her to Ali Baba's, a parfumerie run by the suspicious Mustapha (Ferdy Mayne).
During her work at Frisco's, Joanna is pestered by Danny Boy (James Lilburn), Logan's Irish assistant, who ignores her insults and warnings to let her alone. When the embarrassed Danny Boy threatens Joanna, she grabs him and throws him to the floor. Augie (Harry Lane) – another target of Joanna's surveillance—beats Danny Boy's head with his cane, knocking him unconsciuous. Logan fights with Augie, revealing he carries a sword cane by tossing the blade at Logan.
Joanna accompanies Logan, Danny Boy and his crew on their boat the Banshee to smuggle goods into Spain where they are hijacked by a boat led by Augie. The Banshee manages to escape but without their cargo. Logan is arrested by the Civil Guard but manages to escape with Augie unsuccessfully attempting to assassinate Joanna. Joanna tracks down the smuggling ring, shooting Logan and discovering the real head of the smuggling ring, who she has the Civil Guard eliminate.
