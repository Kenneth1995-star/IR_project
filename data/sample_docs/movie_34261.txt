The film shows a Friday evening in one posh Moscow nightclub, which is just celebrating the anniversary of its opening. In the club this evening the rich "mama's boy" Mikhail Bondar is having fun, who has his own big shoe producing company, although which is currently in crisis. He is very passionate, likes to argue and show off, but does not like to lose. Friends play a trick on him and offer him a dispute: he will serve the restaurant's attendees as a waiter until 3 am and if he gets 10,000 rubles a tip at the end of the evening he will win. As a prize, he will receive his friend's car or lose his. This task is difficult for Bondar who was born with the silver spoon and has a tough temper, but now he has to work hard to appease moody clients.
