Anand (Dev Anand) is a spoiled grandson of rich businessman Rai Bahadur (played by Nazir Hussain). His grandfather wants him to marry Rekha (Indira), only daughter and heiress of a rich man, in spite of Anand's disinterest for her. In the ensuring fight, Anand leaves his house to prove his worthiness and ends up in the streets of Bombay (present day Mumbai). There, one person meets Anand and takes Anand to his house in a poor neighborhood.
Anand settles himself there temporarily and tries to find work. He meets a beautiful, educated young woman Renu (Sadhana Shivdasani) and gets impressed with her. She helps him to find a job, but he soon loses it due to his incompetence. Renu works in a small company, but tells her mother (Leela Chitnis) that she is attending college. She lies to her mother that her father is sending them money. When Anand asks, she explains that she is hiding the fact that her father is dead as her mother can't tolerate that news. Anand further impresses her and asks Renu to marry him and she happily agrees.
But Rai Bahadur comes to know about Anand's whereabouts and meets him. He demands that Anand should forget Renu and marry Rekha, to which Anand disagrees. Rai Bahadur blackmails Renu that he would tell her mother about his father's death if she wouldn't marry a different person. Having no other way, she agrees and tells Anand to forget her. Renu's mother overhears this conversation and understands that her husband is no more. She accepts her fate and tells Renu that she should marry according to her own wishes. Renu and Anand marry and at the end, Rai Bahadur accepts Renu and transfers all his property to her name.
