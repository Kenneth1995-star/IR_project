Gopal (Raghuvaran) is in love with Bhuvana (Revathi) ever since they were kids. As adults, they get married.
There are two things Gopal disapproves of, after their marriage: Bhuvana's unemployed younger brother Prasad (Nagendra Prasad) who lives with them, and Mano (Karthik), Bhuvana's childhood friend.
Mano is quite handsome and a very famous singer and Bhuvana who is very fond of him, talks to him quite often on the phone. The hardworking Gopal, who loves his wife dearly, wants complete attention from her, when he feels Bhuvana gives undue attention to her friend Mano, he grows gradually very suspicious and believes that Bhuvana and Mano are secretly seeing each other, resulting in throwing Bhuvana out of the house after his jealousy completely overwhelms him.
Bhuvana who equally loves her husband and never fully understood the turmoil he was going through, receives a note of divorce from him and is devastated. Prasad and Mano try to talk to Gopal, but Bhuvana forbids it. Finally, Mano arranges a meeting with Gopal, but the situation fails.
Mano is taken aback upon finding that his platonic relationship with his best friend Bhuvana has caused Gopal with such misconstruings. They argue and Gopal finally leaves. Mano talks to Bhuvana, she thinks it is entirely her fault: If she had understood that Gopal disapproved of her close relationship to Mano, she would have never seen Mano again.
Mano leaves her and promises to never see her again. He talks to his blind girlfriend Amlu (Rohini) about what happened and Amlu finally talks reason into Gopal. Gopal arrives the moment Bhuvana is giving birth, Gopal therefore realises his misapprehensions and the purity of Bhuvana's heart, they make up: Gopal slap him and his and Bhuvana's relationship is ruined
