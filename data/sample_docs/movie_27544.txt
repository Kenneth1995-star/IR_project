Mukunda Murari

The film follows the story of an atheist, Mukunda, who sues God after losing his shop in an earthquake. Religious organizations revolt against him and Murari visits him as his human guide.
Atheist shopowner Mukunda (Upendra) talks about selling bulk statues of Hindu gods, and later tricks a devotee from Andhra Pradesh into buying a statue by claiming it's famous. The lack of respect, as his family sees it, makes his wife sad and she makes their son write the name of Rama for at least 10 pages.
