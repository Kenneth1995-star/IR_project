Sangeet Samrat Tansen

Tansen, called Ramtanu or Tanu is born dumb, but a miracle in the temple at the age five gives the boy the ability to speak and sing. His voice attracts the sage musician Swami Haridas of Brindaban. He trains the boy in the Dhrupad style. Swami Haridas gets Tanu to study under Muhammad Ghaus, where he lives with his childhood mate Hansa. Several years pass and Ghaus asks Tanu to shift to the court of Raja Ramchandra. This disappoints Tanu as he has plans to marry Hansa. However, he ventures forth to the palace where his voice is applauded and he is awarded the title of Sangeet Shiromani Tansen. His singing reputation reaches Emperor Akbar, who invites him to join his court singers. There, he becomes one of the nine jewels of the Emperor's exceptionally talented men. The story then follows misunderstandings with his beloved Hansa, his singing prowess and finally his getting united once again with Hansa.
