Brahmachari

Audumbar is a young and ordinary man. On one occasion he happens to listen to the lecture given by Deshbhakta Jatashankar. Jatashankar in his speech emphasizes on discipline and celibacy, the principals of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. This speech inspires Audumbar and he decides to join the institute of Acharya Chandiram. He renounces his sexual desires and also throws away his collection of posters of film actors.
But at the institute, he comes across Kishori, a young woman and all his vows to Brahmacharya are tested.
