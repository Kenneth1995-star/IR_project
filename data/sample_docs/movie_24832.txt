Be-Imaan

Seth Jamna Das's (Raj Mehra) only college-going daughter Sapna (Rakhee) is involved with poor Shyam (Manoj Kumar). Failing to persuade her, and prevail upon her to marry DIG Gopal Das's (Prem Nath) only son, Deepak (Prem Chopra) he agrees to marry off the lovers. But on the night of marriage Shyam is not only accused of a safe break but also death of Kamini (Snehlata), and forced to join the criminals in a spate of robberies after one of which there is a showdown between him and the rest, and he manages to escape and lands in a town where he saves a young girl, Meena (Nazima) from a group of hooligans, who then forces him to come to her house for first aid treatment. Meena is the daughter of an honest cop, Constable Ram Singh (Pran) who instantly adopts him (now called Mohan) as his son.
Notwithstanding continuity jerks; now all actions (murders, rapes, gold smuggling) and characters find themselves in the same town. And the lecherous Deepak in partnership with Jamna Das is the kingpin of all unlawful activities even though DIG Gopal Das is honesty personified. In the swiftly changing scenario, the old lovers get reunited, songs and dances in flashback follow, Shyam/Mohan finds out Kamini is alive, after some fisticuffs he is arrested, Ram Singh gets promoted as Sub-Inspector, but in a chase to prevent Deepak/Jamna Das's consignment with gold he falls prey to the former's bullet. DIG Gopal Das gets him cremated with full honours, vowing to get the culprit booked. Jamna Das agrees to marry off Sapna to Deepak to consolidate his nefarious activities but Shyam/Mohan spoils the party leading to a showdown between the partners.
Not only that, he also convinces the DIG about his son's doings, how he had been hoodwinked into the aiding them, and brings him to the scene of action where the party is in a confessional mode. And in an attempt to escape, Deepak even fires at his father.[1]
