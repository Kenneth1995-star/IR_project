Amaran

An orphaned kid (Karthik) helps Govindan (Vijayakumar) escape from a bunch of gangsters. The kid is named Amaran ('The immortal') by the grateful Govindan and is brought up by him. After Govindan's demise, his wife (Manjula Vijayakumar) raises Amaran who grows up to become a kind-hearted slum lord. One day, Amaran encounters a strange man, Raja Varma (Prathap K. Pothan) who repeatedly persuades him to take on a heartless don named Aandava Perumal (Radha Ravi), who has a violent and brutal past. Amaran keeps ignoring Raja Varma but after Raja Varma is murdered by Perumal's goons, he learns that Aandava Perumal had also destroyed his own family when he was a child. Amaran gives refuge to Raja Varma's daughter Sivagaami (Bhanupriya) and they fall in love with each other. Amaran soon starts sparring with Perumal with deadly consequences to Amaran's adopted family. Sivagaami and a grievously injured Amaran escape to Goa, where they are taken care of by an underworld don Menon (Shammi Kapoor). Amaran continues to work for him for a while and gets married to Sivagaami. After a few years he returns to Tamil Nadu to take on his sworn enemy and a bloody conflict ensues. During this conflict, Amaran's son gets killed and the film ends with Amaran killing Aandava Perumal while saying, "this wouldn't have happened if you had not killed my son".
