Seerivarum Kaalai

Kaalayan (Ramarajan) is the do-gooder with a helping hand living in a village. Kaalayan falls in love with his sister's friend Kamakshi (Abitha) who is tortured and harassed by her sister-in-law Nandini (Vichitra), while Kamakshi's mother (Manorama) and brother (Mansur Ali Khan) are helpless spectators. After the initial hesitation the timid Kamakshi also reciprocates Kaalayan's love. Nandini does not want Kamakshi to get married to Kaalayan. The duo elopes and gets married. After a violent bashing up of Kaalayan & Kamakshi by Nandini's men, the doctors warn Kaalayan that Kamakshi's health would be endangered if she were to bear a child. But Kamakshi drugs Kaalayan and seduces him. She conceives, but there is nothing to worry. The doctors are proved wrong and she delivers twins. It is time for Kaalayan and the gang to hold up their two fingers in 'victory' style.
