My Big Bossing

A little girl named Jessa wished to be a mermaid. The wish was granted when the girl was drowned in swimming pool after meeting a witch (Pauleen Luna), transforming her into a mermaid-goldfish hybrid.
A little girl died and helped an unbeliever who works as a reporter to cope with his beliefs.
A princess whose name is Biiktoria was said to be an ugly girl so the sister of the Queen, together with her husband planned to exchange her son as a prince of the kingdom and someday become a king. The princess lives together with the pigs so she thinks that she is also a pig. In the end, Torius proclaimed that the princess' name came from his, therefore she was named Victoria. She was recognized by his father, the king, who was sick and accepted her daughter even if she is ugly. [clarification needed]
