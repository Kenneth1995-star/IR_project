Usta

Dogan, a car mechanic in a small town, is obsessed with flying. He has been building a small biplane in his back yard for years. His wife Emine does not share his affinity for aviation and feels neglected in their marriage. When Dogan's plane crashes during an aeronautics fair, she gives him an ultimatum: he can either pursue his passion for flying or live a humble life with her, solely as a car mechanic.
