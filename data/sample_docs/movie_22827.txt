Time Raiders

Raised by his Uncle Wu Sanxing (Wang Jingchun), Wu Xie (Luhan) is fascinated by old architecture and antiques. Once, his family had got a very special piece of bronze by accident, but when they dug deeper, they traced and found a lost kingdom buried in the basin of north-west China named Xiwangmu Dynasty. Thus, Wuâ€™s family recruited a group of expert raiders, including a mysterious stranger by the name of Zhang Qiling (Jing Boran), and went deep into the ruins of the ancient city.
