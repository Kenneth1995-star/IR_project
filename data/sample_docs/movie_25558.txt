Sandhya (Dimple Kapadia) and Nikhil (Shekhar Kapur) are a happily married, urban, professional couple. Coming from middle-class families, they have risen in their professional life by virtue of merit and hard work.
On their eighth wedding anniversary, one of their friends brings his nephew Rahul (Irrfan Khan) who is a classical singer. Sandhya develops an attraction and has an affair with him. She confides in her friend Prabha but does not tell Nikhil. After a couple of months, the affair ends.
