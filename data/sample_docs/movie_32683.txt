Rudhramadevi

Ganapatideva was the emperor of the Kakatiya dynasty who rules Kakatiya Empire from Orugallu(present day Warangal, Telangana) as its Capital. With Kakatiya Dynasty at a problem, Ganapatideva's wife gives birth to a baby girl, but as the Dynasty is in big trouble and the people want a prince, not a princess the minister advises king to announce the baby girl as a boy. Rudramadevi was formally designated as a son and given the male name Rudradeva, through the ancient Putrika ceremony. But, during Rudramadevi’s birth, an astrologer predicted that a baby girl is born to rule the kingdom jointly with her father as his co-regent from 1259–60 under the name of Rudradeva Maharaja.
In the first two or three years of their joint rule, the kingdom was thrown into confusion and disorder due to Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I's invasion and the disastrous defeat of the Kakatiyas and their allies on the battle field of Muttukur, near Nellore. Though Ganapatideva was ultimately successful in turning back the tide of invasion, he suffered loss of territory and prestige and his hold over his feudatories and nobles was shaken. Under these circumstances, he retired from active politics. Rudramadevi gets married to Veerabhadra, a Vengi Chalukya (a branch of the Chalukyas of Badami) prince of Nidadavolu.
