Three hardcore criminals escape from a jail by overpowering the guards and snatching their guns. Once out in the street, they first snatch a car from a man passing that way, and then steal clothes from three other passers-by, and get themselves dressed in the same. Then they forcibly enter into a newspaper editor's house, taking him and his family hostage. After many incidents they finally get killed one-by-one.
Three jailed convicts Himmat, his brother Ajit, and Dilawar Khan break out of prison and take over the household of Editor Ashok Rai. Held hostage against their will are Ashok Rai, his wife Deepa Rai, son, Rajoo and gorgeous sister Naina.

Wadekar, who have absolutely no clue of the whereabouts of the convicts.
