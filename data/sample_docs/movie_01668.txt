The Crime Doctor

Famous detective Dan Gifford arrives home he is surprised to find his wife, Andra, is attracted to famous crime novelist, Eric Anderson. Jealous, he decides to write his own crime novel. When he overhears Andra on the phone with Eric later that evening, he plans to commit the perfect murder and to frame Eric for it. In order to accomplish this, he hires Blanche Flynn, an ex-con, to rent the apartment above Eric's and to keep notes on Eric's activity. However, when Blanche sees Andra entering the apartment, she decides to make a new deal for herself. She approaches Eric and blackmails him for $10,000 to keep the affair secret. Eric agrees, and sets up a meeting with her the following evening to deliver the money.
When Gifford finds out about the blackmail scheme, he realizes the perfect moment to hatch his own scheme as arrived. Offering to help Anderson, he arranges for Anderson to come to his office prior to the money exchange. When Anderson heads to Gifford's office, Gifford sneaks into his apartment, and steals a gun, knowing that Anderson keeps a gun collection. He then quickly goes down to Blanche's apartment, where he murders the young woman, after forcing her to write a note explaining she was romantically involved with Anderson, and implicating him in her murder.
With all the evidence pointing to him, Anderson is convicted of the murder, and sentenced to death. However, Gifford's plan begins to unfold when Andra refuses to accept the evidence, not believing that Anderson is capable of such a heinous crime. When Gifford understands the depth of his wife's feelings for Anderson, he writes a note confessing to the murder, and then commits suicide.
However, it is then revealed that the events of the contrived murder and subsequent events were all simply part of the book Gifford had sat down to begin writing at the beginning of the film. None of it was real.
