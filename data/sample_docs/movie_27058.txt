Aa Gaya Hero

ACP Ravindra Varma (Govinda) is a daredevil and sincere police officer who has been called in order to nab a dreaded terrorist (Milind Shinde). During his attempts to catch the terrorist, Ravindra Varma realises that there are two ministers (Surendra Pal and Makrand Deshpande) who work hand in glove with the said terrorist.
Besides them, there are two brothers (Murali Sharma and Ashutosh Rana) who form the right hand of the two corrupt ministers. Does the righteous ACP Ravindra Varma manage to bring the crooks to book or does he become unsuccessful in doing so, is what forms the rest of the film.
