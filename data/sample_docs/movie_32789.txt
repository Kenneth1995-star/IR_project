She later becomes his partner for a company project and she eventually falls for him too. She decides to introduce Anand to her father (Nassar), who has been waiting for his daughter to get married. Although Meghana's father rejects him at first due to his pickiness, Anand saves his stolen bag from a bunch of goons and he accepts him as his son-in-law.
