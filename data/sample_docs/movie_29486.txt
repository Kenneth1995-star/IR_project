Velli Vizha

Bala (Gemini Ganesan) and Bhanu (Jayanthi) is a happily married couple. Everything seems fine till Sheela (Vanisri) enters their lives. Bala is a tennis champion and Sheela claims to be his fan. The family members raise objection to this liaison but Bhanu trusts her husband blindly. Bala takes undue advantage of this trust and continues to meet Sheela on the sly till one day Bhanu stumbles upon the truth. This breach of trust breaks Bhanu which eventually leads to her death. An unrepentant Bala takes this as an opportunity and proposes to marry Sheela. His mother is shattered but gives in to his demands. An elated Bala rushes to Sheela only to find her missing! Was it poetic justice?
