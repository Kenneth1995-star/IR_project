For several years, Thangapandi (Prabhu) is in feud with his stepbrothers (Ponvannan and Vignesh).
In the past, Durairasu Thevar (Sivaji Ganesan), the village chief, planned the marriage of his daughter Nachiyar (Raadhika) and she got married with a rich man. Few days later, after the birth of Thangapandi, her husband died and Durairasuthevar forced her daughter to remarry with her cousin Kathiresan Thevar(Sivakumar). Then, Thangapandi became jealous of, the new born, Sellasamy and decided to live with his grandfather Durairasu Thevar. After, Durairasu Thevar's death, the conflict has hardened.
The liquor smuggler Angusamy (Ilavarasu) hates Thangapandi since Thangapandi beats him. Sellasamy (Ponvannan) wants to get married after his uncle Angusamy's advices but that's disrespectful to not arrange the marriage for the elder son first. Finally, Sellasamy got married before Thangapandi.
Meanwhile, Malar (Saranya Ponvannan) is in love with her cousin Thangapandi and he proposes her. At Thangapandi's marriage, Nachiyar comes to see it secretly and she saw how her son Thangapandi loves her.
Later, Nachiyar falls ill and Thangapandi give milk (custom in village) to end her sufferings.
