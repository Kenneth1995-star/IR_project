 I.C.U.

Teenager Tristen Waters, her brother Troy and his friend Ricky go to their father William's holiday apartment, spending most of their time alone while William works as a policeman to pay off the damage caused by the gambling problem that ended his marriage with Tristan and Troy's mother. While there, the three of them start to spy on their neighbors and soon notice that one of their neighbors is hiring prostitutes who go into the house but never come out. When the man discovers they are filming him, they hide in the apartment, only to be found and tied up by the murderer later. William shows up and a fight ensues, causing him to be knocked out. He later awakens and tells the killer "I thought I told you to wait till their mother was here" before shooting him to death.
Frantic, William prepares to kill his children, only to be stabbed to death by his ex-wife. It is then revealed that his ex-wife is the killer of the prostitutes and has been filming the murders after the bodies were supplied to her by the pimp. She finds a text sent to her saying "I C U." She notices a camera in the room, one of the many cameras that are planted all over the hotel, and seems to recognize the person operating them. The person operating the cameras is left unknown.
