100 Ways to Murder Your Wife

Two well-respected football players meet one night in a Hong Kong bar. Roberto is a highly rated striker for a popular team while Football Fa is a star goalkeeper. Over a few drinks, the pair share compliments and, as the evening draws on, their problems. As things turn out, both of these cowardly men have the same major problem: their wives. Roberto's wife Anita constantly nags him and designs outrageous outfits that she insists he wears. Meanwhile, Football Fa is insanely jealous about his beautiful wife Wong Siu-yin and her popularity with his team-mates. Falling into a drunken stupor, both men foolishly agree to get rid of each other's wives. Football Fa seems to have succeeded when he goes to Roberto's house and wakes up thinking he has done the deed. In actual fact, Roberto's wife has left thinking that her husband is with another woman. These two misunderstandings remain hidden though and Football Fa, recovering from the distressing thought of being a murderer, insists that Roberto returns the favour. What follows is an elaborate series of ideas to achieve this dubious goal and get away with it free from blame.
