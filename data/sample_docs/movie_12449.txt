Gumby: The Movie

When the Blockheads' E-Z Loan company threatens to take away the farms belonging to the small farmers due to being unable to make their loan payments, Gumby and his band, the Clayboys, decide to have a benefit concert to save the farms. But when the evil Blockheads find out that Gumby's dog, Lowbelly, cries pearls when he sees the Clayboys perform, they decide to kidnap Lowbelly and force him to cry pearls (unaware Lowbelly was crying whenever Gumby changed his shape). When he doesn't respond, they kidnap Gumby and the Clayboys and create robotic clones of them.
With the help of Pokey, Prickle, Goo, fans Tara and Ginger, and talent agent Lucky Claybert, Gumby takes on his robot clone and is still in time for his video taping session in agreement with Claybert. At a picnic, Gumby announces that he's opening his own farm loan company that will give reasonable loans for its customers. The Blockheads are forced to weed Gumby's garden as punishment, and the eponymous duo Gumby and Pokey decide that things are looking up for them as they head back to outer space.
