Manchi Manushulu

Radha (Manjula) is a medical student daughter of wealthy man, Raghupati Rao (Nagabhushanam). While on a trip to Simla, she meets and falls in love with Gopi (Shobhan Babu); they get intimate with each other. Gopi asks Raghupati Rao for his daughter's hand but he refuses, on the ground that the hard-up Gopi is not worthy of her. Gopi leaves Radha a note, explaining that her father refused the alliance and that he is heading to meet his mother, who is very sick. Raghupati Rao gets hold of the letter before Radha. He changes the letter with a fake one that says Gopi is going away because Raghupati Rao has refused to provide any monetary compensation.
Years later, Gopi and Radha are fated to meet again. This time, Gopi is accompanied by a handicapped boy, Babu (Master Tito), while Radha is about to get engaged to Dr. Ramesh (Jaggayya). It is revealed that Babu is Gopi and Radha's son. Gopi has come to Dr.Ramesh for Babu's treatment. Radha was pregnant when her father sent Gopi away. She gave birth to a baby, but her father told her that it was still-born. Gopi took his son and promised Raghupati Rao that he would never tell Radha about the child. Dr.Ramesh treats Babu as Radha tries to hide her past from Dr.Ramesh. Radha learns the truth about Babu's birth and confronts her father, who confesses and asks her forgiveness while Babu is united with his parents.
