Give Us the Moon

Although made in 1943-44, the film is set in peacetime Britain, a few years after the end of World War II. Peter Pyke, the son of a millionaire hotel owner, had been a RAF pilot during the war but, much to the frustration of his hard-working father, he doesn't want to work for a living and instead wastes his time away, living in his father's hotel (aptly named "Eisenhower Hotel" after Dwight D. Eisenhower who lead the Allied invasion in 1944). So when Peter finds a club founded by people, mainly White Russian émigrés, who refuse to be of any use to society, he immediately joins them.
