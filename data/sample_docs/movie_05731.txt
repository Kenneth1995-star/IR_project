The Sellout

Big-city newspaper editor Haven D. Allridge (Pidgeon) starts a crusade against corrupt small-town sheriff Burke (Gomez) after he gets a first-hand taste of Burke's version of justice. Although Burke blackmails Allridge into silence using the misdeeds of Allridge's son-in-law, county prosecutor Randy Stauton (Mitchell), state attorney Chick Johnson (Hodiak) continues the fight.
