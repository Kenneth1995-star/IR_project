Sharjah to Sharjah

Unni is wrongly accused of murder of Kannan in Dubai. Sheikh Jasim Khalid Mubarak tells Unni's brother Nandagopalan Vishwanathan that he can release Unni if he can get a letter from Kannan's family that they have pardoned Unni and all the members of Kannan's family should sign the letter. Nandagopalan goes to Kannan's house disguised as a Sheikh from Sharjah and trying to fool everyone in signing the letter without telling the truth of the contents of the letter. Little does Nandu know that the Sheikh is trying to fool him as well as he has written something else in the letter. How Nandu convinces Kannan's family to get the signatures and how he rescues Unni from the authorities and the evil Sheikh forms the rest of the story.
