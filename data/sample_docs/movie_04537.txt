The Pretender

The story tells of Kenneth Holden (Dekker), a crooked investment businessman who embezzles a large sum of money from an estate. He hopes to cover his crime by marrying the estate's heiress Claire Worthington (Craig).
However, Worthington is already engaged, so Holden arranges for her fianc√© to be killed. The hired hit man's only means of identifying the victim is the picture in the society columns. When Claire Worthington changes her mind and agrees to marry Holden, however, it means that it is his picture that will appear in the newspaper, thereby condemning him to death.
Desperately trying to contact the hit man, Holden discovers that the man is dead, but his successor is still at large.
