Nammina Bantu

Bhujangarao (Gummadi) a cruel landlord employs Chandraiah (S. V. Ranga Rao) in his mango orchards and after successfully cultivating it, instead of the promised fertile land, he gives Chandraiah a barren piece of land. Chandraiah’s daughter Lakshmi (Savitri) wins the bull race defeating Rao’s trusted servant Prasad (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and the reward money is used to dig a bore well. Peeved by this Rao asks Prasad to poison the bulls Ramudu and Lakshmanudu which Prasad refuses and leaves his service to join Chandraiah and the poor farmers to cultivate the barren land. They are supported by Rao’s daughter Sarala (Girija) and nephew Devaiah (Relangi) who advocates cooperative farming. This irks Rao and he plots to thwart their plans but ends up falling into a bog and dies.
