Arjun

Arjun (Mahesh Babu) and his twin sister Meenakshi (Keerthi Reddy) finish college, and their parents decide to look for a good man to marry Meenakshi. Meenakshi shows her brother a letter from their friend Uday (Raja Abel), who confesses his love for her and asks her to elope with him as his parents (Bala Nayagar (Prakash Raj) and Andal (Saritha)) are arranging his marriage with a different girl. Meenakshi tells her brother that she too is interested in Uday and Arjun goes to Madurai in Tamil Nadu, where Uday lives with his parents and is about to get married. Arjun makes a dramatic appearance, and tells Uday's parents about the letter their son has written and asks their consent for marriage. However, Uday dares to marry Meenakshi before their parents' approval comes. Uday's parents apparently agree for Meenakshi as their daughter-in-law, though they have different plans in mind.
Meanwhile Arjun meets a girl Roopa (Shriya Saran) who happens to be from Madurai too, and after some teasing, they fall for each other. Here in Meenakshi's house, Uday's parents secretly plan to kill Meenakshi, as they had lost a chance to grab a millionaire's property by the arranged marriage. They make multiple attempts to kill Meenakshi but she survives. Arjun comes to conclusion with multiple clues that they are trying to kill his sister, but Uday and Meenakshi don't believe him. At last she believes when they try to kill her while Uday was away and escapes with the help of her brother and gives birth to twins. In that fight, Bala Nayagar dies and Andal becomes paralytic. Uday watches how they tried to kill his wife and at last believes Arjun's version. They all reconcile and live peacefully.
