Over the Moon

Jane Benson (Merle Oberon) is a lowly Yorkshire girl who lives simply, caring for her elderly, ailing uncle and not wishing for anything more. She does take a fancy, however, to the local doctor, Freddie Jarvis (Rex Harrison), and she persuades him to marry her. Soon she finds she has inherited eighteen million pounds and wants to travel across Europe with Freddie Jarvis; however he wants to stay as he is dedicated to his patients.[1] So she leaves for Europe without him and is followed by suitors who are not necessarily interested in her personality. Meanwhile, back in Yorkshire, Dr Jarvis becomes notorious as the man who turned down Â£18 million and the infamy seriously affects his ability for serious research.[2]
