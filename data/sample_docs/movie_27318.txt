Julie

Julie (Ramya) is a young Christian woman who finds herself pregnant after having sex with Shashi (Dino Morea), a Hindu follower and her childhood sweetheart. Faced with the choice of abortion or carrying the child to term, Julie chooses to keep the pregnancy a secret from Shashi and goes to a convent, where she will deliver the child and put it up for adoption. Afterwards Julie returns home in the hopes that Shashi will marry her now that she does not have a baby, as she thought that he would not have shown an interest in her otherwise. Despite her well-laid plans, Julie finds that things aren't so simple as that. Not only does her brother want her to move to England, but she also meets Richard, a man who doesn't care that she has had a baby out of wedlock. Ultimately Julie manages to reconcile with Shashi and live happily ever after.
