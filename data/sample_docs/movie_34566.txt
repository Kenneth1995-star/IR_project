Kang-do is a heartless man with no living family members whose job is to threaten debtors into repaying his clients, loan sharks who demand a 10x return on a one-month loan. To recover the interest, the debtors sign an insurance application for handicap, and Kang-do injures them brutally so that they file the claim. One day he receives a visit from a strange middle-aged woman claiming she is his long-lost mother. Over the following weeks, she stubbornly follows him, and he continues to do his job. But he is slowly moved and changed by her motherly love.[18]
