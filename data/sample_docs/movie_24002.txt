Chirodini Tumi Je Amar

Krishna (Rahul Banerjee) is a diligent scooter mechanic in Siliguri and life goes on smoothly for him until the rich schoolgirl Pallavi (Priyanka Sarkar) sets her eyes on him. The infatuation reaches dangerous levels when she coaxes Krishna to take her away from the clutches of her family, which has other plans about her future. The film begins with the elopement, as Pallavi steps out of her house in her school uniform, leaving even her wristwatch behind since Krishna has instructed her not to take a single thing with her. The two rush into a shopping mall where Pallavi hurriedly changes into a boy’s shirt, pants and cap, leaves her uniform behind, and the two board the bus.
The flashback, as point-of-view narrations between Pallavi and Krishna, are intercut with Pallavi’s don-like father and uncle terrorizing the neighbourhood in search of the truant girl. Krishna hesitantly yields to her charm and the two run away to Kolkata. Krishna's friend Ali (Rudranil Ghosh) and his group at Kolkata helps them, and the lovers marry. The couple consummates their union while the mess chaps hastily organize a proper wedding and elaborate reception.
The family tracks down the couple and offers to come back. While coming back Pallavi's family separates them. Krishna gets beaten by her father's gang. Pallavi agrees to marry another man to save Krishna's life and loses sense. Krishna took one branch of Pallavi's hand and leaves that place. While she believes this decision is best and moves on with her life.
After three years, getting married to an another man and having a baby, she one day (while on the road with her husband and daughter) finds Krishna in street as a mad who suffered permanent brain damage from his beating. She finds those branches on his hand but she does not make him recalled about her.
