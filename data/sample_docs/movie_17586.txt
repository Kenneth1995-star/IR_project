Incident at Raven's Gate

On a farming property called Raven's Gate, enthusiastic hydroponicist Richard Cleary (Ritchie Singer) is trying innovative farming practices. He is also trying to accommodate his brother Eddie (Steven Vidler), newly out of gaol and more interested in Richard's wife Rachel (Celine Griffin)[2] than in working on the property. Strange events on the property and a minor crime in the town attract policeman Taylor (Max Cullen) and Special Branch investigator Cummings (Terry Camilleri). Eddie has the misfortune to also cross local cop Skinner (Vincent Gil), by dating the target of his affections, barmaid Annie (Saturday Rosenberg). Tensions in personal relationships and mysterious events (bird kills, disappearing water supplies) build to a climax that sees Raven's Gate assaulted by an alien force, and a number of deaths amongst the protagonists.[3][4] The film closes with the stunned survivors Eddie and Rachel standing outside Raven's Gate homestead, newly restored by Special Branch, and the soundtrack playing the Easybeats song Friday on My Mind.
