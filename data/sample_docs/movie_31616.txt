The wealthy Ajay and the poor Vijay (both roles played by ANR) are lookalikes. Having met accidentally, they share their miseries and exchange places with each other for a year with an agreement. Ajay’s cunning manager Bhanoji (Gummadi) plan to usurp his wealth. Vijay who is now impersonating Ajay, foils his plots. Bhanoji’s daughter Sarala (Rajasulochana) sincerely loves him. Ajay who is now impersonating Vijay joins as a mechanic and falls in love with colleague Prakash’s (Nanduri Muralikrishna) sister Padma (E.V. Saroja). While settling his sister Meena’s (Sarada) marital life by doling out the money to her avaricious father-in-law Parandhamaiah (Relangi), he forges his own signature and taken into custody. Bhanoji learns about the agreement between Ajay and Vijay and hastens the marriage of Sarala with Ajay knowing well that he is Vijay. The subsequent events lead to Bhanoji’s confession and the story ends on a happy note with real Vijay marrying Sarala and Ajay marrying Padma.
