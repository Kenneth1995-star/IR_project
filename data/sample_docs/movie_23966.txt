Kashinath and Raju are villagers of Palashpur village. They are very close friends. Kashinath is not a good student, while Raju is brilliant. Kashinath gets a T.C from his school because of hurting the school teacher. Raju's parents decide to send him to Kolkata for higher studies. Raju and Kashinath go to a studio to get a photograph of themselves. After that Raju leaves for Kolkata. After 15 years Raju is well settled in life. He is doing a good job. But Kashinath has not completed his studies. They are very good friends even now. One day Kashinath comes to Kolkata to meet Raju. They both enjoy a lot. Kashinath is not habituated with the environment of Kolkata. He is not familiar with the social etiquettes. One day Kashinath meets Bobby in Manisha's birth day party. Manisha is the only daughter of Rajus landlord. In this party everybody treats Kashinath like a joking stuff. But Bobby does not support that. Raju tells Kashinath to keep safe distance from these girls. But Bobby one day suddenly proposes to Kashinath. Kashinath feels uncomfortable. Raju becomes angry. Raju tries to make Kashinath understand that Bobby is not suitable for him. Because Bobby is an ultra modern educated lady and she comes from a very rich family. Bobbys elder brother Rishi threatens Kashinath and Bobby. Rishi appoints some goons to teach Kashinath a good lesson. Kashinath also realises his love for Bobby. Raju again forbids them to continue this relationship, because this may be harmful for Kashinath. Rishi lodges a false complaint to the police against Kashinath. Police arrests him. Police tortures Kashinath very badly. On the other hand, Manisha loves Raju, but Raju does not pay any attention to her. Lastly everybody understands their mistake. Kashinath gets married with Bobby and Raju also agrees to marry Manisha.
