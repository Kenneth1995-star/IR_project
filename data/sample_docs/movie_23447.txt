Jim (Michael Tse) and Roy are friends living together. Jim has recently broken up with his girlfriend and decides to meet new girls through a social networking website ICQ. There, he meets a girl Hiroko (Liz Kong) and they become friends.
Both Jim and Roy find Hiroko attractive and Roy plans to have a one-night stand with her. He uses Jim's ICQ account and asks Hiroko out where then they meet in Ma Liu Shui. However, Roy never comes back from his meeting with Hiroko and is later found dead.
