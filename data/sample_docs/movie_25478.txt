Daisy

Pradeep Menon is a troubled teenager who studies in a Boarding school in Ooty in the Nilgiris. He is regarded as a trouble-maker and is often punished by his teachers and headmaster, often severely. When beautiful Daisy Thomas joins the school, he makes fun of her on the first day, thus beginning a series of misadventures that result in more punishment for him. This brings him close to Daisy, and they are attracted to each other.
Daisy understands why Pradeep is so aggressive and offers him considerable support. She is shocked to see how rude he is toward his mother, Malathi Menon, but is unable to do anything about it. She later learns the reason behind his hatred was that his mother had decided to re-marry after his father's death and had started spending less time with him.
Things improve considerably when Malati is confined in a hospital and Pradeep goes to visit her, thereby improving their relationship. Pradeep starts to respond positively to Daisy's support and is all set to turn a new leaf. Then Pradeep's world is turned upside down when he witnesses Daisy in the arms of James â€” a complete stranger. Shocked at this, Pradeep regresses to his self-destructive phase, alienating himself from everyone. He later learns that James is her older brother and that she is a terminally ill patient. Things go bad when his mother dies and he loses Daisy as well. The movie ends with him finding solace in James.
