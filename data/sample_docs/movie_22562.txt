Fengming, a Chinese Memoir

Caught up the fervor of the Chinese Revolution, she abandoned her plans to study at university and took a job at the Gansu Daily newspaper. Her husband, fellow journalist Wang Jingchao, wrote several critical essays at the height of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. With the launch of the subsequent Anti-Rightist Movement, Wang was attacked for these statements, and she was condemned by association. The two were sent to separate labor camps, where Wang eventually died.[1] He Fengming was released, briefly imprisoned again during the Cultural Revolution,[2] and finally rehabilitated. In the early 1990s she published a memoir, My Life in 1957.[3]
