Naam

Kumaran (M. G. Ramachandran) is the heir to a zamindari estate, which he learns from his dying mother. However, the will and the related testament are hidden by Malayappan (Veerappa). A doctor Sanjeevi (M. G. Chakrapani) is also interested in the property and wants his daughter (Saraswathi) to marry Kumaran. Against his wishes, Kumaran is in love with Malayappan's sister Meena (Janaki). When Meena gets the will, Kumaran suspects her intentions, and leaves the village. In the city, he becomes a boxer. Meanwhile, Malayappan sets Kumaran's house on fire and Kumaran is presumed dead. However, he is saved by Meena. More complications arise about the missing will, and simultaneously, a disfigured boxer moves around at night, leading to rumours about a ghost in the village. However, the truth is eventually revealed, and the lovers are united.[1]
