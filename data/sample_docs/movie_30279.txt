Nadaraj (Livingston) is an honest, not-too-good-looking, village artist who comes to the city to find a job. He ends up being a banner artist. Shwetha (Kousalya) is a U.S. citizen, who loves India and its culture and stays with her relatives to learn bharatanatiyam. She is a soft-natured, loving girl who loves to help people in distress but cannot stand it if anyone lies or cheats. Initially when these two meet, she mistakes Nadaraj to be a mute and pities him. Shwetha's occasional friendlier association with Nadaraj, in the means of helping, gradually blossoms into love. By this time, it is too late for the guilt-ridden Nadaraj to disclose the truth as he feared the risk of losing her. Despite all his efforts to reveal the truth, Shwetha comes to know of his sham by herself. However at the end she realises Nadaraj's true intentions for acting as a mute and forgives him. However at the climax, when Shwetha asks Nadaraj to speak to her, he keeps silent because he had asked a doctor to cut his tongue so that he could be the Nadaraj Swetha had come to love.
