The Truth

Raymond Lau (Andy Lau) is a young lawyer who grew up in an orphanage who fought a lawsuit for a prostitute Lau Wai Lan (Deanie Ip), but he still did not know that Wai Lan is his mother.
Lau Wai Lan still lives a harsh life, often being extorted by CID officers, she leads a quite miserable life. Unfortunately, his son's birth certificate falls into the hands of the harsh police officer Wong Fat (Kirk Wong), who extorts a large sum of money from Wai Lan, and forces her to cheat in a mahjong game, and was caught and beaten. With help from her prostitute sisters, they raise a large sum of money, however, Wong Fat has gone back on its words, and out of desperation, Wai Lan killed Wong Fat and was arrested for pending trial. When Sister Mary of the orphanage was aware of the matter, she finds Raymond again to defend Wai Lan. Wai Lan does not want to let his son know about their relationship, she rather commit suicide to end it. Fortunately, she was rescued. In the hospital, Sister Mary could not help but to tell Raymond the secret, telling him Wai Lan is the unknown uncle who paid for his studies abroad, and that she is his mother.
Raymond has had friction with the judge and prosecutor (Paul Chun), and with profound grievances, it was a disadvantage for him to defend his mother. For the sake of his mother, Raymond bribed witnesses and his acts of instigating false statements brought to light and is on the verge of facing penalties for knowingly violating the law. Raymond tells of his real identity in court, tells the greatness of his mother Wai Lan, which the final jury agreed to Wai Lan not guilty for murder, while accusing the judge for his bad attitude and bring unjust, saying that if the judge can not give a lighter sentence, he clearly has personality problems. Finally, the judge ruled out that Wai Lan is sent to three years incarceration, suspended for five years, and was released immediately.
