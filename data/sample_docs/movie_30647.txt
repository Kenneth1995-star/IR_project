Elangovan (Thankar Bachchan) is a school teacher in Chidambaram who is a jack of all trades but master of none. He spends time with friends boozing, gambling and trying out new business that always fails.
His wife is Thenmozhi (Navya Nair) and has two daughters. Elangovanâ€™s father (Pyramid Natarajan) and his father-in-law (Sundararajan) try to make him responsible towards his family but our man refuses to take up anything serious in life. On advice of everyone, Elangovan goes to Sabarimala after taking Vrath but returns to continue as sanyasi without being least bothered about his duties towards family. Fearing his wife and relatives he decides to join a mutt but there also he is unable to sustain.
In the meantime Thenmozhi works hard to educate her children. She is mentally prepared to live without her husband when Elangovan returns and pleads with her as usual. But this time Thenmozhi is not willing to pardon him and she ignores him. What happens then forms the climax and message of the film.
