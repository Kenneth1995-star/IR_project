Lucky Kapoor (Fardeen Khan) lives in Australia and has no interest in taking over his father Virendra Kapoor's (Harsh Chhaya) business in India. Meanwhile, Saba Karim Khan (Feroz Khan) has a great interest in a plot of land owned by Mr. Kapoor, but Mr. Kapoor has no interest in selling. Khan thus has Mr. Kapoor killed, making it look like an accident. Jessica Periera (Celina Jaitley), a childhood sweetheart of Lucky, has proof that Mr. Kapoor's death was not an accident—but she keeps it to herself. When Karim Khan meets with Lucky to renegotiate, he finds that Lucky is willing to sell—but he also discovers that Lucky bears a striking resemblance to his own dead son. Although Karim Khan will do anything to make Lucky heir to his own wealth and properties, Lucky remains unwilling.
