Nadi Vahate

Should I save my river and how? These are the questions that drive this entire film. It focuses on the relationship between a river and people along its banks with respect to their life, needs, desires and greed. Saving small rivers flowing through different villages is the need of the hour. It is the only way to sustainable development. Smaller, indigenous businesses and efforts along the river banks are very important. These efforts will lead villages to become self dependent and also balance of development will be achieved. This film is a journey of people's constructive resistance to save their river and to become self sufficient.[citation needed]
