Love and Bullets

Phoenix Police Detective Charlie Congers is tasked to assist the FBI in bringing a gangster's girlfriend, Jackie Pruitt, back to the USA to testify. The FBI thinks she can give inside information to law enforcement that will put Joe Bomposa behind bars once and for all.
It turns out that Pruitt doesn't know much of anything useful to the FBI. The trouble is, Bomposa wants her dead anyway, feeling betrayed, while Congers is falling in love with her. Bomposa has her shot while she embraces Congers before she leaves for the US under the protection of the FBI.
