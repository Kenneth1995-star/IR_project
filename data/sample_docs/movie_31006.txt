A group of four youngsters get on a train, they are then scold by a quick-tempered stranger Ananthakrishnan (Prakash Raj), he tells them that today's young people are immature and good-for-nothing. The friends are about to prove him wrong.
Nandhini Velu Nachiyar (Srushti Dange), Reshmi Kaur (Amrita Chhabria), Mahesh Muthusamy (Nadhim Khan), Mohammed Aslam (Roshan Nawaz) and Angelina Kristy (Nakshatra) were visual communication students and best friends. After the graduation, they had to split up and to go in different directions, then they met the magician Thyagu (Krishnakumar Balasubramanian), and everything changed. Thyagu and Nandhini were childhood friends, and were in love with each other. Both were from different caste, Nandhini's brother-in-law Raja Rajasekharan (Vijay Gopal) was a despicable caste fanatic and an influential person, he had hatred towards every caste other than his caste and wanted his community people to get high post in the society. Thereafter, the six friends formed a group named "Mantra", performing dance, magic or song for advertisement companies. When Raja was made aware of Nandhini's love, he killed her and swept this issue under the rug. The five friends protested to grant justice for Nandhini's death, but the police force stopped the protest and beat up the friends. The five then started a TV show in which they exposed the truth behind Nandhini's death.
When they reach their destination, RK is shocked to see Thyagu and Nandhini together. The friends reveals that Nandhini's death was a sham and Raja committed suicide when the police tried to arrest him for a murder he did not commit. RK then reveals that he is in fact a CBI officer, who was in charge of Raja's case, but RK praises the youngsters for their braveness and hushes up the case.
