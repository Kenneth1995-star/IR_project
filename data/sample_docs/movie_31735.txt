Raghava Rao (N. T. Rama Rao) is a teacher in a government primary school. His wife is Janaki (Anjali Devi). Papa Rao (Nagabhushanam) is the school proprietor. The teacher lives with the commitment to basic values of life. He has two sons Satyam (Rama Krishna) and Venu (Krishnam Raju) and a daughter (T. Padmini). The school children built a house for their teacher with love and affection. After retirement, Raghava Rao has no choice but to live with his children.His ungrateful children sell the house of Raghava Rao and Janaki against their wishes. They separate their father and mother and take care of them by rotation even though the old couple wants to live together.
