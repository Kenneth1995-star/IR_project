Yaaran Naal Baharan

This film tells a story of young hearts seeing each other and falling in love; this falling in love makes their life so different and beautiful. It shows the college life of students, their hostel life, the way they enjoy themselves in the college and the hard work they put in for their studies. Fellow students of Punjab University, Navdeep Singh (Jimmy Shergill) and Harman Kaur (Juhi Babbar), fall in love with each other. Both start to dream of a happy life together. But problems arise when they think of taking their parent's consent before going any further. Harman's father Col. Thakur Singh (Anupam Kher) is a typical Punjabi father with a big ego who does not appreciate the idea of his daughter selecting a groom herself. Deep's Father, Retired Major Balwinder Singh Brar (Raj Babbar), also opposes this alliance, and wants his son to complete his studies before getting married. Balwinder subsequently changes his mind but wants Thakur to adapt to tradition and approach him - but Thakur refuses to do so. The couple then conspire with their fellow students and arrange for their parents to meet on neutral ground. It is this decision that will shatter and change their lives forever. Now both Navdeep and Harmaan are in a dilemma: neither can they go against their parents, nor can they live without each other. How they convince their parents about their relationship without hurting their sentiments is the rest of the story.
