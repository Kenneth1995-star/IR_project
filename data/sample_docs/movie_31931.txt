Nirnayam

A sincere cop, Vamsi Krishna (Akkineni Nagarjuna) is sent undercover along with two other cops. Shivram (Subhalekha Sudhakar) is one of those cops and is a close friend and associate to Vamsi. The three people are sent by Police Commissioner (Giri Babu) to track down a vicious and dangerous criminal named Raghuram (Murali Mohan). Vamsi performs surveillance on Raghuram's daughter Geetha (Amala), by getting into her opposite building's flat in a residential complex, to gather details and whereabouts of her criminal father. Geeta lives with her aunt (Sukumari). When Vamsi, in guise of a telephone department inspector, pursues her and falls in love with Geetha, she reciprocates Vamsi's love interest initially but refuses him after she gets to know the truth that he's a cop and is about to drag her father to prison. The rest of the story is about how Vamsi gets hold of Raghuram through Geetha and what facts he learns about the crime operation of the real criminal Prahlad (Sharat Saxena) who deceives Raghuram who is actually an innocent victim, and in the process how the misunderstanding between Geetha and Vamsi gets cleared up, and how Vamsi banishes the real criminal. The plot of the movie was inspired by the American movie Stakeout.
