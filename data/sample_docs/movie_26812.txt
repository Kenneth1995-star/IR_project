Zindagi Tere Naam

The film starts with an old man, named Mr. Singh (Mithun Chakraborty), narrating a story to an old woman as her memory is slipping day by day. Mr. Singh tells about young lovers Siddharth and Anjali, played by Aseem Ali Khan and Priyanka Mehta, respectively. Anjali is a rich girl, but Siddharth is a poor man's son. Anjali's father (Dalip Tahil) disapproves this affair and takes the daughter away. Dejected Siddharth starts writing letters to her. He writes 365 letters in that entire year, but never hears from Anjali. She believes that he has forgotten her. Years pass and Anjali could not find Siddharth, so she eventually plans to settle down with another man. But destiny had other ideas and the two lovers meet again. As the flashback ends, the film goes back to the elder couple. The old woman realizes that Mr. Singh was telling the story about their own love story, and her memories of the past come rushing back. Mr. Singh is briefly happy, but his wife's memory leaves again.
