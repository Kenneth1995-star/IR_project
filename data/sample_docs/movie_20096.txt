Psychomania

Tom Latham, an amiable psychopath and the leader of a violent teen gang, enjoys riding his motorcycle with his girlfriend and loves his mother. His gang dabble in black magic and call themselves "The Living Dead". In a similar vein, his mother and her sinister butler get their kicks out of holding s√©ances in their home. With her help (and following in his father's footsteps) Tom returns from the dead. One by one, he and his fellow bikers commit suicide with the goal of returning as one of the "undead". One of them fails, but the ones who do return gather together at a secret place called "The Seven Witches" (a circle of standing stones), after which they continue to terrorize the locals.
