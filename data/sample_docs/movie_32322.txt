Okka Magadu

Veeravenkata Satyanarayana Swamy (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is beloved by villagers whose lives were forever changed by his presence. His grandmother, Baby (Simran Bagga), whose husband had dedicated his life to gaining independence for his country, was taken as a prisoner of war and declared Missing In Action. Meanwhile, corrupt doctors, lawyers, and journalists are allegedly killed but their bodies were never found. Suspected of the murders, Swamy is arrested. But an old man named Okka Magadu (Nandamuri Balakrishna) comes forward and claims to have committed the alleged murders. Okka Magadu looks like the older version of Swamy whose sworn enemy is Namboodriyar (Ashutosh Rana)--a politician whose son elopes with a middle-class girl under Swamy's protection.
