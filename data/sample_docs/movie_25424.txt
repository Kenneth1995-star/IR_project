Shatru

There is a village named Haridaspur, where Ashok Sharma (Rajesh Khanna) has been posted as an Inspector in charge. When he arrives in the remote village, he comes to the rescue of a blind man and a widow, and has a fist fight with Nishikant Shah and his men. The immediate next day, Shah finds out that the person with whom his men fought with was Ashok himself. Then to make friendship with Ashok, he goes to pay homage, but Ashok refuses. After a string of incidences, Ashok comes to know of all the bad activities carried out by Nishikant Shah and MLA Gopal Choudary (Om Shivpuri). Ashok then realises he has to help the people of the village from getting exploited by these rich men. Meanwhile, he starts to live in the village as a paying guest at the house of a girl Asha (Shabana Sidique) and also gets fond of an orphan child from the village named Chotu. Ashok then learns that Chotu's father was a loyal farmer who was duped and was killed by Nishikant's men. He even promises Chotu of bringing the culprits to book. Somehow then Shah and his friend Choudhry manage to put Ashok in trouble by fixing a blame on him of killing a man in his custody. Due to this, he then faces a situation where he could lose his job and his good reputation too.
