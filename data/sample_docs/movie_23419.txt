97 Aces Go Places

Con artist Mandy Ling / Li Lai Shan cons a rich triad leader Lui Yu Yeung out of his money and gives it to a convalescent center where her mentally disturbed sister Mandy Li is staying. Earlier, she had also conned another triad leader out of a large sum of money in a poker game causing him to die from a heart attack. The triad leader states in his will that his son Ho Sik must avenge him by killing her with a gun. Ho Sik, who has no interest in guns and violence, hires Chui Cheong, the "Drunken Gun", an ace gunman to tutor him. However, Ho later finds himself falling in love with Mandy and is reluctant to kill her.
