The Iron Maiden

Jack Hopkins (played by Michael Craig) is an aircraft designer with a passion for traction engines and he owns one called The Iron Maiden. His boss (played by Cecil Parker) is eager to sell a new supersonic jet aircraft that Jack has designed to American millionaire Paul Fisher (Alan Hale, Jr.). The first encounter between Fisher and Jack goes badly, and tensions only heighten after Fisher's daughter Kathy (Anne Helm) damages The Iron Maiden, rendering it impossible to be driven solo. Jack is desperate to enter the annual Woburn Abbey steam rally with the machine, but his fireman is injured and unable to participate. When all seems lost, the millionaire himself is won over by Jack's plight and joins him in driving the engine, and the two soon become firm friends.
After an eventful journey, Fisher and Jack reach Woburn Abbey and enter the rally, only for Fisher to injure his back at the last minute. When all seems lost, the sceptical Kathy appears and joins Jack in the engine. The two pilot The Iron Maiden from last place to first, winning the rally; at the finish line, Jack and Kathy embrace and kiss, while The Iron Maiden boils over and explodes. The engine is memorialised when Jack's new jet is named after it.
A Handley Page Victor military bomber is featured in the film as Jack Hopkins' supersonic jetliner. A number of sequences show a Victor in close-up, taxiing, taking off, climbing, flying past and landing with parachute deployed. These scenes were filmed at Radlett Aerodrome.
