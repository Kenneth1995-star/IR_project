Tum Mere Ho

Shiva (Aamir Khan) is blessed with magical snake-charming powers. When he meets Paro (Juhi Chawla) from a nearby village, he falls head-over-heels in love with her. She is also attracted to him. But Paro's father, Choudhry Charanjit Singh, is not pleased with this match, and he hires men to subdue and kill Shiva, all in vain. Little to Shiva's knowledge, during his childhood, his father attacked and killed a shape-shifting snake in order to fulfill his greed, earning the wrath of the snake's powerful mother who promises to exact revenge.
Shiva was bitten, and thought deceased, his family lovingly sent his body afloat a river to which was discovered by Shiva's adoptive Father and revived. How Shiva abuses women and charms snakes.
