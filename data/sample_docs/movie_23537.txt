Throw Down

Karaoke manager and band leader Sze-to Bo (Louis Koo) was a judo expert and former champion who gave up judo a few years ago for unknown reasons and became depressed and an alcoholic. Current judo champion Tony (Aaron Kwok), a competitive fighter, admires Bo and challenges him to a duel. Bo's longtime rival, Lee Ah-kong (Tony Leung), also arrives to challenge Bo for an old unfinished competition. Bo's mentor, Cheng (Lo Hoi-pang), is old and frail and has a dementia ridden son, Ching (Calvin Choi). Wanting to save his judo dojo, which have become a depressing ruins, Cheng also asks his disciple to help him to restore the reputation of his dojo. Mona (Cherrie Ying) is a girl from Taiwan who dreams to become a singer, but was nearly forced into prostitution by her evil manager. She seeks refuge in Bo's karaoke, but thugs manage to chase her there. At this time, Bo can no longer keep his secret and reveals the true reason he gave up judo: he had developed an incurable retinal disease and his vision is gradually declining and currently only having one tenth of his vision left. When Master Cheng dies for his ideals battling on the judo stage and Bo's eyes are nearly becoming blind, Bo's heart is suddenly able to see clearly and his fighting spirit reignites. Bo is determined to deafest all his opponents before seeing the last line of light.
