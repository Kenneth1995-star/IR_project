Mundhanai Mudichu

Parimala (Urvasi) is a mischievous nubile lady who perennially plays pranks on unsuspecting villagers, aided by her gang of preteen children. These often end her and the gang in the panchayat. A widower (K. Bhagyaraj) enters the village with his infant child (Sujitha) to take up the vacant teacher's post in the local school and is immediately pranked by Parimala's gang upon his arrival. Parimala's playful nature transforms into love when she learns that he's a widower. She tries many ways to win the teacher's heart, but fails every time. The teacher believes that a stepmother could not care for his child. As a desperate measure to attain him, Parimala falsely accuses the teacher of molesting her. She even swears upon the teacher's child's life to prove her case at the panchayat. The teacher is then forced to marry her against his wishes. However, he vows never to touch Parimala and to remain forever in celibacy. Parimala relentlessly tries to seduce him by various methods. All her advances are ignored by the husband. Faced with the prospect of never attaining her husband's love, Parimala decides to take the drastic measure of going through a tubal ligation procedure. With this she hopes that her husband will understand that she would never ill treat his son as a stepmother. Shocked upon hearing of Parimala's decision, the husband rushes to the hospital to prevent her from undergoing the procedure. He reaches the hospital to find Parimala unconscious on the bed and assumes she has already undergone treatment. However, the doctor assures him that she has not been operated as he found Parimala to be a virgin and realized that she must have wanted the operation under duress. The story ends with the couple happily united and in the process of planning for another child.
