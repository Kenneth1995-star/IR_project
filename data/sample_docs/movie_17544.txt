Fran

Fran (Noni Hazlehurst) is a likeably vivacious but irresponsible mother of three children, each from a different relationship. She is a product of the welfare system and several foster homes, and of an alcoholic mother and a father she never knew. Passionate about protecting her children from the community welfare authorities, whom she paints as the enemy, she nevertheless fails to do so.
Fran's own self-esteem requires a man in her life and, after the violent end of one relationship, she desperately picks up Jeff (Alan Fletcher), a wayward barman. To secure her relationship with Jeff, she holidays with him, deserting her children, who become wards of the state. It is claimed that Jeff has sexually interfered with Fran's eldest daughter, Lisa (Narelle Simpson).
