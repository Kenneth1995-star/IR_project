Parasite Eve

Kiyomi (Riona Hazuki), the wife of Toshiaki Nagashima (Hiroshi Mikami), is left brain dead after a traffic accident on the day of their first wedding anniversary. Nagashima attempts to make her live again and steals her liver from her corpse. While examining the organ, something from it attacks his assistant Sachiko (Tomoko Nakajima) and turns the assistant into Toshiaki's dead wife. Nagashima later realizes that his dead wife is actually an organization of sentient mitochondria bent on making a new species that will wipe out humanity.
