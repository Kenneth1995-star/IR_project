The Final Judgement

Laced with black humor, and a theatrical parody, The Final Judgment recounts the story of a pilot, Man (Ángel Relló), who is the only survivor of a supposed World War. The film looks at how Man will cope when he has to face God (Andrea Guardiola), Death and Father Time (Manuel Pereiro), in what will be his Final Judgment.
