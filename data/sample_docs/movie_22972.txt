Beware of Pickpockets

Righteous officer Big Nose Pau is ordered to arrest pickpocket Extra Hand. However, each time he was caught, he was released due to a lack of evidence. Although Extra Hand is a tricky man, he is actually a Robin Hood like pickpocket who steals dirty money from the rich to raise seven orphaned children that he adopted. Extra Hand plans to save money to build an orphanage for the children to live in.
Later, Extra Hand learns that his rival, Dog Lice, has robbed many jewels and therefore, Extra Hand planned to steal them from him.
After a major battle with Dog Lice and his gang, Extra Hand was caught by Pau. Although Pau was hesitant to arrest him, Extra Hand decides not to give a tough job for Big Nose and surrenders to him. However, seeing how Extra Hands is doing all this for the orphans, Pau decides to let him go.
