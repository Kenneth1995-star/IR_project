The Mirror

Flatmates Jemma (Jemma Dallender), Matt (Joshua Dickinson), and Steve (Nate Fallows) have decided to purchase a haunted mirror off of eBay in the hopes of winning the James Randi Foundationâ€™s Paranormal Challenge.[5] If they can show proof of supernatural or paranormal activity that can hold up under scientific testing, they will win a million dollars. After receiving the mirror, the trio sets up cameras to record any and all events that occur around the mirror, only to find that this may prove fatal.
