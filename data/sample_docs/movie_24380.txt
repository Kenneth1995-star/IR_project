Thokar

Mohan is a poor blind villager taking care of his ward Radha, who is in love with him. The village tramp, Ramesh (Charlie) sells him a lottery ticket. To Mohan's astonishment, he wins the sweep-stakes but Ramesh wants his share. Ramesh takes Mohan to the city with the intention of getting his eyes treated. In the city, Ramesh deviously gets Mohan married off to a prostitute who is having an affair with Ramesh. When Mohan's eyesight is restored, he sees his wealth diminishing, and an adulterous wife. He takes revenge on Ramesh and his wife. Mohan finally returns to the village and to Radha.
