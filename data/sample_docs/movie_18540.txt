Trouble Brewing

George Formby plays a Daily Sun compositor who wins a large sum at the racing. He collects three ten pound notes. Unable to spend them at the bar, he exchanges them for six fivers. He is paid with counterfeit notes. Formby’s character (George Gullip) then tries to find the criminals. In the process he goes "under cover" as a waiter and a wrestler. Clues suggest the villain is Gullip’s own boss.
