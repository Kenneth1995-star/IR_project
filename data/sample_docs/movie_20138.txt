Our Miss Fred

Shakespearean actor Fred Wimbush is called up during World War II, and is performing in drag, entertaining the troops in France, when the Nazis advance. Unless he continues his disguise in women's clothes, Fred fears he will be shot as a spy. The double entendres and bullets fly as he attempts his escape in the company of the pupils from an English girls' finishing school.[4][5]
