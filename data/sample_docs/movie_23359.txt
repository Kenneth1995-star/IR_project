Last Hero in China

Wong Fei-Hung now has his own school of Kung fu, but its premises have become too small for his numerous students. Two of his disciples succeed in finding an agreement with the owner of a vacant house. The school thus changes location... Unfortunately, Wong Fei-Hung's new school building is next to a "love hotel", which is unacceptable for the Master, although less so for his young students. What's worse, a new general wants Wong gone at any cost, for fear that he will reveal the general's dirty secrets...
