Ratna Deepam

A son in a rich family has gone missing for a long time. A man intrudes into the family feigning as their lost son. He enjoys life with the wealth in the family. However, when the wife approaches him with trust and affection his conscience demands a hearing. Even though he is an imposter he does not want to take advantage of the wife's innocence. Finally it is a victory to the conscience. [4]
