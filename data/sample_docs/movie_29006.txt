Swapna Sundari

Prabhu (ANR) dreamt of a lovely lady, his 'Dream Girl' or 'Swapna Sundari'. He encounters a tribal queen (G. Varalakshmi) while on tour, who falls in love with him, but he rejects her. He finally meets his 'Swapna Sundari' (Anjali Devi) who is actually a Deva Kanya. The love is mutual. She leaves her Godly abode to stay with Prabhu. But an evil Wizard (Mukkamala) finds out that with her help, he can conquer the world and become invincible so he kidnaps her. Prabhu, with the help of the tribal queen, vanquishes the evil Wizard, but the Rani dies. Swapna Sundari and Prabhu live happily ever after.
