 Tarnation

Oscar's dreams of becoming a rockstar are destroyed when she's kicked out of the band and her boyfriend walks out on her, taking their cat, and goes out to a remote cabin in the woods near the ghost town of Tarnation to collect her thoughts. Unbeknownst to her, the satanic master of a demon unicorn seeks Oscar's blood to complete a ritual that will raise the devil from Hell. In order to stop Tarnation from falling upon the world, Oscar must battle a demonic force that can possess anyone in the woods and ultimately face the evil within her own soul.
