Mrittupuri: Kill Zone

Sydney is a dream city for many immigrants, but also it is an ideal place for many international crime lords. Gangsters from Bangladesh, China, Lebanon, Russia have all moved to Australia, to take a piece of the pie, and try to build empire. Among them is the rising Bangladeshi gang Double R. Rajan Rahman (Rahmatullah), the kingpin of Bangladeshi gang is not happy with the way his elder son, Rajib Rahman (Saifullah Sadi) and his crime associate Raja (Arifin Shuvoo), run the business. The situation comes to a head after the timely death of Irish Mob boss’ son Jimmy, which prompts Rajib to leave the country. Raja maintains low profile during this period, and in the process falls in love with bar dancer Layla (Prosun Azad). Upon Rajib’s return, he warns Raja not to get involved with Layla, as he perceives Layla to be his own property. Raja manages to divert Rajib’s mind away, with plans to do business with Lengra Kashem (Taskeen Rahman), a mercenary from Bangladesh. Rajib and Sabbir, his youngest brother, meet Lengra and promise him the East coast territory, leading to their business partnership to become a booming new empire. Eventually, Rahman and his crew fall through on their deal, and remove Lengra from the partnership. Lengra decides to avenge this deception, waiting for the right time to strike.
