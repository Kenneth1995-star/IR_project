After saving Manoranjitham (Vinodhini) from committing suicide in the forest, the kindhearted Siva (Prashanth) brings her home to live in his house, much to the despair of his neighbor Shenbagam (Mounika), who secretly loves him. Things become even more complicated when Siva falls in love with his houseguest and arranges for them to be married, but on the day of the wedding, she mysteriously disappears. Siva comes to know that Manoranjitham is going to die because for her serious health conditions. He finally finds her at her death bed in hospital where she dies.
