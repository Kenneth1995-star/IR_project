Mahakavi Kshetrayya

Varadhayya is an uneducated Shepard who's born into a respected family of pandits. Varadha, however, is blessed with the gift of music. Without giving into his family's wish of being educated, he aspires to be a poet. The story of Varadha takes a life-altering turn when he finds out that the woman he's in love with is already married as a child and is now a widow. Enraged, Varadha vents his anger on the god he believed in and trusted. And as he does so, a worldly saint tells him that there is no light without darkness and guides him to his spiritual destiny. When graced by the presence of Lord Krishna himself, Varadha's outlook on life changes completely. He sets out on a journey that he believes is his destiny. As he travels he writes some of the most inspirational and devotional music that reaches out to all of the Lord's devotees. In his quest to vanquish evil through his music he is faced with many obstacles which he overcomes undeterred.
