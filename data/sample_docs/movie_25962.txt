Kandivli-based Sachidanand Agnihotri is an honest school-teacher, who has always faced problems due to his honesty, first with Poornima School; then in a Government school, and now he has come forward to testify against the sexual assault and murder of a young woman from Worli. Sachidanand points an accusing finger at Nagesh, the son of prominent and influential Jaspal Rana. Sachidanand's family, which consists of his wife, Gayetri, and son, Vishal, attempt in vain to talk him out of testifying. The Police are forced to arrest Nagesh and hold him in a cell. Then the Police, headed by a corrupt Assistant Commissioner of Police, Kamble, attempt to intimidate Sachidanand and follow him everywhere under the pretext of protection. Sachidanand is driven out of his mind, and on the day of the testimony, Nagesh's lawyer, Ashok Pradhan, confuses him to such an extent that Sachidanand kills himself. Vishal, who is being held in prison for assaulting several policemen, breaks out, abducts Nagesh, and then kills Ashok Pradhan. When Kamble comes to Nagesh's rescue, Vishal kills both of them. He then hunts down Jaspal Rana and eventually kills him. In the end, when the court hands Vishal a sentence of 3 years to life imprisonment for which he tells the judge that don't appoint peoples like Jaspal Rana to be ministers so guy like him would not have to take the law into their own hands to deal with ministers like Jaspal Rana.
