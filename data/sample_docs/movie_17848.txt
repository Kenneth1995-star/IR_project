Joffa: The Movie

Joffa Corfe and Shane McRae star as a couple of knockabout handymen with a passion for the Collingwood Football Club. The pair have a knack for attracting trouble which drives the local priest Father Bob McGuire to the point of despair.[3][4] The film portrays Joffa; an ordinary man. The fact he attracts the affection of thousands and the hatred of tens of thousands is just how it is for the man who guides the Collingwood Cheer Squad.
Joffa said that the ordinary people who inhabit his real world "give the movie its heart."[4] People such as Fr. Bob McGuire, Kevin Bartlett and 93-year-old Mavis, who used to attend dances with Ron Barassi's father.
One of the highlights for Australian audiences is hearing Good Old Collingwood Forever sung in Mandarin. Another is hearing the classic Australian food, the Chiko Roll, being explained to a Londoner.[4]
The Australian Council on Children and the Media said that the main messages from this movie are: "Working together as a team is what wins the game."[3] And "Mateship is one of the most important and meaningful things in life."[3]
