River King !The River King

Haddan School, present day. The body of GUS PIERCE a seventeen year old pupil is discovered in a frozen river. Detective ABEL GREY, the local small town cop makes inquiries at the school, is told that Gus was a loner, often depressed and alienated. Everything and everyone points to suicide. Everyone except CARLIN, Gus’s only close friend, who refuses to believe that he would kill himself - strong feelings bourn out of grief; something Abel understands well. He too lost his a loved one to suicide - his brother shot himself when still a boy. Abel has always blamed himself for his brother’s death and lived in a sort of emotional limbo ever since, incapable to forming a proper relationship, living a full life.
Perhaps that is why he takes it upon himself to dig deeper, investigate a little more vigorously than his superiors and Haddan School want. His only ally within the faculty is BETSY, a teacher and amateur photographer, who Abel asks to take forensic pictures of Gus’s room. Pictures which reveal an odd, unexplainable shape sitting on the bed …
When Abel asks others about the photographs he discovers that no one else sees the apparition. In fact only he and Betsy see it., perhaps a symptom of a growing connection between them. Although Betsy is engaged to Haddan’s Principle ERIC HERMAN… Nevertheless she is so overwhelmed by the attraction to Abel that she allows herself to fall into a passionate affair.
