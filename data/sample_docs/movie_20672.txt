The Brylcreem Boys

During World War II, all Allied and Axis service personnel that end up in Ireland are to be interned for the duration of the conflict. Two pilots, a Canadian (portrayed by Campbell) and one of the Luftwaffe (portrayed by Macfadyen), both fall in love with a local Irish girl, played by Butler. The relationship is further complicated by Byrne, who plays the unceasingly vigilant internment camp commander.
