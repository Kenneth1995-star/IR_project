Blind Spot

Laid up in a military hospital waiting for an operation, U.S. Army Captain Dan Adams (Robert MacKenzie), has lost his sight due to a head injury. While his doctors are waiting for his injury to heal before proceeding, Adams is driven off base to a party but is dropped off at the wrong address.
Entering the house, he stumbles over a body and startle the killers Rushford (Ronan O'Casey) and Schrieder (George Pastell). Realising Adams is blind, they knock him out and throw him down a flight of stairs. When Adams revives back in a hospital, his tale of murder seems implausible, as no evidence of a crime is found.
After regaining his eyesight, Adams finds himself framed on a diamond-smuggling charge. He sets out to track down the real thieves, pretending that he is still blind in order to catch them off guard. Encountering aircraft mechanic (Gordon Jackson) and the Brent family, with father (John Le Mesurier) and sister (Delphi Lawrence), Adams realizes that a pilot thought to be dead is really Johnny Brent (Michael Caine) who knows more about the theft and murders. Finally unraveling the mysterious death and smuggling operation, Adams proves his innocence.
