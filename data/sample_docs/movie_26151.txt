Pitaah

A small town in rural India gets to witness a confrontation between two fathers - one a rich, powerful, influential, and cruel Zamindar Thakur Avadh Narayan Singh - who wants the man who filed a police complaint against his two sons to be killed immediately. And the other is Rudra, a poor laborer employed by Avadh, who wants justice when he finds out that his nine-year-old daughter, Durga, has been beaten and brutally raped by Avadh's sons, Bachhu, and Bhola. Amidst this background we have a corrupt doctor, who is willing to change his medical report after he is bribed appropriately; and a Police Inspector, Ramnarayan Bhardwaj, who is willing to drop any charges against Avadh's sons provided he gets his "dues" from the Thakur.
