Meena plays Mahalakshimi, the daughter of a "zamindar" who has lost all his money due to financial troubles; his death leaves Mahalakshimi with a lot of debts (over two lakhs worth). Parthipan is the taxi driver that drives Meena's dead father's corpse back to her hometown. There, the people that Mahalakshimi is now indebted to by Anand Raj who torture Mahalakshimi with cruel words for being unable to pay the debt. Later Parthiban helps her out by giving his taxi in replace to Meena's debt to save her at the point of time. But the twist in the movie is that Parthiban irritates Meena, though unwillingly, to get back his taxi as soon as possible. In the later part Meena will fall in love with Parthiban for his continuous help and support towards Meena. At that time Parthiban's dream girl Actress Rambha comes for shooting in that palace, which makes Meena very angry and jealous as all his attention has been diverted to Rambha. At the end of shooting, Rambha tries to talk Parthiban and Meena and makes them realise their love for each other. But Meena never sees any sign of Parthiban loving her and thus accepts to marry the villain (Anand Raj's) son to get back Parthiban's taxi and settle her debt. Eventually, Parthiban realises his love for Meena and tries to stop the wedding as the groom is also a bad guy who cheated Manorama's daughter. Finally the movie ends on a happy note with Meena getting back all her money and property and leading a happy life with Parthiban.
