Parwana

Kumar Sen (Amitabh Bachchan), an artist by profession is in love with Asha (Yogeeta Bali). Asha wins a trip to Ooty in a dance competition, and falls in love with a wealthy tea plantation owner, Rajesh (Navin Nischol). When Kumar finds out, he goes to Asha's uncle, Ashok Verma (Om Prakash), and demands Asha's hand in marriage. When Mr. Verma refuses, Kumar plots to kill him. The manner in which Kumar plans and executes the murder is regarded as an immensely brilliant and engaging sequence. Kumar boards and exits various modes of transportation to avoid any possibilities of suspicion. He finally kills Mr. Verma and frames Rajesh in the case hoping to win Asha's love. Asha, still in love with Rajesh, promises Kumar to stay with him forever, if he can get Rajesh released from his death sentence. Kumar realises that Rajesh will always remain Asha's love. He writes down his confession, gives it to Rajesh, and commits suicide.
