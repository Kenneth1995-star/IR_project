Mass

Mass (Nagarjuna Akkineni) is an orphan, who bonds well with his landlord's son Adi (Sunil). He is behind a collegian Anjali (Jyothika), who happens to be the daughter of Vizag city's mafia don Satya (Raghuvaran). This restricts her from falling for him, as it would land him in danger, but she finally gives in after some time. She suggests that he ties the knot immediately before her brother Shatru (Rahul Dev) and Satya try separating them. The gangsters, in the process, kill Adi when he tries to stop them when they try separating the lead pair, before their marriage. Mass moves into Vizag and stays in an apartment hiding his identity to take revenge on the mafia dons. Finally, his quest for revenge is completed, and also, he eliminates the antisocial elements in the society by killing them.
