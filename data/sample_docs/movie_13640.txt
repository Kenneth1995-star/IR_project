Dr. T & the Women

Dr. Sullivan Travis (aka "Dr. T.") (Richard Gere) is a wealthy Dallas gynecologist for some of the wealthiest women in Texas who finds his life beginning to fall apart starting when his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), suffers a nervous breakdown and is committed to the state mental hospital. Dr. T's eldest daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), is planning to go through with her approaching wedding despite the secret that she is romantically involved with Marilyn (Liv Tyler), the maid of honor. Dr. T's youngest daughter, Connie (Tara Reid), is a spunky conspiracy theorist who has her own agenda, while Dr. T's loyal secretary, Carolyn (Shelley Long), has romantic feelings for him, which are not mutual. Dr. T's sister-in-law, Peggy (Laura Dern), meddles in every situation she stumbles into, while one woman, Bree (Helen Hunt), a golf instructor, offers him comfort.
