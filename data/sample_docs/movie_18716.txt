Murder in Reverse

After many years serving a prison sentence for a murder he didn't commit, a man tries to seek the truth behind the crime and search out the real culprit. This has complex consequences. His life has been altered as he was taken from his beloved daughter (Clark) who has now grown up not knowing her true identity (Sheridan as an adult). He seeks revenge on his awful degenerate wife (Bouchier) and the man he was accused of murdering.
