The Embezzler

A quiet, respectable henpecked bank cashier learns he has only a few years left to live, and decides to embezzle money from the bank where he works, and enjoy the rest of his days in South America. Discovered in the act, the embezzler flees to an English seaside hotel. There he joins a group of residents including Mrs. Forrest who has problems of her own as she is being blackmailed by a former lover. The embezzler intercedes for her, but at a high cost. [2][3]
