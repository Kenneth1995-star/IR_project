She Couldn't Say No

Wally Turnbull is a partner in a law firm, Trumbull and Johnson, where his trusty secretary Alice Hinsdale is so much in love with Wally that she put aside her own ambitions of becoming an attorney.
Wally is offered a chance to represent a wealthy old man, Eli Potter, in a business transaction. It turns out Potter is being sued for breach of promise by a lady, Pansy Hawkins, who needs a good lawyer. Not knowing Potter has already become Wally's client, Alice pretends to be his partner Johnson and agrees to represent Pansy. So angry is Wally that an irritated Alice goes through with the trial, opposing him in court. Potter's reconciliation with Pansy makes the outcome moot.
