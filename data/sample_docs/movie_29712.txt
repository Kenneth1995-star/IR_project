Nalla Thambi

Raja(Karthik) is a handsome, young man who has completed his MBA from the United States. On returning home, he discovers that all the young women in the city are eagerly waiting in his house, for him to marry one among them. However, though all the girls fail to impress Raja, Seetha (Anuradha)manages to win the heart of his father, Chandrashekhar(T. S. B. K. Moulee), who promises her in marriage to him. Overjoyed, Seetha gears up for the wedding, but has crooked plans in her heart. Raja discovers that she isn't really an admirable person, but is forced to marry her because of his father's coercing.
However his mother(Manorama) secretly helps him elope from home and eventually the wedding is called off. He then runs into Chithra(Radha), a free-spirited girl who is being pressurized by her three freakish "suitor" relatives to marry one among them. She requests Raja to act as her boyfriend so that her quirky suitors will back off in their pointless endeavor. Raja agrees and stays in her house, much to the dismay of her suitors. How they really fall in love and unite despite the hilarious obstacles that come their way, is what makes the movie an out-in-out comedy entertainer.
