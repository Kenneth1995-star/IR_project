Do Phool

Poornima (Naaz), a young orphan girl stays with her Aunt Shankri in a village called Neecha Nagar, at the foothills of Pawan Ghat. Her grandfather, Chacha Sagar (Bipin Gupta), whom she rarely meets, lives a lonely existence atop the hill in a cottage. Shankri is a greedy conniving woman, and instead of having to take care of Poonima, she leaves her with her grandfather. Here Poornima meets a young goatherd, Jaggu (Romi), who brings his goats for grazing every day and returns to his blind mother (Pratima Devi) in Neecha Nagar at sunset. Jaggu and Poornima become friends and develop a close bond. Shankri enters Poornima's life again, as she intends to put her in service so she can earn money. In spite of her grandfather objecting, Shankri puts Poornima to work in Seth Girja Shankar's (Ulhas) house in the city.
Poornima becomes a friend and companion to the Seth's eleven-year-old daughter, Rupa (Vijaya Choudhary). Rupa is wheel-chair bound following a bout of typhoid which left her extremely weak. Soon Rupa and Purnima become friends, which is frowned upon by Rupa's strict governess. Purnima enjoys her life with Rupa learning to read and write, but continues to pine for the free air of the mountains and the greenery. A Doctor is called, who advises the Seth to let Poornima return to Pawan Ghat. Jaggu is ecstatic that Poornima has returned and they wander around the hills again. However, his happiness is short-lived as Rupa, who had been missing Poornima, makes her father send her to Pawan Ghat. Rupa soon starts to feel healthy with the fresh mountain air, wholesome meals, and goat's milk provided to her. One day, Jaggu, in a frenzy of jealousy due to Poornima's close friendship with Rupa, pushes Rupa's wheelchair down the hill. Rupa realises she does not need her wheelchair as she is able to move around freely.
