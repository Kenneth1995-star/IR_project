Over the years, the tale of Wong Fei Hung’s heroism has transformed him into a revered folk hero and is widely portrayed in modern media.

Recognizing Fei’s talent, Lei Gong makes the young warrior his godson and one of his Four Tigers, the most trusted men in the gang. There is more to young Fei than meets the eye and the truth about his past and the ultimate showdown soon unravels.
