Our Little Sister

There are three sisters: 29-year-old Sachi Kouda (Haruka Ayase), 22-year-old Yoshino Kouda (Masami Nagasawa) and 19-year-old Chika Kouda (Kaho). They live in the house of their grandparents in Kamakura, where they grew up after their parents had separated and left them. One day, they receive news of the death of their father whom they haven't seen in 15 years. At the funeral, they meet their 14 year old half-sister Suzu Asano (Suzu Hirose). As there is nobody to take care of her the oldest sister Sachi invites her to live with them.
