Panam Padaithavan

In India of the 60s...
While making to Calcutta, accompanied with his young brother, Balu (Nagesh), for a championship of athl√®tisme, Raja (MGR), an accomplished sportsman, stemming from a rich rustic Tamil family, got acquainted with Shanti (K. R. Vijaya) and with his father, Masilamani, very modest condition.
Between Raja and Shanti, it is love at first sight.
Having taken away (gained) the championship, Raja and Balu meets Rama (Sowkar Janaki) and Uma (Geethanjali), two sisters were accompanied with their fantastically wealthy father.
Between Balu and Uma, it is love, also.
Rama has difficulty in seducing Raja for a very good reason, he thinks only of Shanti.
But things take place not at all as one needs, at least, as Raja would want him.
Indeed, because he refuses the hand of Rama, his father also refuses to give Uma to Balu.
He wants that his two daughters get married to both brothers.
Balu, then, sinks into the alcohol to flood its sorrow.
Informed, Raja makes a terrible decision:
for the happiness of his younger brother, he skips of the one that he loves and resigns to get married to Rama...
