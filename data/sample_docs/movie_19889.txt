Pretty Polly

Miss Polly Barlow (Hayley Mills) decides to leave England and "spend a few months with her wealthy spinster aunt as a traveling companion." While in Singapore, the sudden demise of her aunt (Brenda De Banzie) "leaves her alone to pursue her freedom and explore an arms'-length romance with a local" Indian Singaporean tour guide, Amaz (Shashi Kapoor). "Tender, fun loving, and poetic representation of that transition from youth to young womanhood."[1]
