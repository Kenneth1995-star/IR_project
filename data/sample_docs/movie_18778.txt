Mrs. Fitzherbert

The Prince Regent falls in love with Mrs. Fitzherbert, a Catholic widow, but because of their great social divide, she laughs at his advances. The distraught prince responds with a suicide attempt. Mrs. Fitzherbert feels compassion, and the couple are secretly married. Unfortunately, their secret soon becomes the stuff of gossip and rumour, and when this threatens the relationship between the prince and the king, the prince denies his marriage. The jilted Mrs. Fitzherbert then runs away, and the prince marries the woman to whom he was originally betrothed.[3]
