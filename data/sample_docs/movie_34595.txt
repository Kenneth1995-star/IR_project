A young actress (Min Ji-hyun) commits suicide, and the media responds by lashing out at the rampant sexual exploitation of struggling performers in the entertainment industry. It is revealed that the actress had been brutally taken advantage of by a newspaper mogul, a film director and a broadcast producer. Without the testimony of the deceased victim, the accused stand in court without an accuser, and the courtroom is in a bind when no one dares to testify. Lee Jang-ho (Ma Dong-seok), once a hotshot journalist, now a washed-up web newscaster, engages in search of conclusive evidence to prove the guilt of the perpetrators: the actress' diary. Can he bring the truth to light and the accused to justice?
