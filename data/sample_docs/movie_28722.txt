Anant Kanhere (Akshay Shimpi) is a young lad from a small village in Konkan who goes to Aurangabad to pursue studies. Influenced by Lokmanya Tilak and Vinayak Savarkar's ideologies, Anant decides to contribute to the freedom struggle. Meanwhile, in Nashik, Krushnaji Karve (Shrikant Bhide) and his aides are preparing for an armed rebellion, but it is their mentor Ganesh Savarkar who advices them to wait for the right moment to strike. The root cause of everyone's anger is the collector of Nashik, Officer Jackson who has invited the wrath of people through his actions. And when he orders the arrest of Ganesh, Krushnaji and his group including Anant get into motion to execute Jackson's assassination.
