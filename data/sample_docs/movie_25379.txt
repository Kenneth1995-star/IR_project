Sarfarosh

During the Indian Independence movement, Satyadev, Dharmadhikari and Buddhiram, the three corrupt Indian officials, frame an Indian rebel Jwala Singh, and also have him incarcerated in prison. Many years later, after he completes his sentence, he seeks out the three so he can avenge himself. He will soon find that the only person standing in his way is none other than his very own son.
