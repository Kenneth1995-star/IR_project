Theatre of Blood

After being humiliated (as he perceives it) at a coveted awards ceremony, Shakespearean actor Edward Lionheart (Vincent Price) is seen committing suicide by diving into the Thames from a great height. Unbeknownst to the public, Lionheart survives and is rescued by a group of vagrants. Two years later, on 15 March, Lionheart sets out to exact vengeance against the critics who failed to acclaim his genius, killing them one by one in a manner very similar to murder scenes from Shakespeare's plays.
One critic is murdered by a mob of homeless people.
One critic is electrocuted at a hair salon.
One critic is force fed his dogs, until he suffocates.
One critic is stabbed with a spear and his body dragged away, tied to a horse's tail.
One critic is decapitated while he sleeps.
Lionheartâ€™s adoring daughter Edwina is arrested as the chief suspect (it is revealed early in the movie that she has indeed been helping her father), forcing the actor to reveal himself. In the final drama/murder attempt, Lionheart threatens chief critic Devlin to give him the coveted award or be killed. Devlin refuses, and Lionheart plans to put out his eyes with red-hot daggers, as with Gloucester in King Lear. His contraption gets stuck, however, just as the police arrive to save Devlin. To thwart them, Lionheart sets fire to the theatre, and in the confusion, one of the vagrants kills Edwina with the award statuette, unwittingly casting her in the role of Cordelia. Lionheart retreats, carrying her body to the roof and delivering Lear's final monologue before the roof caves in, sending him to his death.
