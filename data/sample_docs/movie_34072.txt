Come Look at Me

Tatiana, a middle-aged woman, lives with her sick mother Sofia Ivanovna, who has been unable to walk for the last ten years and is very worried that her daughter becomes an old maid. The mother imagines that this is purely her fault - being the desire to keep Tatiana beside her.
A week before the New Year, Sofia Ivanovna declares that she will soon die and she would like to leave with the assurance that her daughter is happy. The light goes out in the apartment and there is a knock at the door. On the threshold there is an unfamiliar man with a bouquet of roses and champagne. It turns out that he was ready for a date with his young lover and has mistaken the house. Tatiana comes up with the idea to present this man as her fianc√©. He, not wanting to make a scandal with the elderly woman, decides to play along with Tatiana. Calling his sweetheart, he lies that he is late at work, forgetting that she has caller ID. When the girl calls back, she creates a scandal. Igor leaves.
Trying to break out of her deception, Tatiana persuades a saleswoman from the vegetable aisle to play the role of a suddenly found daughter, whom she allegedly disowned at the maternity hospital. This scene occurs in front of Igor, who decided to continue his casual acquaintance.
Evening of the New Year. Mother insists that Tatiana spend the holiday with Igor, and she leaves for the winter city almost to nowhere. In the street there is an unexpected meeting with the "daughter" who is dressed up as Santa Claus on crutches. Together they come home, where they find Sofia Ivanovna, who has risen to her feet. In tune with the striking chimes and clad in the suit of yet another Santa Claus, Igor appears on the landing and proposes to Tatiana.
