Bakit Lahat ng Gwapo may Boyfriend?

Kylie, a wedding planner, who has had a string of boyfriends. Unfortunately for her, all of them have turned out to be gay including Benj, her first boyfriend. On the upside, some of them have become good friends. In fact, Benj became one of her best friends, on top of being a business partner in a wedding planning venture. Because of her "luck" with men, she comes to believe that she will never find a real guy. Everyone she will get attracted to will eventually come out as gay. This theory gets put to the test when she meets Diego, Benj's childhood best friend and secret love, with whom she gets easily smitted. Egged on by Benj, Kylie sets out to prove that she's right again that Diego, who is engaged to be married to a beautiful and classy lady, is indeed another closet case.[6]
