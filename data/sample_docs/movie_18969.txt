The Franchise Affair

In a quiet English town, schoolgirl Betty Kane (Ann Stephens) claims that the owners of an isolated house, spinster Marion Sharpe (Dulcie Gray) and Marion's mother (Marjorie Fielding), kidnapped and beat her. The police believe Betty's story, but local lawyer Robert Blair (Michael Denison), a bachelor, is sceptical. Risking ostracism from the community, Blair quietly sets about proving the innocence of the two women.
