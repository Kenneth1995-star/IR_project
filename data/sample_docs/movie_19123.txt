Adventure in the Hopfields

After accidentally smashing her mother's prized china dog, little London girl Jenny (Mandy Miller) leaves her mother a note, and sets off from home to make the money to buy a new one. Travelling by train, she follows her friends family to Kent to earn money hop picking in the countryside. She eventually makes enough cash, but it is then stolen by other children. Jenny chases after the kids to an old mill, but the thieves capture her and tie her up. When lightning strikes the decaying mill and sets it on fire, the children return to rescue Jenny, but just in the nick of time.
