Lady L

As she approaches her 80th birthday, the sophisticated and still attractive Lady Lendale recounts to her biographer, Sir Percy, the story of her life.
Fleeing her humble origins in Corsica, she traveled to Paris, where she found work in a brothel. There she falls in love with a thief and anarchist, Armand, and becomes pregnant by him. But before he can use a bomb to assassinate a Bavarian prince, she meets Lord Lendale, who is so enchanted by the young woman that he offers to overlook Armand's activities if she will agree to marry him.
Lady L becomes a woman of means, moving in high society, and together she and Lord Lendale raise a large family. In the end, however, she reveals their secret: that she has continued to be the lover of Armand, who has fathered all their children while posing as the family's chauffeur.
