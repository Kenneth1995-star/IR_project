Do Shikaari

Seeking the treasure located in Solomon's Mines in the heart of Africa, Zorro (Amjad Khan) abducts and holds Sunita's (Rekha) father as ransom, and forces her to journey to Africa, to find the treasure. She does travel to Africa, and meets with Ranjeet (Biswajeet) and asks him for help to locate her missing brother. Ranjeet agrees to do so, and they commence their travel, little knowing what awaits them in the deep jungle full of wild beasts; hostile tribesmen; a seemingly endless and barren desert; not to speak of treachery and greed of people from their own group.
