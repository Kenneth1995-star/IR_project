Ramesh (Jeetendra) starts managing the office of an industrialist who strongly suspects his relatives to be looting him. Ramesh finds the culprit and keeps a tight leash on everything happening in the office, thereby earning the wrath of the industrialist's relatives. Ramesh and Nisha (Jaya Prada) the industrialist's daughter initially find themselves at loggerheads, but eventually, fall in love with each other. The industrialist is happy about this development until he sees Ramesh cheating on his daughter. He fires Ramesh the very same day. The industrialist is murdered and Nisha also sees Ramesh in her house that same night. Ramesh is dragged to court and is shortly framed for murder. Nisha is upset, and the ill-intentioned relatives start closing their net around her, forcing her to marry Shakti Kapoor (the son of two of the industrialist's relatives). In the meantime, the grief-stricken Ramesh meets another person named Gangu (also Jeetendra) in jail who looks exactly like him. Together Ramesh and Gangu plan to punish the culprits and set the record straight.
