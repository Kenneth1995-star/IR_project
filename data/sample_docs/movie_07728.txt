The Girl Hunters

Ever since his loved and lovely assistant Velda has gone missing, private detective Mike Hammer has been drinking steadily. For seven years he hasn't been on a case, but that changes when his longtime pal from the police, Capt. Pat Chambers, asks his assistance on a job.
Hammer is needed to talk with Richie Cole, a dying sailor who refuses to speak with anybody else. According to federal agent Art Rickerby, not only has Richie been shot by the same gun recently used to kill a politician, he is actually an undercover federal agent.
The trail leads to Laura Knapp, the late senator's widow. She is beautiful and she is seductive, but Hammer does not trust her, even making sure a shotgun that ends up in her hands is rigged by mud blocking the two barrels to backfire on anybody who pulls the trigger. Laura fires the shotgun at him, and Hammer gets his answer.
