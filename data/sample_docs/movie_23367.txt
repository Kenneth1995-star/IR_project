Tom, Dick and Hairy

Tom Chan, Dick Ching and his older cousin Hairy Mo live in the same tenement building but each of their love life is different. Tom and his girlfriend Joyce are totally harmonic, but nonetheless love have become feelings. During one time looking for lust in a nightclub, Tom meets a stunning PR girl, Cat. The two fall in love with each other but since Tom's weeding date is getting close, he needs to make a tough decision. Dick is a playboy who often pursues sex without love. Sometimes at night without a pursuing object, Dick would spend the night with Wai-fong. At this point, Tom's younger sister, Pearl, returns to Hong Kong from the US and Dick feels lost of Pearl's passion. On the other hand, Dick realizes that he had always loved Wai-fong but she has gone elsewhere when he wants to express his love. Hairy is a bachelor who meets a divorce man Michelle, who turns out to be a homosexual man. Later, Hairy dates a girl named Francis who strikingly resembles his idol Vivian Chow, something unexpectedly for this unbearably lonely man.
