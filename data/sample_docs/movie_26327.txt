Sathyanarayan Murthy (Chiranjeevi) is a rough but kind man who lives in Amalapuram with his niece, mother, sister and her husband. Sathya and his niece Lavanya (Shriya Sharma) share a special bond and are the best of friends. One day, Lavanya falls off the swing in a park and dies.
Sathya later finds out that she has been shot by gun dealer Pasupathi (Arbaaz Khan), who lives in Los Angeles, USA. Sathyanaraya wants to go the US to avenge his niece's death but could not get a permanent visa as he was uneducated. Meanwhile, he meets and falls in love with Shilaza (Sameera Reddy), but marries Neelu (Bhoomika) as she was a green card holder, then goes to California, USA with her and kills Pasupathi.
