Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan

Arvind Desai (Dilip Dhawan) is the only son of a rich businessman (Shriram Lagoo), who deals in luxury handicrafts and products. His feelings for his father are mixed. While he hates the latter's dominating nature, he admires his power and lack of scruples. He has long discussions on art and politics with a Marxist friend Rajan (Om Puri), is seeing his father's secretary Alice (Anjali Paigankar) and sometimes he visits a prostitute, Fatima. Much against his wishes, his marriage is arranged to a girl from a high-class family that has just returned from Paris, much to the dismay of Alice's mother, who realizes that Alice was a pastime for Arvind and nothing more. Suresh Oberoi has done a cameo in this movie.
Arvind has no goal, throughout he's searching for something and is severely dissatisfied.
The film ends with the craftsman making carpets.
