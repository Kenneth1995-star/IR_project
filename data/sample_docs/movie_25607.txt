Love

Jailed as a juvenile for killing his abusive father (Sudhir Kumar), who is responsible for his mother's suicide, Prithvi (Salman Khan) is unable to stand any atrocity. He meets Maggie Pinto (Revathi Menon) and after a few chance meetings, they both fall in love. Maggie takes Prithvi to meet her parents, but they reject him after learning about his criminal past. When Maggie and Prithvi persist, Maggie's mother, Stella Pinto (Rita Bhaduri), calls the police and has Prithvi jailed. Guruji (Amjad Khan) comes to Prithvi's aid and bails him out. Prithvi and Maggie continue their courtship, but Stella finds out and intervenes, sending goons to attack Prithvi, during which Maggie is injured. How this affects everyone close to her is the crux of the story.
