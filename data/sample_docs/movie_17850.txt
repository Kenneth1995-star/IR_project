Oranges and Sunshine

The film is based on the true story of Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham who uncovered the scandal of "home children",[3] a scheme of forcibly relocating poor children from the United Kingdom to Australia and Canada.[4]
Margaret reunites estranged families, who are situated in Australia and the U.K., and brings worldwide attention to the cause.
Deported children were promised oranges and sunshine but they got hard labour and life in institutions such as Keaney College in Bindoon, Western Australia.[5] Many were given to the Congregation of Christian Brothers, where they were repeatedly raped.[6]
