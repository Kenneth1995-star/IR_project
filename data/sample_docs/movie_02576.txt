The Great Man Votes

Ivy League scholar Gregory Vance descends into an alcoholic abyss after the death of his wife. He ends up barely able to hold a job, and a night watchman's job at that.
Vance's two children, Joan and Donald, are exceptionally intelligent and benefit from his tutoring. But they are bullied at school by other students and their father risks losing custody of them if he cannot change his ways. New teacher Agnes Billow is able to help Vance become more like the man he used to be, particularly after a political bigwig tempts him ethically with a bribe of a better job in exchange for Vance's vote.
