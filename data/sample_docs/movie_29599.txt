Johnny

Archana (Sridevi) is a popular singer, and Johnny (Rajinikanth) is her ardent fan. Johnny is a con-man who does petty-thefts (only on the greedy OLones) to close the loan taken by his father. Johnny never misses Archana's concerts and she notices this. A tender love develops between the two, but Johnny is guarded in accepting Archana's love due to his not-so-clean background. But one day Johnny accepts the love of Archana when she proposes to him. Meanwhile, Vidyasagar (Rajinikanth), a barber and look-alike of Johnny, lives a lonely life with his assortment of pet animals. He falls for Bhama (Deepa) another loner and they both plan to marry. Vidyasagar notices his lover's infidelity and kills her in rage. Knowing about his look-alike Johnny and knowing that he is wanted by the police, he tries to pass on the murder charge to him and gives up on women as well looking at them in low light. Both of them are chased by police, Johnny hides in a forest, and Vidyasagar tries to pass off as Johnny by taking refuge in Archana's house. Archana gets hurt by the curt behaviour of Vidyasagar(who is in the guise of Johnny) and she is confused on the change in Johnny's behaviour. Finally, Vidyasagar realizes his folly, understands not all women are same as well as their love and unites the lovers by getting caught in the police, taking responsibility for Johnny's crimes included.
