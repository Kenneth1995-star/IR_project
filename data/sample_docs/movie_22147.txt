Niagara Motel

Niagara Motel features its namesake and the ongoings amongst the inhabitants of the motel and linked Riverside Grill coffee shop located in Niagara Falls. The characters include the owner and his daughter (Andrei and Fitch), their newly pregnant waitress (Dhavernas) being recruited to star in low budget porn videos, a young couple (Friel and Holden-Reid) with a criminal past struggling to recover their child from social services, and a middle class husband and wife (Keleghan and Crewson) in a marriage that is disintegrating in near-record time - all led by a drunken motel caretaker (Ferguson).
