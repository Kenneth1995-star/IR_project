In Her Place

Inspired by Korean culture's strong stigma against adoption,[1] the film stars Gil Hae-yeon and Ahn Ji-hye as a mother and daughter living on a farm in Korea. When the teenage daughter becomes pregnant, a woman (Yoon Da-gyeong) arrives from Seoul to propose a secret adoption, conditional on her staying with them for the duration of the pregnancy so that she can hide the adoption when she returns to Seoul after the baby's birth.
