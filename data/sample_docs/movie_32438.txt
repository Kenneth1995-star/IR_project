Saradagaa Kasepu

Ranga Babu (Allari Naresh) is a driver whose childhood friend is Srinivas (Srinivas Avasarala). Srinivas is from a rich family and lives in the U.S. The story takes a turn when Srinivas comes to India to get married and his parents (Jeeva, Sana) want him to tie the knot with Raja Rao's (Ahuti Prasad) daughter Manimala (Madhurima) who lives in a different place. However, Srinivas has a condition that he must know about the girl's character before marriage. For this, he switches places with Ranga Babu. As expected, misunderstandings and confusions arise. What happens from there forms the rest of the story.
