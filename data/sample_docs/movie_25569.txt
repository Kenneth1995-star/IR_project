Kafan

Four friends want to be immortal by way of supernatural power and they ask for this from Tantrik (Black magician). The tantrik tells them to bring a virgin girl for rituals. Two of them find one girl, but they rape her till she faints and take her to the Tantrik. While the ritual starts, the girl transforms to an evil soul and enters into the body of another girl. She kills the Tantrik first and starts killing the friends.
