Zombi Kampung Pisang

The story starts when Husin is asked by few village boys on his way home to hang out with them during their guitar playing sessions. Husin decides to join them. Eventually they get spotted and is given a scolding by an elder named Pak Abu, who was on his way back home from the mosque after the Isyak prayers.
Halfway through his scolding of them, Pak Abu suddenly freezes in motion and falls, at which point Husin and the other boys carry Pak Abu home. Mat Karen calls the head of the village to Pak Abu's house. Things turn chaotic when Pak Jabit, the village head, is also knocked out. They then decide to call the village's medical assistant Sofi. Sofi checks both Pak Abu and Pak Jabit and declares them both already dead. While they discuss what happened, Pak Abu's daughter Muna screams in horror - the bodies of Pak Abu and Pak Jabit have somehow disappeared.
Shocked with the incident, Husin and Sofi rush to their community centre and drum on the old bedok to gather the villagers. After they inform the villagers of these events, some of the villagers start to speculate of the paranormal activities that might be happening around them. Their fears soon become a reality: zombies start to appear all across the village, the victims encountering them with hilarious results.
