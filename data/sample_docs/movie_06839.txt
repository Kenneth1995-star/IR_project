The Man Who Turned to Stone

Two hundred years ago, a group of unethical doctors learned to extend their lives by draining the vitality of others. Without such transfusions, they begin to slowly petrify. They become the medical staff of doctors at a girls' reform school, assuring a steady supply of vital young bodies to feed upon. However, two outsiders sent to the school, Dr. Jess Rogers (Hudson) and social worker Carol Adams (Austin), become suspicious of the unusual number of otherwise healthy inmates dying of heart failure or suicide. They begin a quiet investigation, eventually exposing the doctors and their crimes and saving future victims.
