Vinyas (Santhosh) working as an architect is shown a pink-slip from his employer due to the huge recession in economy. With the help of his friend Hanumanthu (Sharan), Vinyas sets up his own office and hires a brilliant interior architect Drushti (Aindrita). The team make some high-profile work and get popular within few days. Meanwhile, he develops love towards Drushti to which she rejects as she already was in love with Jeevan (Aadarsh). Seeing the developments, Drushti quits the company and moves out with Jeevan and sets up her own business. Dejected by love, Vinyas begin to lose interest in his business and incurs huge loss. Later, he comes back to reality and revamps his business to get success again. In one of the architectural conferences, he meets Drushti and Jeevan again doing well for themselves and getting 2nd place at the competition. As a courtesy, Vinyas rejects his first prize and stages the sequence as to award Drushti the prize in his place. He walks out in deep satisfaction that he sacrificed with good intention.
