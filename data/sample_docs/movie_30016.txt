Valli

Valli (Priya Raman) returns to her village after studying for 15 years in Madras. Her cousin Harihar celebrates her arrival back to the village. He was in love with Valli since childhood days, but she has changed after she went to study in the city. She is no more in love with him. She falls in love with a city guy called Shekar (Sanjay) who comes to the village with his friends for hunting. Shekar has sex with her promising to marry her, but cheats her and he escapes to the city. It is then found out that he is the only son of the chief minister of the state. Later, after wide-spread protests Shekar is brought back by her cousin. Instead of marrying the city guy she kills him for cheating her. She is put in jail for 10 years. Finally when she returns home, she finds her wedding hall ready with pomp and fun for her marriage with her cousin. Her marriage is arranged by Veeraiya Valliyappan (Rajinikanth) and Shiva (Vadivelu), who know her terrible past. She thanks them for wholeheartedly helping her.
