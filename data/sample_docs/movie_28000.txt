Sankaranarayanan was a local press baron. He and Anthony reported through the newspapers, the atrocities/rape faced by the female plantation workers due to the local police. Seeking revenge, the 3 police officers involved- Nambiar, Aravind and Thomas Sebastian rape and murder Sankaranarayanan's wife and daughter and falsely implicate him in their murders. Sankaranarayanan reveals to Bala that he is his son and they must take revenge against Nambiar, Aravind and Thomas Sebastian. Meera (Nambiar's daughter) is held captive by Sankaranarayanan. Bala is against killing Meera since it was her father who had raped/murdered his sistor and Meera must not be punished. Meera escapes the clutches of Sankaranarayanan with the help of Bala. However while escaping Meera slips and hits a stone leading to her death.
Sankaranarayanan and Bala murder Nambiar and Aravind but their attempt to kill Thomas Sebastian is foiled by SP Siddharth Mahadev. However Sona Nair murders Thomas Sebastian. It is later known that Sona Nair is the wife of Sankaranarayanan.
