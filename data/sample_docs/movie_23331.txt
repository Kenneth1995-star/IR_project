92 Legendary La Rose Noire

Children's novel writer Butterfly Wong (Maggie Shiu) is unsuccessful in her career and relationship. One time, while attempting suicide, a couple nearby mistaken her for a robber. Wanting to return items left behind by the couple, Butterfly heads to the couple's home, accompanied by her friend, Chow Wai-kuen (Teresa Mo). There, they witness an illegal drug trade, followed by a mutual slaughter among the drug dealers. In order to avoid police suspicion, Butterfly imitates Black Rose, a vigilante character who appeared in 1960s Hong Kong films, and left a note behind. As a result, The real Black Rose's apprentices, Piu-hung (Fung Bo Bo) and Yim-fan (Wong Wan-sze), kidnap Butterfly. Detective Keith Lui (Tony Leung), who has a crush on Butterfly, proceeds to rescue her. However, Piu-hung and Yim-fan mistaken Keith for their ex-lover and locks him up as well.
