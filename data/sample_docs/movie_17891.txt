 Goddess

Elspeth Dickens (Laura Michelle Kelly) dreams of finding her "voice" despite being stuck in an isolated farmhouse with her twin boys (Phoenix and Levi Morrison). A webcam she installs in her kitchen becomes her pathway to fame and fortune, making her a cyber-sensation. Through singing her funny sink-songs into the webcam, Elspeth becomes a cyber-sensation.
While her husband James (Ronan Keating) is off saving the world's whales, Elspeth is offered the chance of a lifetime. But when forced to choose between fame and family, the newly anointed internet goddess almost loses it all.[1]
