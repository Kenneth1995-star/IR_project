Ride Lonesome

Bounty hunter Ben Brigade (Randolph Scott) captures wanted outlaw Billy John (James Best), who brags that his brother Frank (Lee Van Cleef) will never allow Brigade to take Billy John to justice in Santa Cruz County, AZ. AIong the way, Brigade comes to the rescue of a woman, Carrie Lane (Karen Steele), whom he and a pair of unwelcome new partners, gunmen Sam Boone (Pernell Roberts) and his friend Whit (James Coburn), take along toward safety. But Brigade knows that the reward on Billy John's head is the real motive behind Sam's and Whit's arrival, and that outlaw leader Frank won't be far behind.
