Kuchibiru ni uta o

Yuri Kashiwagi, a beautiful and talented pianist suddenly returns to her hometown in Goto Islands. She relieves her friend Haruko, who is on maternity leave, as the advisor for the school chorus. The choir aims to take part in NCon, a choir contest organised by Japanese national broadcaster NHK. However, her arrival attracts many male members to the choir. This creates friction within the previously all-female choir.
