Vidyapathi

A young man tells his parents that he will marry only after wooing and loving a girl. He sees an ad in a matrimonial column and goes to meet the girl. On his way he is robbed. He is left behind only with a loin cloth. A fake sadhu finds him and take with him. The fake Sadhu makes the young man into a yogi. In the meantime, a zaminder who has an affair with a devadasi (dancer), neglects his wife and daughter. The Sadhu introduces the yogi (the young man) to the young woman with an idea for making money. But the young man and woman fall in love with each other. After many twists and turns, they both marry.[3]
