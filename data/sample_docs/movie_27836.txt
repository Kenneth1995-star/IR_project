Pulival Kalyanam

Harikrishnan (Jayasurya) is the adopted younger brother of Karunan (Lal). When Karunan loses his right hand in an accident, Hari at a young age takes responsibility of his family. Karunan's sister, Sreekutti is in love with the son of Paramanandam (Jagathy Sreekumar), who is unscrupulous and demands a huge dowry for the marriage to be made possible. To make this marriage possible Harikrishnan and Karunan take a loan from a financier (Salim Kumar) and invest it in a fireworks business, only to lose it completely in a fire.
Simultaneously, Harikrishnan gets his phone muddled with Ganga (Kavya Madhavan) on account of both the models being the same. Ganga's father Raghavendra Sett (Lalu Alex) is the boss of Paramanandam. Hari and Ganga have loads of comical misunderstandings before falling in love and deciding to get married. Of course this is not acceptable to Raghavendra Sett, and he puts obstacles in their way. The story is whether or not Hari and Ganga can overcome these obstacles.
