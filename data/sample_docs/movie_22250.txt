This Movie Is Broken

Bruno wakes up in bed next to Caroline, his long-time crush. But tomorrow she's off for school in France, and maybe she only granted this miracle as a parting gift for her long-time friend. So tonightâ€”tonight is Bruno's last chance. And tonight, as it happens, Broken Social Scene, her favourite band, is throwing a big outdoor bash. Maybe if Bruno, with the help of his best pal Blake, can score tickets and give Caroline a night to remember, he can keep this miracle alive.
