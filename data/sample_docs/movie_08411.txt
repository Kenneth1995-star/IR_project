Bambi Meets Godzilla

The opening credits scroll over an animated image of the character Bambi serenely grazing while the Call to the Dairy Cows from Rossini's opera William Tell (1829) plays in the background. After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzilla's giant foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of The Beatles' "A Day in the Life" slowed down to half speed). After a moment, the closing credits appear alongside held image of Godzilla's foot atop Bambi.
Only 12 of the film's 90 seconds of running time are devote to the story's single gag. The bulk of the running time is consumed in the opening credits, all of which name Marv Newland, including crediting Newland's parents for "producing" Marv.[2] The closing credits give grateful acknowledgement to the city of Tokyo "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film".
