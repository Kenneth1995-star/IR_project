Brother of Bommali

On a rainy night, twins are born in a local government hospital. The older twin is a boy, Ramakrishna ’Ramky’ (Allari Naresh) and the younger is a girl, Lakshmi ’Lucky’ (Karthika Nair). Ramky is calm, seeking stability and focus while his sister Lucky is a streetwise tomboy who has grown up learning karate.
The children grow up and Ramakrishna becomes an interior designer; content with a safe career and the approval of his family. Lakshmi grows up into a wild and headstrong young woman.
Ramky falls in love with Shruthi (Monal Gajjar); another interior designer who works for a rival business. Shruti ends up working in Ramky’s firm and after a series of incidents, returns his love, but his father declares he can only marry if he finds a husband for his sister first.
Lucky confesses that she is in love with Harsha (Harshvardhan Rane) and stubbornly insists that he is the only man she will ever marry. From that point on, the entire cast starts doing everything possible to get Lucky married to Harsha.
