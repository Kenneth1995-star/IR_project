Kirathakudu

Chiru plays a rather unusual role: He hates his father to the core and does not support him even when he is being destroyed. Chakravarthy (Kongara Jaggaiah), who is a CBI officer, who is nominated to the Interpol and his son Charan (Chiranjeevi) is a reputed sportsman, but there is no love between them. Charan spends his life with friends and alcohol to overcome his loneliness.
Dharmateja (Gummadi Venkateswara Rao) is an honest police officer. His daughter Swetha (Suhasini Maniratnam) who is doing research in criminology gets acquainted with Charan. Swetha falls in love with Charan during this process and changes Charan into a caring person.
Chakravarthy is trying to eliminate the notorious criminal gang led by Snake (Kannada Prabhakar).
Meanwhile, Snake and his men, who are enemies of Chakravarti, try every possible method to destroy him and falsely incriminate him in a murder case. Police are after Chakravarti and Charan doesnâ€™t care about helping his father out.
In the end, Chakravarthy is kidnapped by Snake but Charan with help from Swetha rescues him and hands Snake over to the police.
