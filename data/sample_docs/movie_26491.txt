Mr. White Mr. Black

Gopi, a simpleton, arrives in Goa from A hamlet(small village) in India Hoshiyarpur, to hand over a tiny piece of land to his dad's friend son Kishen, which was his father’s last wish. Kishen, now a conman, swindles people with a little help from his accomplice, Babu, to earn enough money to educate his sister Divya who’s studying in London. When Kishen gets to know that Gopi has reached Goa to meet him, he avoids him. Only because he thinks that he is a gang member then when he finds out the truth. he doesn’t want to give up his flourishing business and travel to Hoshiyarpur just to take possession of a measly piece of land! However, Gopi is adamant to take Kishen back and is aided by Tanya(whom he meets later in the movie), daughter of the owner of KG Resorts. Little do they realise that three girls are staying at KG Resorts with stolen diamond worth crores. When Kishen, Babu and everyone else learn about this they all make a mad rush for KG Resorts. Gopi finds himself a part of the gang.
