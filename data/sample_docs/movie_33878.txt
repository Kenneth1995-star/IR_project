Kamen Rider Ghost: The 100 Eyecons and Ghost's Fated Moment

When Takeru and his friends celebrate Kanon's 15th birthday, the sky suddenly changes its color. Riding on the Iguana Ghostriker, Takeru, Makoto, and Alain investigate this phenomenon. What they discover is a giant Eyecon in the sky emitting a strange light, which sucked them in! Because of this, they were transported in a village where heroes from the ages are living together.[4]
