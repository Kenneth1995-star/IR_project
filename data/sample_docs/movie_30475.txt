Ezhumalai

Ezhumalai (Arjun) leads a peaceful life as a dance master in the village. Anjali (Gajala) falls in love with him before learning that he has a son and that his wife Lakshmi (Simran) is dead. She now wishes to marry him but faces competition from Lakshmi's sister Sandhya (Mumtaz), who also wishes to wed Ezhumalai. Anjali is the daughter of Nagalingam (Ashish Vidyarthi) from a neighboring village. When she reveals this fact to Ezhumalai, she learns that Ezhumalai and her father are sworn enemies and that it was her father who had killed Lakshmi.
