Learning to Drive

Learning to Drive is about the unlikely friendship that develops between two very different New Yorkers. Wendy is a sharp-tongued book critic[3] whose husband just left her, inspiring her to embrace her independence and learn how to drive. Her teacher, Darwan, is a gentle Indian Sikh driving instructor with an impending arranged marriage. As Darwan teaches Wendy how to drive, they both learn valuable lessons about relationships, life, and the value of friendship.[7]
