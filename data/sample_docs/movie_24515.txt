Parakh

The central character is the Post Master who is given a mysterious cheque for ₹500,000 to be given to anyone who will use it to benefit the people of the village. There is a postman who pretends to be lame and is secretly rich and may have sent the cheque. Then there is the postmaster's wife, who is sick and would rather use the money to cure her illness, and his beautiful daughter Seema (played by Sadhana), who has a crush on the village school master. Meanwhile, all the greedy and influential people of the village are busy trying to convince everybody why they are most deserving of the money; they include the village priest, the landlord, the money lender, the village doctor and the school master, who is by far the most respected. They all decide democracy is the best means and decide to hold an election where the winner gets the money. The movie is a satirical look at democracy through various twists and turns in the plot, interweaved with a simple love story.
