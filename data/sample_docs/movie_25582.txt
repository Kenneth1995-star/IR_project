Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen

The movie has a lot of poetry within itself. Anita Kanwar is an unconventional girl lacking confidence. All people around her including her father and brothers keep advising her "how she should be". Then, a magician who can bring rain comes to their lives. He helps her to realize the potential of believing. He brings back beauty and confidence to her. Now, she realizes altogether a different life, just because of believing or changing perception.
