ABCD

Anand (Shaam), an MBA-chartered accountant, runs in search of a job. He stays in the house of an old Brahmin whose daughter Chandra (Sneha) returns home following the death of her husband (Saravana Subbiah), who had been torturing her since their wedding. She slowly gets attracted towards Anand, for he shows love and affection towards her.
Meanwhile, Anand comes across Bharathy (Nandana) in a bus who misplaces his academic certificates. Bharathy is a woman with revolutionary ideas and looks after her whole family. A sequence of events brings them close leading to Bharathy developing love towards him. Meanwhile, Anandh comes across one Divya Daisy (Aparna Pillai). She is an orphan brought up by a church and goes to find a job herself and settles in life all out of her own efforts. Anand rescues her from an accident and rushes her to a hospital. Over a period of time, they become very close friends eventually leading to Divya opening her heart to Anand. Caught in a tight corner, who Anand decides to marry forms the rest.
