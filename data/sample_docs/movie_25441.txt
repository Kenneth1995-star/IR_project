Hukumat

Arjun Singh (Dharmendra) is a dare-devil upright cop who believes in dealing strongly with criminals. D.I.G. Khan (Shammi Kapoor) does not agree with his ways and there is always a disagreement between the two. Arjun is sent on a special mission to Shanti Nagar, which in under the police scanner due to some shady activities going on there. On reaching Shanti Nagar, Arjun sees that it is ruled by a wealthy businessman, Deen Bandhu Deena Nath aka D.B.D.N., who has very high contacts. He has terrorised the town with the help of his convoy of uniformed men who kill the citizens at will. Arjun realises that D.B.D.N is none other than Mangal Singh, the corrupt police officer who had killed Arjun's father (Parikshit Sahni) when Arjun was a child. Arjun gets thirsty for D.B.D.N's blood, but is stopped by D.I.G Khan. But when D.B.D.N kills Arjun's young son (Jugal Hansraj), Arjun, with the help of D.I.G Khan sets out to overturn the evil rule (Hukumat) of D.B.D.N
