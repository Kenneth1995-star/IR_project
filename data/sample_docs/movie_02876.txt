Maryland

After her husband dies, wealthy Charlotte Danfield sells off his entire stable of horses and forbids son Lee to ride again.
He remains close to trainer William Stewart, though, and upon returning from Europe where he has been sent to school, Lee decides to ride William's horse Cavalier in the Maryland Cup over his mother's objections.
