Ammaye Navvithe

Sundaram (Rajendra Prasad), an unemployed guy to the village of Talamanchi, ruled by Seshadri Naidu (Ranganath), a feudal-era chieftain of his tribute. There's a Hindi lecturer post vacant in the college of Naidu and Sundaram wants that. Naidu is a glorified ruffian, and his protectiveness towards women actually makes it seem like a vice. He banishes people from the village for helping young lovers unite, makes college students start with an oath every day that all women are their sisters, pronounces the death sentence on men who attempt to outrage women, and generally makes himself look like he was molested as a kid.
Sundaram gets the job by some clever manipulation and then does the unthinkable he starts wooing Sireesha (Bhavana), a much intelligent girl, the daughter of Naidu. Whoever woos her deserves her, and you lose your last shred of sympathy for Sundaram. Of course, Naidu finds out Sundaram's designs, and issues him an ultimatum in true that if in 15 days he cannot get Sirisha to say I Love You, he'll be dead. Remaining story whether Sundaram will be successful in gaining Sirisha's love
