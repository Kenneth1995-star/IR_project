Mugiko-san to

Mugiko is a young woman who lives with her older brother in Tokyo. She works part-time in a manga and anime store, and wants to study to be a voice actress. The siblings' mother, Saiko, left their father when they were young, and Mugiko doesn't remember her. When their mother unexpectedly reappears and asks to live with them, her children reluctantly agree. But she dies soon after, without reconciling with her kids.
Mugiko travels alone to Saiko's small mountain hometown to inter her mother's ashes. There, she's a sensation because she looks so much like her mother, once an aspiring singer who had many male admirers. A mix-up leads to Mugiko's staying in the town for several days, where she gets to know several local residents whose own life stories partly parallel her own. Mugiko, who had referred to Saiko only as "that woman," begins to think of Saiko as her mother.[3]
