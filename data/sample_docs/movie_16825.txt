Persecuted

Reformed drug addict and America's leading evangelist John Luther opposes Senator Donald Harrison's 'Faith and Fairness Act', which would not allow Christians to state that they have the whole/only truth. To destroy Luther's credibility and ensure passage of the bill, Harrison has Luther framed for the rape and murder of a teenaged girl.
