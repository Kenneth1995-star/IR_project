Nattamai

Shanmugam (Sarath) is the village head fondly called as nattamai and is widely respected by everyone for his genuineness. He lives with his wife Lakshmi (Kushbu) and his brother Pasupathi (Sarath – dual role). Pasupathi is married to Meena (Meena). There is a long-standing enmity between nattamai and Ponnambalam. A flashback is shown where Ponnambalam’s father kills Shanmugam’s father (Vijayakumar) following which Ponnambalam’s family is expelled from the village. Ponnamabalam awaits for the right time to attack nattamai’s family. Ponnambalam’s mother (Manorama) is nattamai’s paternal aunt and is a kind hearted lady.
A new teacher (Rani) comes to the village and everyone suspects an illegitimate relationship between Pasupathi and the teacher. One day, the teacher gets killed along with a death note mentioning Pasupathi as the reason behind her death following which nattamai expels Pasupathi out of village as a punishment.
But the teacher was actually killed by Ponnamabalam with plans of trapping Pasupathi in the murder. Manorama overhears the truth but gets locked by Ponnamabalam at her home. Ponnambalam tries to kill nattamai but eventually gets killed by Manorama. Finally Manorama informs the truth to nattamai which shocks him. Nattamai dies at the spot due to the guilt of giving a wrong judgment to Pasupathi. Now Pasupathi becomes the next nattamai.
