 Cadillac Records

In 1947 in Chicago, a Jewish immigrant from Poland and bar owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) hires a blues combo, including guitarist Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) and harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short). Waters' and Walter's success leads to Chess opening the doors for black musicians and beginning a new record label in 1950 - Chess Records. This attracts stars like: Etta James (Beyonc√© Knowles), Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Chuck Berry (Mos Def). Inevitably, business and personal lines blur as the sometimes-turbulent lives of the musicians play out.
