Thaai Naadu

In the 60s...
A military Grand Officer (Sathiya Radj) is accused, inequitably, of intelligence with the enemy, during an operation, a code name: Day Break.
He is afterward, murdered, without he can put in time, the light on the truth. Murder made up in suicide by the criminals.
Four of his subordinates are suspected, his comrades-in-arms (the traitors of the history) who said to themselves his friend.
The name of the serviceman is banished for ever and his family delivered to the vindication of the people which sets on fire their place of residence, in reprisals.
His son (played also by Sathiyaraj), orphan (he believed it!), informed of his origins, at the moment, takes back the investigation of his father, thanks to a pad, to wash its honor and find the real culprits...
The film has an intuitive story line with Sathyaraj enacting dual role. The role as an army officer was appreciated by the critics.
