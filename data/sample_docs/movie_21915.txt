Cap Tourmente

Alex O'Neil has a deeply troubled mind. He also has a dysfunctional and incestuous family. He returns from his merchant seaman job to the rocky coasts of his home. His mother, Jeanne, doesn't seem to mind, and lets him stay at her bed and breakfast hotel. His sister, Alfa, seems to have the hots for him, just as she does for their old boyfriend Jean-Louis, who has just shown up. Jeanne seems to be attracted to him. All these people appear eager to get their hands on his body, but he's too wrapped up in what's going on inside his head to notice.
