Karuppusamy Kuththagaithaarar

Karuppusamy (Karan) is this happy-go-lucky guy next door who is a small-time contractor for cycle stands. When not at work, he kills time with his friends taking part in their mimicry troupe where he is famous for his Rajini look-alike acts. Life goes on for the protagonist until Raasathi (Meenakshi) stumbles upon in his life. An aspiring medical student, she relates Karuppusamy’s benevolence to her late mother’s. Soon after, they both become victims of the stupid cupid’s bait.
Although in love with the uncle, Karuppusamy insists that education should be her priority over romance. Besides, their love affair wreaks havoc in Raasathi’s upper caste family, which is known for cast prejudices. With a family to resist and her education to pay attention to, Raasathi finds it tough to get along. Finally, a seamless climax tells it all as to how the couple manages to pull it off against all the odds, predominantly Raasathi’s family.
