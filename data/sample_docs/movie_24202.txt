Draupadi

Duryodhana (Jagdish Sethi) plots to attain Hastinapur for himself and his hundred Kaurava brothers. The five Pandavas brothers are sent to exile during which time Arjuna (Prithviraj Kapoor wins Draupadi (Ermeline) at her swayamvara. According to his mother's unintentional suggestion, the five brothers share Draupadi as their wife. On their return from banishment, the Pandavas establish themselves at Indraprastha. The Rajasuya Yagna takes place and a game of dice follows. The Kauravas cunning uncle Shakuni (Hadi) helps them win the game, wherein the Pandavas first lose their Kingdom, and then as a last wager by the oldest brother Yudhishtra, even Draupadi. When Duryodhan, with the intention of shaming the Pandavas tries to remove Draupadi's sari, it is Lord Krishna who saves her from humiliation by performing the miracle of a never-ending sari.
