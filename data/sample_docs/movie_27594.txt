Vishnu Lokam

Tharakan, Bheemrajan, Kumari Kasthuri and Govindan Aashaan reached the village as part of the circus. Sankunni also reached there. Sankunni saw Savithrikutty. Prathapa Varma has an eye on her. Sankunni asked Savithrikutty not to surrender before Prathapa Varma. He asked Savithri to come along with him. But Savithri did not agree with this. Prathapa Varma's people beat Govindan Aashaan and others. So they decided to go to some other place. Sankunni saw Savithri Kutty and asked her to come along with him to some other place. Prathapa Varma's people beat Sankunni and kidnapped Savithrikutty. Sankunni reached Prathapa Varma's house and tried to kill Prathapa Varma. At last he took Savithri Kutty along with him.
