Ramya (Ramya Krishna) not only likes him, she also falls deeply in love with him. Padmanabham doesn't want to do anything with her, but when Ramya suggests that two salaries are better than one, he thinks it's a brilliant idea and marries her.

Sriram) pile on to him and then Ramya's good-for-nothing brother Ravi (Ravi Teja) also seeks shelter in their house.
