Arif, whose dream is to make film, went to a remote village from Dhaka city for attending a fair. He was accompanied by Saila, who was not previously known to him. The rural sights and culture overwhelmed both of them. But, they felt embarrassed when two of the influential families of that village engaged in quarrelling for a trivial incident. Many things were not consistent with the dream of Arif. He found similarities in the two families with the social reality of three hundred years old Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” and hundred fifty years old Tolstoy’s “ Little Girls Wiser than Men ”. Frustrated Arif, and he found one of his dreams’ sights as well. Both film and reality compiled together in his imagination. He became one of the characters of the film.
