Sailaab

Dr. Sushma Malhotra (Madhuri Dixit) treats her patient; a thief and killer, (Aditya Pancholi), who has lost his memory in some accident. She renames him Krishna. For the care she takes, Krishna falls in love with her and then they get married. But after they are married, Inspector Ranjit Kapoor (Suresh Oberoi) warns her that her husband was set to kill her before his accident and may again attempt to kill her, but she disregards this. In another accident while taking photographs of Sushma, Krishna falls down and hurts his head. This injury brings back his old memories. To Sushma's surprise, the old memories bring in something unexpected which results in Krishna trying to kill his wife Sushma. He says his name is Rajiv and claims Sushma killed his sister, but Inspector Ranjit arrives in time to stop him and tell him a criminal named Monty actually killed his sister. Together, Inspector Ranjit and Krishna find Monty and his gang and Monty confesses for killing Krishna's sister. Inspector Ranjit and Krishna then kill them. Finally Krishna regrets harming his wife and they both are united.
