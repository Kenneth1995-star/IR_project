Peddannayya

Ramakrishna Prasad (Balakrishna) is a powerful man who lives with the joint family. He has genuine family values and all the family members follow his words with respect. Seetha (Roja) is an adorable woman who loves Ramakrishna Prasad and waits patiently for him to marry her. Ramakrishna Prasad, on the other hand, worries about his family and thinks of their settlement. He has three brothers Sai Prasad (Achyut), Durga Prasad (Rajkumar), Bhavani Prasad (again Balakrishna). Bhavani Prasad studies in town at a medical college and he happens to marry a prostitute’s daughter (Indraja) without family’s permission. Rest of the film is about how Ramakrishna Prasad’s family fights over their troubles and questions the injustice happening in the village.
