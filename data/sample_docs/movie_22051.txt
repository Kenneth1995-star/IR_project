Yellowknife

Max (Sébastien Huberdeau) and Linda (Hélène Florent) travel from New Brunswick to the Northwest Territories. Along the way, they hook up with two other couples: two strippers and a night-club singer and her manager. The relationships along the way take them as far as their desperate and receding passions allow.
