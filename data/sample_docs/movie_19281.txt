The Long Arm

When police respond to a burglar alarm they find nothing amiss after meeting the nightwatchman who allowed them to search the premises. However, the next day the safe, having been opened with a key, is found empty. Supt Tom Halliday (Jack Hawkins) and his new Detective Sergeant, Ward (John Stratton), begin searching for the fraudulent nightwatchman.
Halliday deduces that the false nightwatchman has committed 14 safe-breaking jobs across the country, all against the same type of safe, and all with keys. Visiting the safe maker, Halliday gets the names of all current and former staff, but they are all cleared. When another safe is opened, a bystander is run over by the thief in their getaway car. The victim manages to pass limited information to the police before dying. The hit-and-run vehicle is found in a scrap yard. The car had been stolen from a Mrs Elliot and inside they find a newspaper that leads them to a garage in north Wales and a certain Mr Gilson, a deceased former employee of the safe maker.
Halliday finds there are 28 further safes in London. He also finds out that Gilson is being tipped off which safes have a lot of cash in them by an insurance agent. The police arrange with the owner of a safe in the Festival Hall to let the insurance agent know about gala nights that generate a lot of cash. They then tailed the insurance agent to a meeting with the same, Mrs Elliot. However, she is identified as Mrs Gilson, the wife of the apparently dead safe key maker.
Halliday and Ward deduce that Gilson faked his own death after spending years making duplicate keys (the third key) for all the safes his company produced. Gilson hits Festival Hall but the detectives are waiting. After a short scuffle, Mrs Gilson arrives in a sports car. Halliday jumps on the bonnet and breaks the windscreen as Ward chases down Gilson on foot. Both are arrested and case is solved.
