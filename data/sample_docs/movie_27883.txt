Ponnu (Kavya Madhavan) is a typical self-made village girl. She has survived odds after her father’s murder when she was just a child. A vivacious girl with a mind of her own, she does everything under the sun—from rearing goats, milking cows to gathering firewood and cow dung in order to repay her father’s debts. So he fills the surroundings with stereotypes: There is a villainous Tamil moneylender Pandi (Kalabhavan Mani), a deceptive father figure (Murali) and film-crazy lover-boy Benny (Sunil Kumar alias Narain). Pandi has an eye on Ponnu. He employs the age-old tactic of moneylenders and a debt trap to get her. He is assisted in this by Vijayaraghavan (Ponnu’s father’s buddy). Benny comes to her rescue and kills Pandi’s brother after a languorous fist fight just before the interval. After that, everything goes haywire. The focus shift to the jail, where lover-boy is undergoing rigorous imprisonment for six years on charges of murder. He suffered several atrocities at the hands of jail warden. His cellmates are hardcore criminals and he has to fight injustices there.
