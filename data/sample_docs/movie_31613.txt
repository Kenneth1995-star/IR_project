Varalakshmi) are in a playful mood and ignore Bhrigu. Angered by this, Bhrigu kicks Vishnu on his chest. To pacify the sage, Vishnu held his legs and pressed the extra eye in his foot the symbol of his egotism where sage realized his folly and apologized to Vishnu. But Lakshmi gets upsets. In that anger, she leaves to earth, Vishnu goes in search of her and settles in an anthill without food & water. Taking pity on Vishnu, Brahma & Shiva assumed the forms of a cow and its calf to serve him. Lakshmi in the form of a cowherdess sold them to the king. Discovering Vishnu on the ant-hill, the cow provided its milk, and thus fed him. Meanwhile, at the palace, the cow was not yielding any milk, for which the queen chastised the royal cow herder Sarabha (Ramana Reddy) severely. To find out the cause Sarabha follows the cow secretly and discovered the cow emptying her udder over the ant-hill. Angered Sarabha flung his axe to harm the cow. However, Vishnu rose from the ant-hill to receive the blow then he curses Sarabha to roam as a ghost until he forms as a diety at this place.
