Chakravarthy

Chakravarthy (Karthik), a new CID officer, lives in Bhanu's rental house. Bhanu (Bhanupriya) hates the police department so Chakravarthy lies about his job. His superior (Major Sundarrajan) reveals that Bhanu killed her half-brother Boopathy (Nizhalgal Ravi). Chakravarthy begins to investigate in this odd affair.
