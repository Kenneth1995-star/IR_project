Gokulamlo Seeta

Pawan Kalyan (Pawan Kalyan) is a careless and spoiled brat of a rich man Muddu Krishnayya (Kota Srinivasa Rao). Kalyan has every weakness that a rich and careless youth can have, and Baburao (Sudhakar) helps him in all his activities. Once, Kalyan and his friend/employee Bhaskar (Harish) attend a function, where Kalyan spots Sirisha (Raasi) singing on stage, and is impressed by her beauty and tries to woo her but doesn't succeed. At the same time Bhaskar too is impressed by her and expresses his love to her, but is rejected by Sirisha. A disheartened Bhaskar tries to commit suicide but is saved. Sirisha accepts his love and leaves to see her mother to seek her blessings for marriage. But her mother plans something else for her. She tries to marry her off with her cousin Sriram (Achyuth). Sirisha writes a letter to Bhaksar to take her away and save her from this marriage. Kalyan is shocked, when he knows that Bhaskar is trying to marry the same Sirisha, who rejected his offer, but agrees to bring her. Kalyan manages to bring Sirisha to Bhaskar’s house, but Bhaskar’s parents oppose this marriage by insulting Sirisha. Kalyan loses his temper and hits Bhaskar’s father adding fuel to fire. A disheartened Sirisha leaves their house, but is saved by Kalyan and taken to his house. His father Muddu Krishnayya and servant, Malli (Mallikarjuna Rao) suspect their relationship, and this suspicion spreads in Kalyan’s friends circle. Sirisha accuses Kalyan of all this rumors and this brings about a change in Kalyan’s attitude towards woman and his life. He decides to marry Sirisha and asks his father to help him in this regard. But his father insults her and she leaves their house and returns to her mother. Kalyan, after learning his father’s mistake, reaches Sirisha’s house, but is discouraged by her cousin and mother. He goes on a hunger strike till she accepts his love. In the end Muddu Krishnayya apologises for his mistake and unites the lovers.
