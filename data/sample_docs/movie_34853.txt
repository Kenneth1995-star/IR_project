Honey

In the remote and undeveloped eastern Black Sea region, a six-year-old boy (Yusuf) wanders through the woods searching for his lost father, trying to make sense of his life.[5] His father is a beekeeper whose bees have disappeared unexpectedly, threatening his livelihood.[5] A bizarre accident kills the father.[8] There is little dialogue or music in the film.[5] The three main characters (Yusuf and his parents) are all fairly taciturn, and the soundtrack is filled out with the sounds of the forest and the creatures that live there.[9] The environment is a recurring theme.[10]
