Invasion Quartet

Two wounded officers, one British and one French are deemed unfit and surplus to requirements. They leave their hospital and together with an explosives expert suffering from mental illness and a Colonel thought too old to serve in the Army make their way to France to destroy a long range German artillery piece.
The plot has similarities to the exploits of Commando Sgt Peter King and Pte Leslie Cuthbertson.
