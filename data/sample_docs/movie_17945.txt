 Hounds of Love

Vicki Maloney, an intelligent and charismatic teenager inwardly struggling with her parents’ recent separation, spends the weekend at her mother’s house in outer suburbia. After a heated argument between them, Vicki defiantly sneaks out to attend a party and is lured into the car of a seemingly trustworthy couple, John and Evelyn White. Now at John and Evelyn’s house, Vicki soon finds herself held captive where she is forced into a dark world of violence and domination. With no way to escape and her murder imminent, Vicki realizes she must find a way to drive a wedge between them if she’s to survive her ordeal, and tries exploiting Evelyn’s desire to see her absent children. Unfortunately, John’s emotional hold over Evelyn is far beyond Vicki’s comprehension and her efforts to turn them against each other only fuels Evelyn’s will to see her die. Broken and tormented, Vicki accepts her fate may soon lie at the bottom of a shallow bush grave. Meanwhile Vicki’s desperate mother Maggie will stop at nothing to find her missing child. When Maggie’s search leads her to John and Evelyn’s street, Vicki finds the strength for one last attempt at survival by forcing Evelyn to realize if she ever wants to see her children again, she must break free from John’s evil spell.
