Abie's Irish Rose

A Jewish boy, Abie Levy (Rogers), falls in love with and secretly marries Rosemary Murphy (Carroll), an Irish Catholic girl, but lies to his family, saying that she's Jewish. The fathers of both bride and groom are at first religiously bigoted toward the other but with the birth of twin grandchildren, their antagonism fades.
