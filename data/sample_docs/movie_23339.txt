The Bare-Footed Kid

After the death of his father, the poor and illiterate Kwan Fung-yiu (Aaron Kwok) goes out to the provincial capital to seek refuge from Tuen Ching-wan (Ti Lung), a friend of his deceased father, and works in a dye factory, the "Four Seasons Weaver". The political situation in the capital is tense. With his superior identity as a Manchurian, Hak Wo-po (Kenneth Tsang), owner of the "Tin Lung Spinner", dominates the city and set up a gambling den where he sends his workers to fight with workers of "Four Seasons Weave". The newly appointed magistrate Yuen Tin-yau (Cheung Siu-fai) and his instructor Mr. Wah (Paul Chun) want to eradicate Hak, but they do not have enough evidence to bring him to justice. Later, Tin-yau meets Pak Siu-kwan (Maggie Cheung), the owner of "Four Seasons Weaver" and Wah's daughter Lin (Jacklyn Wu). Then it was revealed that Tuen was a fugitive who changed his name and hid in the dye factory to avoid arrest and developed affection towards Pak. Fung-yiu and Lin also develops a mutual bond after an incident.
"Tin Lung Spinners" had always been inferior to "Four Seasons Weaver". Feeling vengeful, Hak sets "Four Seasons Weave" on fire to vent his anger. Fung-yiu, who is witless, dazed and confused, gets up to the fighting arena, and was lured by Hak where he kills his friend's father. Fung-yiu had fallen further and further into a quagmire of confusion. He also reveals Tuen's past identity as a killer and Tuen is wanted by officials. Fortunately, Yuen Tin-yau's discerning eyes can tell greatness from Fung-yiu, and they work together to defeat the "Dragon Place". However, Tuen was unfortunately ambushed by Hak where he swallowed poison and shot to death by millions of arrows. Fung-yiu hurried off to save Tuen, but it was too late by then.
