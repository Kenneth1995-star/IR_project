Rabba Main Kya Karoon

Rabba Main Kya Karoon [3] revolves around two brothers Shrawan (Arshad Warsi) and his younger brother Sahil (Akash Chopra) who is getting married lavishly in a typical Indian style in Delhi.
Sahil is eager to marry his childhood sweetheart Sneha (Tahira Kochhar), until older brother Shrawan joins the celebration, encouraging Sahil to do what men do by cheating on his wife. Shrawan is only teaching Sahil what he learnt from their uncles (Paresh Rawal, Tinnu Anand and Shakti Kapoor), whose mantra for a successful married life is "In order to live a happy married life, one must cheat on his wife!"
