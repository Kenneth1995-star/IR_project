Munna

Munna (Prabhas) is a college student. His aim is to finish off mafia don Kakha (Prakash Raj) who keeps the entire city under his grip. Munna has a personal vengeance to take on Kakha. An honest politician Srinivasa Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) relentlessly works to expose Kakha but is killed. Meanwhile, Munna's classmate Nidhi (Ileana D'Cruz) falls in love with him. The twist in the tale is that Kakha is none other than his estranged father who tries to sell off his mother and was responsible for the death of his mother and his young sister. Another don in the city named Aatma (Rahul Dev), who is the opposition of Kakha asks Munna to join him but Munna refuses his proposal. Munna starts to beat Kakha and the mind game begins. Kakha's second wife, son and daughter leave him and join Munna. After some incidents including the death of his best friend, Munna finds out that Aatma was working for Kakha all along. Aatma's henchmen didn't know that Aatma still worked for Kakha. The two of them plan on killing him in a factory when all of a sudden Aatma turns against Kakha and Munna. Kakha kills Aatma for the betrayal. Having lost everything Kakha worked for in his life, he commits suicide. Thereby, Munna succeeds in taking revenge against Kakha.
