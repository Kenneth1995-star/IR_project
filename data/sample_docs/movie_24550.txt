Asha (Mala Sinha) is in court facing a murder trial. Puran (Bharat Bhushan), a lawyer and journalist, takes the case. The story then goes into flashback, showing Asha working in the rationing office just after the war. She comes from a poor family and is the sole earning member. She also has six younger sisters to take care of. Puran comes from a rich family; his father is Seth Mulchand, a businessman. However, Puran decides to work for a newspaper, as a reporter. Asha likes Puran's articles exposing corruption and black-marketing, and his articles on working women. She gets interested in meeting the writer. The two meet in her office at her place of work. While leaving, Puran manages to drop his papers, and they get jumbled up with the papers on Asha's desk. Her paycheck, which was lying on the desk, is picked up by Puran by mistake along with his own papers. She meets Puran again to get her check back.
Following several meetings, Asha and Puran fall in love, which is disapproved of by Puran's father. Seth Mulchand tries bribing Asha to stay away from Puran, but she refuses. Seth has also attempted to get Puran to give up his journalism, but Puran is stubbornly defiant. An annoyed Seth then buys the newspaper where Puran works, but this results in Puran setting up his own newspaper. Seth then has Asha's youngest sister kidnapped and a ransom is demanded. Since Asha does not have the money for the ransom, she goes to Seth Mulchand. In lieu of the money she borrows, she signs a note stating that she's taking the money to leave Puran. This leads to misunderstandings between her and Puran. One of Asha's sisters, Uma (Madhavi), visits a club where she is molested by the owner. She ends up killing the club owner and Asha takes the blame. Puran manages to prove Asha's innocence in court and also clears up the rift created between them by his father.
