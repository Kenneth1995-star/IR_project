Chilipi Krishnudu

Dr. Krishna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) a medic, is the spoilt son of a rich businessman (Satyanarayana), for whom the life is all about playing pranks and troubling people around. Finally, he is taught a lesson in humility by a fellow student, Vani (Vanisri) and a dramatic change in outlook and falls in love with her. But his joy is short-lived as Raja (Prabhakar Reddy) and his gang try to rape Vani for which she commits suicide. On her death-bed, Krishna promises Vani that he will take care of her family settled in a remote village. Krishna reaches the village where he is astounding to see Vani's twin sister Rani (again Vanisri) who lives in the village with her mother Meenakshamma (Shantha Kumari). Then he starts practicing medicine in their small village as this was what Vani wanted to do. With time, both are drawn towards each other until one day Raja is in front of him and he comes to know that Raja is his elder brother who was separated when they were young.
