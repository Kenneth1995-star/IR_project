Mr. Roper, an insurance investigator, travels to Brighton to assess the apparent death of a businessman, after his burning car was seen crashing over a cliff into the sea. The insurance company are suspicious, as the man had only recently taken out life insurance for a large sum. When the car is recovered and no body is found, Roper and the police have to find out whether they are dealing with an accident, an insurance fraud or a murder.
