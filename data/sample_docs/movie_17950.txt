 Sweet Country

Sam is a middle-aged Aboriginal farmer in the outback of Australia's Northern Territory. He is sent by a preacher to help a bitter war veteran named Harry to help renovate the latter's cattle yards. Sam's relationship with Harry quickly deteriorates, resulting in a fight ending with Sam killing Harry in self-defence. For the murder of a white man, Sam is now on the run from the law with his wife across the deadly outback. A manhunt for the farmer is on, led by Sergeant Fletcher, but questions of justice start to surface among the community as the true details of the murder come to light.
