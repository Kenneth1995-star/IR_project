Empire of Lust

Kim Min-jae (Shin Ha-kyun), is a brilliant general who's distinguished himself by protecting the borders of the recently established Joseon dynasty. He keeps a close eye on Yi Bang-won (Jang Hyuk), the fifth son of King Taejo (Son Byong-ho), whom he believes has ambitions of seizing the throne, Jin (Kang Ha-neul), is Kim Min-Jae's son and the King's son-in-law. Due to his position as the King's son-in-law, he is unable to take part in politics and only seeks out pleasure. Yi Bang-won was instrumental in helping his father overthrow the Goryeo dynasty and founding Joseon, but was passed over when Taejo chose his successor. Meanwhile, Kim Min-jae falls in love for the first time with a gisaeng named Ka-hee (Kang Han-na), whom he takes as his concubine, not realizing that she aims to carry out a vendetta against him.
