Love Among Thieves

Baroness and concert pianist, Caroline DuLac, steals three jewel-encrusted Fabergé eggs from a San Francisco museum. The eggs are demanded as ransom for her kidnapped fiancé in Latin America. She boards a plane for the Latin American city of Ladera, as per instructions, and is met by a drifter named Mike Chambers.
Caroline first believes that Mike is one of the kidnappers, until a mysterious man in a trench coat tries to kill her and Mike comes to the rescue. They are both captured by a band of Mexican bandits, who also may or may not be part of the scheme. Meanwhile, the couple are pursued by Spicer, a hired thug assigned to retrieve the loot.
