Killing Time

After the mobster who murdered his partner is acquitted, semi-corrupt detective Robert Bryant (Craig Fairbrass) hires a beautiful Italian female assassin, Maria (Kendra Torgan), to kill him. When he discovers that he cannot afford Maria's services, Bryant is forced to hire another assassin, Madison, to kill her. Maria survives the doublecross and sets out to collect what's owed to her, one way or another.
Most of the movie takes place in a hotel room where the thugs come one by one to kill off the hitwoman.
The hitwoman, in between taking a bath, listening to instructional tapes and listening to music, dispatches all the thugs one by one, hence the opening title.
While the thugs sit around and wait to hear back from whichever one they've sent off to do the hitwoman in, the police officer Bryant and his partner investigate an antique store killing, which rapidly becomes a debate about character when Bryant's partner quickly figures out that Bryant is involved. In the end, more violence and a clever twist.
