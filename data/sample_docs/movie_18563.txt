Room for Two

The story takes place in Venice, where a womanising Englishman Vic Oliver takes a strong interest in a married tourist who is played by Frances Day. Oliver disguises himself in drag and gets himself hired as the Days' maid. When Day's philandering husband, played by Basil Radford, shows up, the fun starts.
