That's My Boy

Expecting to become a doctor, Thomas Jefferson Scott enrolls at Thorpe University. A football coach there, "Daisy" Adams, finds out that while small, Tommy is quick and elusive and a natural at the sport. Tommy isn't interested in football, but jumps at the coach's offer of free tuition.
For the next two seasons, Tommy is a star player, nicknamed "Snakehips," and a hero on campus. But he resents that while he's worth a fortune to the college, he has little money and has jeopardized his future in medicine and with fiancee Dorothy by concentrating on football instead. Tommy demands $50,000. A university alumnus, Sedgwick, who is a stockbroker, sets up a holding company in which investors can put their money into Tommy's potential earnings.
Everything goes wrong. Sedgwick's investments are poor, he loses all of the money and commits suicide. Dorothy's father, who dislikes Tommy, tempts him with $50,000 if he will break off their engagement. Tommy thinks it over, then asks for $100,000. The crowd boos Tommy on the football field until the newspapers report that Tommy took the 100 grand and replenished the fund, ensuring everyone's investments. To the fans' cheers, Tommy wins the game for Thorpe, the ends up marrying Dorothy.
