Babu (Anand Babu), son of a rich businessman, is also admitted in the same ward as them. They become friends in a short time of period. They finally come to know that they will live only for few more monthsÂ : the four friends have blood cancer. The friends decide to leave the hospital and to travel.
They arrive in a small village where Sivalingam (K. S. Ravikumar) spreads terror among the villagers. The friends are accommodated by an old blind women (Sukumari) and her daughter Nirmala (Nirmala Shyam).
