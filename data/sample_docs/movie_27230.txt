Sridhar, Sihi Kahi Chandru, Ramesh Bhat and Tennis Krishna are good friends and stay together as tenants at Mukhyamantri Chandru's residence. After being thrown out of the house they start searching new house for rent but no one are ready to give their house for bachelors.
Finally, they land up in a place where the landlady insists on having a family as her tenants. The four bachelors dress up to be a man (Ramesh Bhat), his retarded brother (Tennis Krishna), his father (Sihi Kahi Chandru) and his wife (Shridhar). Later, Sridhar falls in love with the landlady's daughter and all hell breaks loose.
