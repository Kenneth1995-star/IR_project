Repulsion

Carol Ledoux (Catherine Deneuve), a Belgian manicurist, lives in Battersea, London, with her older sister Helen (Yvonne Furneaux). Carol practically sleepwalks through her days, and interacts awkwardly with men. A would-be suitor, Colin (John Fraser), is flummoxed by her behaviour and she rebuffs his advances, disgusted by them.
She hides her head in her pillow against her sister's cries of sexual pleasure with her lover, Michael (Ian Hendry). When Helen leaves on a holiday in Italy with Michael, Carol appears even more distracted at work, gets sent home after cutting a customer during a manicure. She stays in the apartment, leaving a raw, skinned rabbit out to rot, and begins to hallucinate, first seeing the walls cracking, a man breaking in and molesting her, later hands reaching out to grab and attack her. Colin breaks into her apartment when she refuses to acknowledge his adoration and he apologizes for his transgression. When he says he wants to "be with [her] all the time," she bludgeons him to death with a candlestick, dumps the body into the overflowing bathtub, and nails the broken door shut.
Later, the landlord (Patrick Wymark) also breaks in, looking for the late rent payment. Carol pays him and sits on the sofa, staring into space. He remarks on the decaying state of the apartment, and attempts to ingratiate himself by bringing her a glass of water as he leers at her in her nightgown. When he first propositions, then sexually assaults her, she gets away. When he comes at her again and she slashes him to death with a straight razor.
When Helen and Michael return, they discover the corpses and Michael goes for help. Helen finds Carol hiding under the bed in a catatonic state. Neighbors arrive â€“ curious, concerned and shocked. Michael returns and carries wide-eyed Carol out. A family photograph on the floor shows Carol as a girl with a similar wide-eyed expression.
