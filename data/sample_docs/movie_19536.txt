Sword of Sherwood Forest

The Sheriff of Nottingham (Peter Cushing) plans to confiscate the estate of the Lord of Bawtry, a nobleman who has died on Crusade. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter (Jack Gwillim), speaks against this plan and the Sheriff plots to eliminate him. Robin Hood is asked to undertake the assassination of the Archbishop for the plotters, led by the Earl of Newark (Richard Pasco) and Lord Melton (Oliver Reed), but on realising who the intended target is, resolves to help the Archbishop instead.
Maid Marian (Sarah Branch) also wants to meet the Archbishop so she can grant freedom to the family of a man murdered by the Sheriff's men, and she is also keen to meet Robin again who she met when she thought he was a common outlaw, but now realises he is on the side of good.
