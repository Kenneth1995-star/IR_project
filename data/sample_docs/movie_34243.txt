Ghost

Only yesterday Yuri Gordeev was an ambitious aircraft designer, a ladies' man, and on the verge of his triumph. His plane YG-1 was supposed to be a real breakthrough in domestic aviation. But today, no one sees or hears about him, and a rival business smoothly causes Yuri's company to close. That is because Yuri drove while inebriated, got into a car accident, died and became a ghost.
Seventh grader Ivan Kuznetsov, or Vanya for short, was always in an empty place. A victim of an overprotective mother, the object of ridicule from classmates, he is afraid to even talk to a girl with whom he has been in love for a long time. Yuri has one week to complete his life's work and to raise his new aircraft into the air, while Vanya is the only one who can see and help him.
