Saravanan Irukka Bayamaen

Saravanan (Udayanidhi) is a jobless youth who roams around in a two-wheeler with his bunch of friends. Kalyanam (Soori), his uncle, aspires for a political career but due to the error committed by a drunk photographer, Saravanan ends up as the local head of a national party, and this upsets his uncle.Kalyanam on the other hand is left with no option but to leave the country to take up a petty job in Dubai. His other uncleâ€™s daughter Thaenmozhi (Regina Cassandra) returns to town after many years, and quite naturally, Saravanan is besotted by her and falls head over heels in love with her. In the meantime, Kalyanam also returns and awaits an opportunity to teach a lessor or two to Saravanan. Whether Saravanan succeeds in his love and whether Kalyanam manages to put Saravanan in his place, is narrated in the most boring fashion.
