Muthu Kaalai

The film begins with Poochi (Vadivelu) announcing bad news to Muthu Kaalai (Karthik). Muthu Kaalai first refuses to see Poonjolai in her death-bed but he finally accepts.
In the past, Poonjolai (Soundarya) was from a rich family in her village while Muthu Kaalai was a poor herdsman who worked for Raakayi (Manorama). Since their first meeting, Poonjolai hated him and put Muthu Kaalai in a lot of troubles. Muthu Kaalai wanted to marry Poonjolai but Poonjolai's uncles Sakthivel (Napoleon), Sangaiah (Vijayakumar) and Rathnavel (Chandrasekhar) were determined to wipe out his wish.
