Aamar Bhuban

After Sakhina and Nur's divorce, Sakhina has remarried Kaushik; a man who loves her but has difficulty providing for them and their three children. Nur went on to the Middle East and came back a rich man. He has remarried. Nur and Kaushik are cousins and Nur tries to help Kaushik (and Sakhina) by giving him work and lending him money. But when he returns Sakhina's prized nose-ring, which he had given her secretly during their marriage and not taken back during the divorce, and which Kaushik later pawned for some money, Sakhina is insulted and hurt.
