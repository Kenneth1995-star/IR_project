During the Second Sino-Japanese War era in China, patriot Mr. Gao (Chiang Ming) is dissatisfied with the traitorous acts of the Reorganized National Government of China and together with thief Black Hat (Jimmy Wang Yu), he steals a traitorous contract set up by the government for the Japanese. Gao plans to bring the contract from Shanghai to Hong Kong and break it to the public, in hopes of exposing the traitorous acts of the Reorganized Government. Gao becomes the assassination target of the Reorganized Government's interior minister Hung Xu-wu (Seung Fung).
In order to ensure a smooth arrival of Mr. Gao and the contract to Hong Kong, Shanghai Tycoon Shen Gang-fu (Chen Kuan-tai) decides to send his underlings, the Shanghai 13, to protect Gao while on his way to the dock. Unexpectedly, there are moles among the 13 men who betray Gao and Shen. With obstacles ahead and pursuers behind, under the condition of obstruction by the traitors, can Mr. Gao successfully arrive to the dock? Are the Shanghai 13 loyal or evil? On the road to the dock, there are murderous traps everywhere and bloody battles appear one after another.
