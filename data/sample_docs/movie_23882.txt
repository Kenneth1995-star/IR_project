Enteng Kabisote 10 and the Abangers

Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) has been living the comfortable life even without his other companions: Aiza (Aiza Seguerra), who is living in a faraway town; his wife Faye (Pauleen Luna) still in Encantasia; and Amy (Ruby Rodriguez) and her husband gone. But he was torn between his son Benok (Oyo Boy Sotto) and his pampered grandson (Alonzo Muhlach). He argues with Benok over who is right to raise his own son and goes to Bohol to tour it, meeting a member of "Abangers" who has the power of iron. He approaches a hotel attendant Georgia (Ryza Cenon) and Nicomaine (Maine Mendoza) and thinks the tour guide Richard (Alden Richards) is a handsome man, but disappointed, he continues the tour.
Three old triplets (Jose Manalo), (Wally Bayola) and (Paolo Ballesteros) run a factory until the workers go into a strike and are exiled as punishment.
Kwak Kwak (Epy Quizon) is one of those so-called OEWs that is banished by the leaders, hatches a plan to eliminate the Abangers and eventually Enteng so that his vengeance will be complete. He has sidekicks with duckfaces and other of his minions who are also Encantados who were exiles.
Enteng was given a powered suit by the Abangers when they meet, but Kwak Kwak and his minions attacks and captures him and the group. They are put in stasis when Enteng pleads with the scientist to renege. The group later faces and defeats Kwak Kwak and his minions.
The closing scenes depict what happened to the Abangers: one (Jerald Napoles) has owned a gym, another (Sinon Lloresca) became a comedy bar owner; another (Cacai Bautista) built a fortune teller shop in Makati that caters to the elite; the three Lolas became Eat Bulaga!'s characters (a nod from Kalyeserye's Explorer sisters); and the tour guide built his own shop. Enteng reunites with his family while talking to somebody on his phone.
