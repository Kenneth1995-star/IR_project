Nallavan Vazhvan

Accused inequitably of a murder, the nice Muthu (MGR), judged and sentenced to death, succeeds however, to flee. He will have to himself confuse the culprit, Nalasivam (M. R. Radha), the local personality, of the most well-to-do, above suspicion, in priori. During its escape, disguised as shaman, Muthu leads investigation its survey and can matter on the indestructible support of some women. First of all, his, young and beautiful Chandra (Rajasulochana) (that he saved formerly, captivates, already hands of Nalasivam), of its mother (Lakshmi Prabha) and the one that he considers as its young sister Chenbagame (E. V. Saroja). But the husband of the latter, the inspector of police, in charge of this case, tough Madhavan (M.N.Nambhiyar), friend, nevertheless, Muthu, convinced as for him, his guilt, does not stop pursuing him. Whereas the hired men thrown by Nalasivam cross the region in search of the fugitive to kill him. In front of such threats, will Muthu manage to put, in time, the hand on the unique witness (P.S.Seethalaksmi) which could exonerate him?
