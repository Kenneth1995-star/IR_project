Shankardada Zindabad

Shankar Dada (Chiranjeevi) is a local goon and ATM (Any Time Murder) (Srikanth) is like his brother. Shankar is in love with Jahnavi (Karishma Kotak) who works at a radio station. She also owns the second innings house. The only problem is that she does not know that Shankar is a goon and believes that he is a professor. When Rajalingam (Sayaji Shinde) takes the second innings house, Jahnavi, Shankar and the residents of the second innings decide to camp in front of his house. What happens when Jahnavi finds out who Shankar really is?
