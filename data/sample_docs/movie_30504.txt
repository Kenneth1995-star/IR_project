Bala

Bala (Shaam) is the favourite hitman of gangster Pasupathi (Rajan P. Dev). When Bala is not zooming around in jeeps with a wild-looking gang, parading down lanes with the same gang faithfully following a step behind him, or knocking down one person or another, he's successfully wooing Aarthi (Meera Jasmine), the girl he has fallen for at first sight. Aarthi is the daughter of Jeyamani (Raghuvaran), a rival gangster. Ailing don Paranthaman (Thilakan), the mentor of the two rivals, seeing his protégés at each other's throats, brings a compromise by suggesting that Aarthi will be married to Pasupathi's wayward son. Bala naturally becomes a pariah in both camps, till it's all's well that ends well.
