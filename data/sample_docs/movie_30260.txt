Udhavikku Varalaamaa

Muthurasu (Karthik) has come to the city to earn money to finance his mother's (Vadivukkarasi) operation and asks for ideas from his friend Annamalai (Janagaraj). To rent a place owned by a Brahmin couple (Manivannan and Kovai Sarala), Muthurasu transforms himself into a Brahmin Pichumani and also falls in love with Mythili (Devayani), the couple's daughter. Getting a job at a company owned by a devout Muslim (Jaiganesh) makes him put on the garb of Hussein, a Muslim. Things get more complicated when an unsafe situation makes him take on the role of Pastor James, a Christian and Stella (Sangeetha), his secretary in the office where he works as Hussein, falls in love with him.
