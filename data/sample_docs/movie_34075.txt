Sisters, Yekaterina Gorina, Roman Ageyevas Albert "Alik" Murtazaev

Sveta (Oksana Akinshina) and Dina (Katya Gorina) are two half-sisters. Dina is spoiled and lives with her mother Natalia (Tatiana Kolganova) and father Alik (Roman Ageyev), who is a mid-ranking gangster, while Sveta lives with her grandma (Tatyana Tkach) in a more humble existence and wishes to be a sniper in the Russian Army.
Upon Alik's release from prison after doing some time for a robbery, some of his old associates demand him to pay them back some money he allegedly owes. When he refuses, they attempt to kidnap the two girls to try to intimidate him to give them the money. However they manage to escape, and go on the run from the mob through semi-rural Russia while their father attempts to sort affairs with the other gangsters.
