Beyond a Reasonable Doubt

Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer), a newspaper publisher, wants to prove a point about the inadequacy of circumstantial evidence. He talks his daughter's fiancee, Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews), into participating in a hoax, in an attempt to expose the ineptitude of the city's hard-line district attorney. The plan is for Tom to plant clues which will lead to his arrest for the murder of a female nightclub dancer, Patty Gray. Once Tom is found guilty, Spencer is to reveal the setup and humiliate the District Attorney.
Tom agrees to the plan, not knowing that unforeseen events will put a snag in the scheme. Spencer dies in a car accident before he can testify, and photographic evidence intended to clear Tom at his trial is burned to an unrecognizable state. Tom is found guilty and placed on death row in prison. A written testimony by the dead man is found in time to prove the two men's intentions, and Tom is to be pardoned.
However, a slip about the late woman's real name to his fiancee Susan (Joan Fontaine), leads him to confess. Patty Gray, the murder victim, is actually Emma Blucher, Tom Garrett's estranged wife, who had reneged on her promise to divorce him in Mexico. As this was preventing Garrett from marrying Susan he murdered Emma. Garrett's pardon is cancelled in time to prevent the double jeopardy rule coming into effect, and the film closes with him being led back to his cell. We are given to assume that his execution goes ahead as scheduled.
