Sadgati

The film is a vicious indictment of the Indian caste system. When a poor and low caste village shoemender, Dukhi (Om Puri), goes to the village Brahmin (Hindu priest) (Mohan Agashe) to get the date of his daughter's marriage fixed, the Brahmin in turn asks for labour without pay in exchange. The ensuing events turn the tables against the priest, who in the end has to forego the lofty traditions, including that of untouchability, he held so dearly all his life as village priest.[1]
