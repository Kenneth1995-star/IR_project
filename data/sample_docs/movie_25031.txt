She dies at childbirth, but not before extracting from the DSP his promise to take care of her son. Subsequently, DSP Singh raises the boy alongside his own. Though DSP Singh's natural son Kishen (Vinod Khanna) has a wicked streak, w Mangal's son, Amit (Amitabh Bachchan), is endowed with an honest nature.
Released after 14 years in jail, Mangal finds out that his son is with his old enemy. He mistakes Kishen to be his son and instigates him to fight against Shamsher's family. They join the underworld gang and spread havoc. Amit becomes an honest police officer and is assigned the task of nabbing the gang. After a misunderstanding, Kishen comes to believe he is actually Mangal's son and falls under the bandit's influence, though he continues to live in the inspector's home.[2]
The remainder of the film deals with how Kishen and Amit find out the truth about their origins and how they react to the situation.
