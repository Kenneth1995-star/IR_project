Ziddi

On the lookout for employment, Ashok (Joy Mukherjee) sees the photographs of beautiful Asha (Asha Parekh), and decides to accept employment as the estate's Manager. His expectations are short-lived as Asha turns out to be a rich, spoiled, conceited bratty young lady. To complicate matters further, Seema (Nazima), Asha's sister is attracted to Ashok. Ashok and Asha do like and eventually end up in love with each other, but Ashok's dad (Ulhas) does not approve to their marriage as he knows of Asha's parentage, a father who is an escaped convict, in jail for murder, and a mother whose profession was: prostitution. Ashok himself sees Asha in her true colors when she sings and dances at a party, overly intoxicated.
