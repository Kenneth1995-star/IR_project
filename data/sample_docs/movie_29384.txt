Pesum Dheivam

The life of a human being is examined in this film. From the beginning of life, humans have needs and wants. A baby wants toys, a child wants playmates, a teen wants a partner, an adult wants a spouse... the wants never ends. The human here is Padmini who after getting married to Sivaji Ganesan, yearns for a child. Barren for a long time, they make special arrangements with their maid to adopt her unborn child. But their happiness is short-lived when the new born baby dies. Their sadness is overtaken soon, when Padmini becomes pregnant. The child is born and is healthy. Does Padmini's wants end there? No, the child has a special problem.... and the wants continue.
