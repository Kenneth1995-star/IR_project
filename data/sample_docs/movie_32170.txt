Satyam

Satyam (Sumanth) is an aspiring lyric writer who has a knack for inadvertently getting misunderstood by the two people he cares for the mostâ€”his father (Malladi Raghava) and his love interest Ankita (Genelia D'Souza). Because he and his father don't get along, Satyam leaves home and starts living with his friends. A sensitive man and a talented writer, Satyam ghost-writes for a popular film lyricist. He wants to prove himself as a lyricist before expressing his love for Ankita. In the meantime, a flamboyant classmate of Ankita proposes to her. The movie then witnesses a turn of events which involves Ankita's father (Kota Srinivas Rao,) who happens to be a good friend of Satyam. How Satyam overcomes his obstacles and finally succeeds in courting Ankita forms the rest of the story.
