The Child's Eye

In Bangkok, six young people on vacation find themselves stranded at an airport due to a riot. A driver takes them to the Chung Tai Hotel, run by Chuen (Lam Ka-tung), where Rainie (Rainie Yang) sees a female ghost and Ling (Elanne Kwong) finds a hovering hand trying to grab her. While at dinner the three men disappear. Rainie leads the girls with the aid of Man-man and her ghost-seeing dog Little Huang as they try to find them in the hotel's underground passages where they encounter the female ghost and a strange monster which is actually a dog human hybrid.[2]
