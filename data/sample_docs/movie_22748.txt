Red Amnesia

Red Amnesia follows a family living in modern Beijing. Deng Meijuan, a widowed lady, lives on her own in a small rundown flat. Her relationships with her sons are strained - Elder son, Jun, is married and lives in a comfortable and modern apartment with his family, while younger son, Bing, has a boyfriend who Deng pretends she does not know about. Deng visits her sons and elderly mother at a nursing home regularly.
Soon, Deng's comfortable life pattern is disrupted by strange occurrences, consequences of a decision she had made during the Cultural Revolution, that no doubt had impacted the lives of others in the present.
