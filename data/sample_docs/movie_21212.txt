Comes a Bright Day

Sam Smith, a bright, ambitious, handsome bellboy at a five-star hotel, has big dreams of running his own restaurant with his childhood friend. On a seemingly ordinary day, he suddenly finds himself in a life-or-death hostage situation with the radiantly beautiful Mary and her spirited elderly boss Charlie while running an errand at one of Londonâ€™s most exclusive jewelers.[2] Against the backdrop of an armed jewel robbery that goes badly wrong, hostages Sam and Mary discover their true feelings for each other when flung together by deadly circumstance.[3] At the conclusion of the situation, Charlie grants Sam his wish of running a restaurant by proposing a partnership with him. Mary tells her boss that she changed her plans of moving to Australia, and asks Sam to take her to a concert.
