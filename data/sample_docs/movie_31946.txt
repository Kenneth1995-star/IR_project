The three brothers raise Nandini like their own child as their parents had died. At the age of 5, an astrologer predicts that Nandini will bring much happiness to the family, but her marriage will be based on her choice and not the choice of her brothers. This angers the brothers and to prevent this from happening, she is raised within the confines of the house.She is home schooled and when she does go out, all the men are warned to hide from Nandini and that seeing Nandini will be met with dire consequences.

The few males allowed around her are the service staff and her bodyguards.Meanwhile, the boy who sang, Chanti (Venkatesh) grows up to be a naive and gullible simpleton with a heart of gold. He is raised by his widowed mother Kanthamma (Sujatha). He doesn't go to school and spends his time singing and entertaining the people of the village.
One day the bodyguards get into a fight with Chanti who beats them up.Impressed with Chanti's naivety and fighting skills, the Brothers hire Chanti to be Nandini's bodyguard and butler.

Chanti complies with her wishes and shows her the village which results in Nandini getting sick. Chanti is blamed for Nandini getting sick and gets beaten up by the brothers. Nandini who has just started to like Chanti feels guilty for being the reason for him getting trashed.
