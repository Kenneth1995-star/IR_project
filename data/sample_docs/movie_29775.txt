Thulasi

Thirunavukarasu (Major Sundarrajan) is like the God in his village. Nevertheless, his son Sammadham (Chandrasekhar) is an atheist and he doesn't believe in his father's power. Sammadham and Ponni (Thara), a low caste girl, fall in love with each other. Sammadham's best friend Siva (Murali), a low caste boy, passes the M.A degree successfully. Thulasi (Seetha), Thirunavukarasu's daughter, develops a soft corner for Siva.
Thirunavukarasu cannot accept for his son Sammadham's marriage with Ponni due to caste difference. Sammadham challenges him to marry her. Thirunavukarasu appoints henchmen to kill her and Ponni is found dead the next day in the water.
Siva also falls in love with Thulasi. The rest of the story is what happens to Siva and Thulasi.
