Priya

Priya (Sridevi) is a movie star, who is exploited by her producer Janardhan / K Ashwath (Major Sundarrajan). Janardhan has such a tight control over Priya's financial and personal affairs that he refuses to let her get married to her boyfriend Bharat (Ambarish).
Before she flies off to Singapore for a film shoot, Priya seeks the help of Lawyer Ganesh (Rajnikant) to get rid of Janardhan.
How Ganesh helps Priya overcome her problems accounts for the rest of this movie, which includes a side story of Ganesh falling in love with a Malay-Indian girl (Aznah Hamid).
The original story written by Sujatha was based in London setting with the Scotland Yard playing a central role. But the film adaptation chose a Singapore backdrop and no role for the police force.
