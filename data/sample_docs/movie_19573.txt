Out of the Shadow

Reporter Mark Kingston learns that his brother, who was studying at Cambridge University, has committed suicide. Unconvinced, he begins his own investigation when the police dismiss his suspicions. With the help of Mary Johnson, whose professor father has turned up missing, Kingston attempts to prove that there has been a murder and not a suicide on the campus.[2]
