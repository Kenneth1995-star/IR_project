Heaven or Vegas

Rachel (Yasmine Bleeth) is a woman looking for a way out of her dead-end existence. Six years after she ran away from her home in Utah, Rachel is living in Las Vegas, where she works as an exotic dancer and an occasional call girl.
Rachel lives in a fantasy world as a way of distancing herself from her bleak surroundings, and she imagines that a Prince Charming will one day rescue her from her fallen world. On the inside she is still a dreamy little girl who believes in fairy tales. She thinks that her prince may have finally arrived when she meets Navy (Richard Grieco), a high-class stud-for-sale who has tired of his humiliating life in the sex industry.
Navy is fond of Rachel, and when he decides to leave male prostitution behind and move to Montana to start a new life, she eagerly joins him. However, along the way she persuades him to make a stop in Utah so that she can check in with her family. Rachel and Navy discover that it's difficult to hide their respective pasts from Rachel's straightlaced family and that they're out of step with life in small town America.
Navy also finds himself attracted to Rachel's gorgeous and "virginal" stepsister, Lilli (Monica Potter), which leads a heartbroken Rachel to run away just as Navy realizes that Rachel is the one for him. Rachels sister Paige runs away looking for her and is taken hostage along with Rachel by drifters. Navy and Billy dramatically rescue them from the psychotic drifters. Later Rachel and Navy move to Montana to start their life together and they have two Sons.
