Ganesh (Ganesh) is the adopted younger brother of Devaraj. When Devaraj loses his right hand in an accident, Ganesh at a young age takes responsibility of his family. Devaraj's sister is in love with the son of Rangayana Raghu, who is unscrupulous and demands a huge dowry for the marriage to be made possible. To make this marriage possible Devaraj and Ganesh take a loan from a financier (Mohan Guneja) and invest it in an explosives business, only to lose it completely.
Simultaneously, Ganesh gets his phone muddled with Rekha (Rekha Vedavyas) on account of both the models being the same. Rekha's father Avinash is the boss of Rangayana Raghu. Ganesh and Rekha have loads of comical misunderstandings before falling in love and deciding to get married. Of course this is not acceptable to Avinash, and he puts obstacles in their way. The story is whether or not Ganesh and Rekha can overcome these obstacles.
