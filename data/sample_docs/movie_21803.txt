Spasms

Jason Kincaid (Oliver Reed) has a massive serpent captured in a remote island. He brought it to the US because it killed his brother, and he now shares some kind of psychic link with it. He enlists the help of psychologist Tom Brazilian (Peter Fonda) to study the animal and the mental connection, but they do not count on a group of snake worshiping Satanists to complicate matters by accidentally setting the beast free.
