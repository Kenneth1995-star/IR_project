Prithivirajan

The story is based on the popular folk legend Prithviraj, the king of Kanauj, of the Chauhan dynasty. Prithivirajan falls in love with Samyuktha the princess and daughter of the King of Delhi, Jayachandran. Though Prithivirajan and Jayachandran joined hands and defeated Mohammed Ghori, something happened and they became enemies. Jayachandran places a statue of Prithivirajan in the hall where Samyuktha is to choose her life partner from among the princes who were gathered there. She puts the garland to the statue of Prithivirajan. But, lo and behold, the statue turns into real life Prithivirajan who takes the hand of Samyuktha and off they went to the utter astonishment of King Jayachandran and others.
