From a small rural village, Easwaran (Srikanth) heads to the bigger city of Chennai with his father (Murali) seeking medicine to treat an illness. While in town, they live at the home of Eashwaran's brother (Shyam Ganesh), who's caught up in a dangerous web of corruption involving a thug named Aditya (FEFSI Vijayan). As Aditya continues to head dirty deals with local officials, Eashwaran is in over his head and may need his brother's help.
