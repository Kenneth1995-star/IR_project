Term of Trial

Graham Weir is an alcoholic schoolteacher whose criminal record for refusing to fight during the Second World War has prevented him from progressing further in his teaching career. Now, years later, he is a teacher in a school where pupils don't like to be there and is married to a very embittered wife. While in school, he meets Shirley Taylor, a new girl in the school who starts to have a crush on him. Graham does not realise it, but Shirley's infatuation will lead to serious trouble, including the threat of a false sexual molestation charge.
