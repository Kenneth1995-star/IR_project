Surya (Aryan Rajesh) is a man who hates love. But somehow he is charmed by Brinda (Anita Hassanandani). Brinda likes his attitude and admires him as a friend. But her admiration coupled with a few coincidences makes Surya think that she is in love him. When he is expecting her to speak those magical words (I love you), she introduces Surya to her fiance (Sai Kiran). After Brinda marries her beau, a damsel (Bhoomika Chawla) meets Surya and explains the flashback. That beautiful girl is a silent admirer of Surya and had been following him for years. She proposes to Surya when they were in college. Surya asks her to come back once he is financially settled, as love and life afterall need security. Finally Surya settles down with her and the movie ends on a happy note.
