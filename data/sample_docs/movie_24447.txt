Bade Sarkar

An elderly lady Rashmi (Kamini Kaushal), starts telling her story to a newly married couple she's giving shelter to as their car has broken down. The story in flashback, is set twenty years earlier. The wealthy landowner, Zamindar Mansingh, is oppressive and demanding of the people in his state. Rashmi and her family have just arrived in Gangapur as guests of Mansingh. Rashmi is captured by the dreaded dacoit Black Bandit. The Bandit releases Rashmi but keeps her jewellery. She notices a mark on the bandit's hand, which is also present on Pratap's hand. Pratap is the oldest son of Mansingh, and Rashmi realises that he's the bandit. Pratap also suffers from a heart problem unknown to the others. It's soon revealed that Pratap is the bandit and his father asks him to leave the house. When Pratap has a heart attack, his father relents and hands over the running of the property to him. Rashmi stays by his side and they get married. The flashback ends with the couple asking about Pratap's fate. Pratap is shown opening the gate of the house, returning from a fishing trip, having managed to survive the doctor's prognosis given twenty years back.
