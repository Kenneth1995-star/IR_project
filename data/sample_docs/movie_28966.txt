Adhithan Kanavu

Two cousins serves as commanders in the army of a Kingdom. They make an agreement. When they marry and have children, if one gets a son and the other a daughter, then the children should marry each other. However, due to some differences, the cousins parted from each other and one of them leaves the country. Both of them marry and in due course both beget children. A boy to one and a girl to the other. The children grow up in different places. One day Gandharvas (heavenly beings) bring them together and they marry according to Gandharva custom. The Gandharvas then take both to their respective homes. This happens during the night. The following morning the man goes in search of his sweetheart. The girl becomes pregnant and undergoes severe harassment. A song, taught to the man by his mother, becomes the clue and brings back the estranged families back together.[2]
