Pookari

Valli (Manjula) is a flower seller and her brother Srinivasan is a real estate broker. One day, Valli meets a young man (Muthu) and they fall in love. Meanwhile, there is a wealthy man (V. K. Ramasamy) with a daughter, Shyamala (Nirmala). He has a nephew Ravi (Ambarish) who is a womaniser. Although Ravi has a mistress (Jayamala), he is also after Muthu's sister (Jayachitra), who he eventually rapes. Traumatised by the incident, she loses her voice. Ravi and Muthu fight frequently, but during one such incident, Jayachitra pleads with Muthu to spare Ravi. During that incident, she also regains her voice and Ravi agrees to marry her. Upon realising this, a shocked Jayamala plans to go to the wedding hall in disguise, with a hidden gun, and shoot Ravi dead. Shyamala learns of Jayamala's plans and rushes to save Ravi, but Valli takes the bullet instead. Before dying, she manages to unite Shyamala and Muthu. Ravi and Jayachitra marry.[2]
