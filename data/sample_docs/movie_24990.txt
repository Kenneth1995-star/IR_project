Naresh is married to Sudha (Aruna Irani) and Ramesh to Shobha (Alka). Seema stays away for studies in a hostel. When the family learns about Raghu's retirement, they are excited about getting his retirement benefits. When Raghu informs them that he has cleared his debts with this amount and plans to depend on his sons, everyone is disappointed. Naresh informs his plans to shift to Bombay and he can accommodate his mother while Ramesh informs that he can accommodate father. Thus the parents are bound to live separately with the sons. In Bombay, Sarojini's life is confined within the house and is ill-treated. On the other hand, Raghu is dependent on his son's family. After visiting her parents, Seema decides to take an extreme step for their solace and to the surprise of her boyfriend Ajay (Vinod Mehra) and the Shukla family.
