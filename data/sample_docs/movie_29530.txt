Mogam Muppadhu Varusham

The story revolves around five people. Kamal Haasan, a city bred is married to Sumithra, a village girl. On the other hand, Vijayakumar, a village lad and Phataphat Jayalakshmi, a modern woman are married. Jayalakshmi hates living with her husband (Vijayakumar) as he doesn't show interest in sex life. Meanwhile, Sripriya, a young girl wants at least to have a child with Kamal Haasan, attracted by him even if he doesn't marry her. As the title suggests, the film ends with these people overcoming all their issues and living happily, except Sripriya who commits suicide.
