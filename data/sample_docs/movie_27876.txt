Shambu

Journalist Meera (Karthika Mathew) starts working on a documentary related to the pros and cons of campus politics. Their main topic was a bus fire tragedy which happened 5 years ago, owing to which Sambhu (Vijayakumar ) and his collegemates were put to jail. Sambhu and his friends had attacked and damaged a bus on a strike day, which had ultimately set the bus on fire. In the tragic incident, Sambhuâ€™s sister was also put to death as she was one among the commutators in that bus. The sight of his sister being burnt to death makes Shambu mentally disturbed.
The film deals with the investigation of Meera on the case to find out the truth.
