Arjun, Laila, Chaya Singh

Surya (Arjun), assisted by Baby (Laila), is a conman whose services can be bought by anyone for the right price. His tricks result in the dismissal of both the Assistant Commissioner (Ilavarasu) and his brother, the Police minister (Rajkapoor). So they seek the help of Pasupathy (Sobhraj), another dada in Madras. When Pasupathy is recruited by a goon from Calcutta to kidnap the Kancheepuram collector, Surya decides to foil his plan and save the collector. When saving the man, he finds that the collector Jai Anand (Arjun) is a spitting image of himself. Jai's fiancee Priya (Chaya Singh) tells Surya about Jai's past as the collector in Calcutta.
