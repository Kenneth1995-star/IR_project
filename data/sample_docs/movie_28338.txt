Karma Yodha (കർമ്മയോദ്ധാ)

Madhavan Menon (Maddy) is a ruthless investigating officer working with the Mumbai Police. He is an encounter specialist who makes decisions on the spot, without always waiting for orders from the top. His latest assignment is to investigate the missing of a teenage school girl from Mumbai. He reaches Kerala on being tipped off that the girl could be taken to Kerala. In the meantime, another girl gets kidnapped in Kerala, presumably by the same people or people linked to them. There is also information that some other girls too have been kidnapped. Following the leads, Maddy comes to the conclusion that all the girls have been abducted by a Kerala-based sex trafficking racket headed by a psycho criminal named Khais Khanna. Maddy embarks on a mission to eliminate the racket and save the girls, including his daughter who gets kidnapped, Diya.
The film depicts children being trapped by mafia groups taking advantage of technology like mobile phones, and dwells on the international sex trafficking. The film also depicts the diminishing joint family system in society, suggesting that with the increasing trend towards the nuclear family in society, what is getting uprooted is the bonding between family members and the security that they offer along with love and affection to the future generation.
