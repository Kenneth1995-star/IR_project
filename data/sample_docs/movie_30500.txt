Villain

They are identical twins in the movie: Shiva and Vishnu (both played by Ajith Kumar). Shiva, the elder one, is a bus conductor, while Vishnu, the younger one, has a mild intellectual disability. Shiva overhears his parents' plot to kill Vishnu. He runs away to another city with Vishnu, and strives hard to look after him.
As a result of an incident when 'dada' Sundaramoorthy (FEFSI Vijayan), who runs a beggar trade, beats Vishnu brutally, so Vishnu becomes handicapped for life. Shiva leaves Vishnu in a home run by a social worker (Sujatha). During the day, Shiva works as a bus conductor, and at the same time, poses as the handicapped Vishnu: to play Robin Hood and steal from the rich and corrupt. A gang including Thangam (Meena), Ramesh Khanna, and others assist him in these operations. He is never suspected, and so, with the stolen money, he takes care of not only Vishnu, but also 800 people in other institutions for the physically handicapped.
A college student Lavanya (Kiran Rathod) falls in love with Shiva, but Shiva later comes to know that she is the sister-in-law of Sundaramoorthy, the 'dada' who handicapped Vishnu. Matters worsen when Sundaramoorthy becomes the chairman of the institute for the physically disabled. How Shiva deals with the situation forms the rest of the story. Meanwhile, Thangam is in love with Shiva, though he does not know this. Later she gives up her love and lets Lavanya marry Shiva. At last, Shiva marries Lavanya and Thangam marries Vishnu.
