All for Mary

Filmed on location in Switzerland the story concerns two young bachelors taking separate skiing holidays at the same resort. Clive Morton (Nigel Patrick) and "Humpy" Miller (David Tomlinson) have nothing whatsoever in commonâ€”except for one thing, both men fall for the hotel proprietor's daughter Mary (Jill Day). As the story progresses Clive, a debonair soldier and sportsman gets quickly into his stride as poor "Humpy" a clumsy, incongruous fellow looks on dumbly.
However, "Humpy" has a secret weapon, Miss Cartwright (Kathleen Harrison) his former nanny who arrives just as the pair are quarantined in the hotel attic after contracting measles. Quickly realising Humpy's predicament she skillfully arranges for the removal of the opposition, leaving the way clear for "Humpy".
