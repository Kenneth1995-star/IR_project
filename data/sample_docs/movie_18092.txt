Under the terms of his uncle's will, John Strong (Eric Bransby Williams) must go to Thursday Island and find a pearl within two years or the Reuben Strong pearling station and his great wealth will revert to another, Black Darley (Jameson Thomas). Eventually Strong finds the pearl, defeats Darley and discovers romance with the daughter (Lillian Douglas) of an island trader (W.G. Saunders).[1]
