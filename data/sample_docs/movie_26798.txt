Sadda Adda

The film depicts how six bachelors live together, despite their completely different backdrops and personalities like bihari Safal Yadav Manpaur (Madhubani).[citation needed] Their home, which they call "Sadda Adda", is an absolute mess of beer bottles, dirty clothes, and mattresses, yet together, they carry out the tasks of cooking, cleaning and paying the rent, while sharing laughter and tears, and always standing up for each other like a family. "Sadda Adda" starts as a midway room to assist them while they work towards their dreams, but turns out to become their true home.[2]
