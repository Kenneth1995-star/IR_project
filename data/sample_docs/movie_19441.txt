Devil's Bait

An incompetent rat-catcher leaves behind some of the poison he has used to eradicate rats from a small bakery, and the husband-and-wife bakery team inadvertently bake poison into a batch of bread. When they realize what they have done they try to retrieve the contaminated bread they have sold before anyone eats it.
