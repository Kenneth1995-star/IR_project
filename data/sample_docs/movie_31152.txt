Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya

Shiva (Sethu), Kaliyaperumal (Santhanam), and Power Kumar (Srinivasan) are three friends with no occupation other than getting drunk and chasing girls. A pretty girl named Sowmiya (Vishaka) moves in with her family to the house opposite Shiva. The three friends fall for the girl's beauty and make a gentlemen's agreement to let the girl choose her boyfriend. The three attempt different methods to woo her. Shiva helps Sowmiya's aunt (Kovai Sarala) in household work; Kaliyaperumal joins Sowmiya's uncle (Ganesh) to learn singing; Power joins Sowmiya's father (Shivshankar) to learn Bharatanatyam. One day, when none of her other family members are home, the three eventually profess their love, leaving Sowmiya confused. Following the advice of her neighbour (Devadarshini), Sowmiya reveals to all three that she loves actor Silambarasan, nicknamed Simbu. The neighborhood boys then decide to bring Simbu as a gift for Sowmiya's birthday, but Simbu says he does not know anyone named Sowmiya. They then hire a thug named "Kolaveri" David to kidnap Simbu, but he kidnaps Sowmiya instead when he learns he is supposed to kidnap Simbu. After Simbu refuses to help her, Shiva, KK and Power go and save Sowmiya from David, and she falls in love with Shiva, because Power and KK had earlier beaten Sowmiya's uncle and father severely; they later marry.
