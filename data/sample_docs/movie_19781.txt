The Knack â€¦and How to Get It

The nervous schoolteacher Colin, observing the sexual revolution in London, has little personal sexual experience and wishes to gain "the knack", a way to seduce women. He turns to a friend, an aggressive, womanizing drummer known only by his surname, Tolen. Tolen gives him unhelpful advice to consume more protein and use intuition, acknowledging intuition is not something that can be completely learned, and espouses the importance of domination. He then suggests Colin move into his residence, where he and another friend "share" women. Colin also becomes determined to obtain a larger bed.
While Colin works on his new living arrangements, a young virginal woman named Nancy arrives to London from out of town, searching for the YWCA. She stops by a clothing store and is won over by the flattery of the clerk, until she overhears him repeating the same words to every female customer. While still seeking the YWCA and asking strangers for directions, she sees Colin purchasing a large cast iron bed. She helps Colin and his friends bring the bed to their residence. There, Tolen makes sexual advances on her, and gives her an unwanted kiss, though telling her she will not be "raped" without consent.
In a public space, Tolen pursues Nancy again, and she faints. When she wakes up, she begins claiming she was raped, though this was not the case. Tolen, Colin and their friends find themselves unable to restrain her from loudly repeating the allegations, or slashing the tires of Tolen's motorcycle, and she runs back to the residence, where she breaks Tolen's records and strips naked. The men become convinced her rape allegations reflect fantasy and urge Tolen to have sex with her. When Nancy emerges from the room wearing a robe, she instead expresses more attraction to Colin, and he returns the interest. Some time later, there is gossip that Nancy and Colin will be co-habitating.
