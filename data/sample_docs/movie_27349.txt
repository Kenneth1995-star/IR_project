Aramane

Arun (Ganesh) is a photographer employed in a studio in Mysore. Also living in the city is a very wealthy Rajashekhara Aras (Anant Nag), in his palatial house, now a loner separated from his family, and has become a hard drinker, living with his manservant Basava (Karibasavaiah). Arun is called one day to Aras' house to get his photo clicked for an official document. They befriend over a drink, when Aras reveals to Arun of his children having left him when they learn of his decision to remarry on his wife's passing, twenty-two years ago. He wishes of getting a photo clicked with his family one last time and pleads Arun to unite him with his three children who are now living Sydney, Bangalore, and Washington, D.C.. Arun, initially reluctant, sees his distress and assures.
On learning that the husband of Aras' eldest daughter is a Police commissioner in Bangalore, he acquires their residential address and befriends the couple's younger daughter Neethu (Tejaswini Prakash). She is shocked on his revealing of her grandfathers existence, who had always thought that he was dead as told by her parents.
