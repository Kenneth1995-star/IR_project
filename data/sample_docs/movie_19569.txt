No Love for Johnnie

Johnnie is re-elected with the ruling Labour Party, but is disappointed not to receive an invitation to join the Government. As his wife leaves him, he joins a conspiratorial group working against the centrist government. Mary, the single woman upstairs adores him but they never quite become a couple. Johnnie falls in love with a 20-year-old student/model Pauline, and misses an important speech because he is in bed with her. His conspirators turn against him and cause his constituents to attempt to unseat him. He narrowly escapes a vote of no-confidence in his constituency, and goes in search of Pauline who has ended their relationship, still in love, but knows it is not the right relationship for her. He goes back home, to find his wife wants to try again and she gives him her contact phone number. The Prime Minister offers him a post, and reveals that the reason Johnnie was not offered one before was due to his wife's communist connections. Johnnie tears up the paper with his wife's phone number and embraces his role in government.
