White Settlers

Married couple Ed (Lee Williams) and Sarah (Pollyanna McIntosh) have decided that they want to get away from their busy, stressful lives in London and move somewhere more peaceful. They believe that they've found the perfect place in a bucolic farmhouse in Scotland; however, their real estate agent Flo (Joanne Mitchell) informs them that the land is the site of a gruesome battle between the English and the Scottish. Despite this knowledge and Flo's chilly demeanor, Ed and Sarah choose to purchase the farmhouse and restore the property. Initially all seems well, but on their first night they hear strange sounds in the nearby area and discover that they are not at all welcome in the area.
