Jiao Yulu

In late 1962, Jiao Yulu was appointed the second party boss of Lankao County in Henan province. This region declined into poverty and ignorance. The local residents had to contend with wind and sand storms, waterlogging, and alkaline lands. He was soon promoted to party boss because of his excellent work. Due to years of toil, Jiao Yulu broke down from constant overwork and suffered from liver cancer. On May 14, 1964, he died at the age of forty-two.
