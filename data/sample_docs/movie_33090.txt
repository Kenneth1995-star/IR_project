Denziman Movie

3000 years ago, the Vader Clan, led by Queen Hedrian, devastated the planet Denzi. Denziland, an island from Denzi, landed on Earth. In modern times, the computer of Denziland awoke the Denzidog IC when it detected the Vader Clan approaching Earth. IC found five young people (who may or may not be descendants of the Denzi people) to become the Denzimen in order to defend Earth, the Vader Clan's next target.
