Coastal Command

In 1942, a Sunderland flying boat with Pilot Roger Hunter and Flight Sergeant Charles Norman Lewis as crew, set out on a patrol, flying out of their Scotland air base.
During the routine sea patrol, in which a convoy is spotted, the crew encounters and bombs a German U-boat. [Note 1]
The Sunderland's crew returns to England, mission accomplished, but with a wounded crew member aboard, who is in stable condition. After a visit to the hospital, the Sunderland crew is informed they will be re-deployed to West Africa, to begin a new mission.
