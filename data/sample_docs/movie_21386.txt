For Those in Peril

Aaron, a young misfit living in a remote Scottish fishing community, is the lone survivor of a strange fishing accident that claimed the lives of five men including his older brother. As the sole survivor the community ostracise Aaron and treat him as partially responsible for the tragedy.
Spurred on by sea-going folklore and local superstition, the village blames Aaron for this tragedy, making him an outcast amongst his own people, who call him a Jonah. Steadfastly refusing to believe that his brother Michael has died, he seeks help of other fishermen to take him out to sea to search, but all refuse. He therefore sets out alone to recover him and the rest of the men, capturing the constant fear of such loss.
