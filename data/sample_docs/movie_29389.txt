Thanga Thambi

Varadan (Sundarrajan) marries Sundari (Vanisri). He wants his younger brother Venu (Ravichandran) to marry a rich woman, but Sundari wants a poor and obedient sister-in-law. Although Sundari initially refuses pregnancy for fear of ruining her looks, she eventually bears a child at the same time as the meek sister-in-law Parvathi (Bharati). Parvathi raises both children, causing an estrangement between the brothers.[1]
