The film has a "different" type of plot relative to many bollywood movies. In a school yard fight, 18-year-old Dhruv Mathur (Adarsh Gourav) impetuously hits a fellow student, breaking his leg. He then gets scared and runs away. When the school expels him, his parents send him to a boarding school. Away from home in the boarding school, Dhruv is ignorant about the ongoing crisis in his family. His life takes an unexpected turn as he gets the news of his father Diwakar Mathur's (Manoj Bajpayee) death in a car accident. As he copes with the tragedy, he seeks to find out what happened. Hidden truths begin to unravel. Even as his mother Nandini (Smita Tambe) struggles to shield him, Dhruv starts looking for answers. The search leads to a series of unexpected revelations, as he discovers the shades of his fatherâ€™s personality and his business situation he had never known before. He discovers that his father's business partner, Robin (Kumud Mishra), was involved in shady business dealings and that his father was a good man. Dhruv believes that Robin, his father's crooked business partner, must have had his father murdered. The reality turns out to be something else and Dhruv's mother was trying to withhold information in order to protect Dhruv. Turns out Dhruv's father had borrowed money to pay the workers at his unexpectedly closed factory. The film has an unexpected ending when he is shocked to discover that his father had essentially committed suicide in order to keep his word to pay back the loan he took from a bank owner, and to leave some money for Dhruv and his mother. Dhruv grows up in this process and decides to seek and apologize to the boy he had struck in school a few years earlier. [1]
