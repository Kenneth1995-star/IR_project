Loot

The setting is a seaside hotel owned by a Mr. McLeavy in the 1960s in England. The owner’s son, Hal (Roy Holder), and Hal's boyfriend, Dennis (Hywel Bennett), rob a bank located next to the funeral parlour where Dennis works. They hide the money in the coffin of Hal’s mother, who has just died and whose body has been returned to the hotel prior to its final burial. Inspector Truscott (Richard Attenborough) investigates the bank robbery and immediately suspects Hal and Dennis. Meanwhile, Mr. McLeavy (Milo O'Shea) is being aggressively courted by Fay McMahon (Lee Remick), the nurse who cared for Hal’s ailing mother in her last weeks of life. McMahon is having an affair with Dennis, who is proudly bisexual, but she has no real interest in him until he tells her he has come into money. Inspector Truscott also has a particular interest in Nurse McMahon, he is sure she murdered several of her former husbands, and also thinks she poisoned Hal's mother. Truscott’s investigations, and Dennis and Hal’s ongoing measures to get away with the proceeds of the bank robbery, make up the action in "Loot".
