Inspector Shankar (Biswajeet) is assigned to investigate the mysterious death of Sunder Singh (Sujit Kumar), whose ship wrecks on a stormy night. Sunder was off to marry Sheila (Mala Sinha), the daughter of his mother's (Nirupa Roy) childhood friend who had long since died. Sheila was raised by her father, who dies of a heart attack when he comes to know of Sunder's death. Sunder's mother decides to take Sheila to live with her. In denial of her son's death, Sunder's mother keeps doing various acts in madness. She keeps serving food for Sunder, talks with his photos, and keeps feeling that her son has returned. Meanwhile, Shankar and Sheila fall in love. But in her madness, Sunder's mother starts preparations of Sunder's wedding with Sheila. Sunder's face-burnt body is found and the mystery continues whether his death was an accident or a murder.
