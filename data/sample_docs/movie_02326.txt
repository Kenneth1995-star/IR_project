Wine, Women and Horses

His gal pal Valerie buys compulsive gambler Jim a meal after he goes broke. Jim takes off for points unknown and, stopping in a small Midwest town, he wins $20 off of George Mayhew in a game of horseshoes, then returns the money when he learns George can't afford to lose it.
Jim takes a liking to George's sister, Marjorie, and it's mutual. She spurns her beau Pres to marry Jim, despite her reservations about his gambling. Jim promises to get a job and does, as a Chicago hotel's night manager. A guest there, Bright, is impressed with Jim's $300 win in a dice game. Jim accepts his job offer to look after Bright's racehorses, but Marjorie leaves him.
Valerie teams up with Jim for a $20,000 racetrack payday. He has lost his wife, however, returning home to find she's in love with Pres now and wants a divorce. Jim has a new horse, Lady Luck, and realizes now that Val will become more than just a pal.
