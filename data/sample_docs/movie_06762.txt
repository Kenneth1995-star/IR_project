Eighteen and Anxious

Judy Graham, just 18 years old, elopes to Mexico with boyfriend Jack, only to have him killed there. Judy returns to the disapproval of mother Lottie and stepfather Harvey, as well as disbelief from Jack's parents, the Baynes, who doubt the girl's story and accuse her of loose morals.
Judy realizes she is pregnant. She and older friend Ava go to Tijuana to find the marriage license, but no paperwork for a "Bayne" is found. She eventually gives birth to a baby boy, but doesn't wish to see him. Lottie has a change of heart and cares for the child. Jack's parents discover the wedding license in their son's belongings, mistakenly listed as "Payne," and forgive Judy, but she's appalled by their hypocrisy.
After finding a job and beginning a relationship with a boy, Danny Fuller, a smooth talker named Pete Bailey seduces her, only to jilt Judy on what she believes is her wedding day. A car she mistook as a marriage gift is actually a goodbye from Pete, who abandons her. A distraught Judy gets into a car crash. Danny rescues her from the wreck, expressing his hope that everyone will make up to Judy for their previous behavior toward her.
