The File of the Golden Goose

A trail of counterfeit hundred dollar bills has been discovered in several places around the world. When this comes to the attention of the Secret Service, they assign one of their top men, Pete Novak (Yul Brynner), to the case of finding out who is producing and distributing them.
Pete realizes that this is an assignment that demands his full attention, so he immediately breaks up with his girlfriend in preparation for the journey he must take. Before Pete can even begin his search, he is ambushed by a gang of hoodlums trying to shoot him down as they drive by outside his home. He concludes that the gang must have been tipped off by someone on the inside of the service about his new assignment. He manages to kill them, but discovers afterwards that the killers has accidentally shot and killed his ex-girlfriend in the process.
The killing of the girlfriend makes the whole assignment very personal for Pete. To begin the search for the counterfeit distributor, he travels across the Atlantic to London, England, to visit the Scotland Yard headquarters, since they are in charge of the counterfeit investigation in Europe. There, he meets up with Superintendent Sloane (John Barrie) of the Yard, who arranges for him to be partnered by an investigator by the name of Arthur Thompson (Edward Woodward). Arthur is a very happily married jolly old copper, who manages to ignore all of Peteâ€™s remarks about the inappropriateness of being a married man working as an agent or policeman.
Pete and Arthur start infiltrating the counterfeit organization, posing as members of the Golden Goose gang - a gang that has been all but erased from the face of the earth by the police. They use their fake identities to hide their undercover infiltration from the head of the illegal operation, The Owl Harrison (Charles Gray), and are ultimately successful in stopping the counterfeit operation.[4]
