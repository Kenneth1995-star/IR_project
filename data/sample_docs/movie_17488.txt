Tim

It is the story of the developing relationship between an older, educated & wealthy American woman, Mary Horton (played by Piper Laurie) who lives on her own and a handsome, developmentally impaired 24-year-old builder's labourer, Tim Melville (played by Mel Gibson), whom she hires. Tim lives with his sister, Dawnie (Deborah Kennedy), who is a year older than he is, and their parents Ron (Alwyn Kurts) and Emily (Pat Evison). Dawnie marries her boyfriend, Mick Harrington (David Foster). Dawnie and Mick make clear they dislike Mary and oppose her relationship with Tim, but do not state their reason for feeling that way. Tim eventually marries Mary.
