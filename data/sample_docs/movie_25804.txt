Guddu

Guddu Bahadur (Shah Rukh Khan) is the only child in the Bahadur family, consisting of Advocate Vikram (Mukesh Khanna) and his wife, Kavita (Deepti Naval). While Kavita is a devout and a religious Hindu, Vikram is an atheist. Guddu and Salina Gupta (Manisha Koirala) are in love. One day while driving, they have an accident and Salina loses her sight. Guddu blames himself and so do Salina's parents. Guddu is asked to keep away from Salina. Salina herself knows that the accident was not Guddu's fault, but would not like to meet Guddu and be a burden on him. Guddu overhears a conversation between their family doctor and his dad and he comes to know that he has a brain tumor. He has only a few more months to live. He wants to donate his eyes to the hospital so Salina can benefit from them, but his dad will not even consider this. Things take a turn for the worse, when Guddu decides to go to court to assert his right to donate his eyes, his dad ends in the hospital and so does Guddu. Kavita couldn't bear the trauma of her husband's illness and her son's disease, thus she decides to devote herself to god for five days without drinking a sip of water. Her prayers get answered and her husband's life is saved and her son's operation is successful. She dies at the feet of god while praying and her eyes get donated to Salina. Salina and Guddu get married and are blessed with twins and they live happily ever after.
