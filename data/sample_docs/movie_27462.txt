Kaddipudi

Anand (Shivrajkumar) was nicknamed "Kaddipudi" as his grandmother used to sell the tobacco products. He is associated to a shady politician (Sharath Lohitashwa), whose rivalry with others has resulted in many deaths. He is unwittingly caught in the crossfire and even attempts to relinquish his life of crime and lead a normal life. A saint in the form of a Police officer helps him in this quest, but there are other forces that would not let him have a normal life. His entanglement in this web of fraud and deceit forms the story.
