Durai

Raja (Arjun) works with a cook Arusuvai Ambi (Vivek). Raja comes across Anjali (Kirat Bhattal), who catches his interest. She falls for Raja, but he cannot remember anything of his past. All he recollects are vague images and memories that disturb him in his sleep. After a sequence of events and a chase by rowdies, Raja collects his past.
Raja, a year ago, was Durai, the close associate of honest politician Deivanayagam (K. Viswanath). Durai, who leads a happy life with his wife Meena (Gajala) and son, is hesitant to assume the post. Anjali, a reporter, pursues him for interviews and falls in love. Deivanayagam is killed, and the blame falls on Dorai. His wife and son are murdered. Eventually, Dorai alias Raja takes on his enemies and cracks the truth behind Deivanayakam's death. Action oozes all the way.
