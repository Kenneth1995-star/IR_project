Chatur Singh Two Star

Bumbling cop Chatur Singh (Sanjay Dutt) is sent on a special mission to South Africa to solve a high-profile case involving the murder of a politician and a cache of diamonds. But before he can redeem his botched-up career he must deal with a bunch of loonies which includes a crazy mafia don (Satish Kaushik), a weird taxi driver (Sanjai Mishra), a hysterical boss (Anupam Kher), and a pretty damsel in distress (Ameesha Patel).[4]
