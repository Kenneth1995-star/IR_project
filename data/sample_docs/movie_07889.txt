The New Interns

After a nervous breakdown, Dr. Alec Considine comes back to New North Hospital for another year of internship. He develops an immediate attraction for a student nurse, Laura Rogers, but she's not so inclined unless he's got marriage in mind.
Social worker Nancy Terman is sexually assaulted by juvenile delinquents who grew up in the same neighborhood as Dr. Dom Riccio of the hospital's staff. New intern Dr. Tony Pirelli quarrels with Riccio and falls in love with Nancy as well.
As other personal dramas occur, including newlywed Dr. Lew Worship discovering he is sterile and cannot have children, Nancy's attackers end up in a fracas at the hospital and Alec ends up injured. After his recovery, Alec decides to marry Laura and remain on New North's staff.
