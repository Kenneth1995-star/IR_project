The film opens with Shiva going to college for an exam, where his pen runs out of ink. He receives a new one from the girl next to him, Sindhya. He immediately falls for her and starts following her. He attends an educational tour with Sindhya, Vasanth, and Priya (Vasanth's lover). Eventually, Sindhya falls for Shiva too. He then finds out that she got the top rank in the test and a scholarship to the US. Before she leaves, Sindhya invites Shiva to breakfast at her house while her family is out. At her house, Shiva strips her and the two end up having sex. Sindhya then goes to the US. She comes back three months later, saying that she has some private information to tell him. When she gets back, she announces to Shiva that she is pregnant, thinking that no one else is in the house. However, Shiva's mom and dad overhear and they scold the two for having sex.
The film skips ahead a few years to show Shiva and Sindhya, husband and wife, having a child. Sindhya is working while Shiva is an unemployed husband, looking after the child at home. Sindhya's brother Randy, a psychiatrist, tries to help by setting up a trick for Shiva to discover his interests. He sets up a plot in which Shiva overhears Sindhya talking to a person named Mahesh who is really Randy, making Shiva think that the child is not his, but someone else's. Sindhya and Randy want Shiva to overhear them talking. Shiva gets suspicious about who Mahesh is and starts getting data from the library, helped by Vasanth. The climax is in the people he meets and he finally figures who it is. He accuses Sindhya and tries to kill the child. His family and Randy then explain what happened. He then rewrites the test and passes. The movie ends with Shiva getting a job and Randy still on his case on whether he is back to normal.
