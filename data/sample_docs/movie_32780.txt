LIE

A. Sathyam (Nithiin) is a good-for-nothing son of a widowed mother. He is unemployed and lives off of his father's monthly pension. He is unmarried and fantasizes about marrying an American girl. By a quirk of fate, Sathyam, along with a stranger Chaitra (Megha Akash), who has a dream to win a lot of money. The two end up in Las Vegas, where they decide to only lie with one another. Shortly after, they start to fall in love with one another through their beautiful lies.
At the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a frustrated officer Bharadwaj (Ravi Kishan) is desperate to nab an elusive criminal, Padmanabham (Arjun), who has escaped the long arm of the law for 19 years. Padmanabham is a famous Indian ropewalker and magician. But, he is also a master of disguise. Thus, the NIA has no idea how this criminal even looks like. He is now suspected to be residing in the USA. Bharadwaj has drafted a sharp officer Aadi (Srikanth) to go discover Padmanabham's hideout and identity by following a suit which he has purchases and is assumed to have an obsession with. The operation of this mission is called Sholay, which is implying that Aadi is the showman. All along, Padmanabham tries to go after the team which is trying to trace him, only to end up with Sathyam. Sathyam was a part of this operation the whole time. The rest of the film is about how Sathyam is related to the entire operation floated to crack Padmanabham, and how the hero-villain duo and other characters race against time.
In the end, Sathyam kills Padmanabham for good.
