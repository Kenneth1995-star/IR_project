Rama Rama Kya Hai Drama

The story revolves around Santosh (Rajpal Yadav) who is married to Shanti (Neha Dhupia). Santosh works at a bank in Mumbai and is a very simple man. However, his simplicity and lack of tactfulness often sees him engage in domestic altercations with Shanti. The regular fights start taking their toll on Santosh's work life, also where he is often looked down by his boss Prem (Aashish Chaudhary) who is always bragging about how smooth his own married life is and how understanding his wife Khushi (Amrita Arora) is. But the reality is that his wife also nags him a lot and he is as disturbed at times as Santosh.
The film takes many twists and turns including many scenes in which Santosh imagines that he is the boyfriend or husband of other random women. In the end this lands him in trouble with the police but finally when Shanti bails him out, the two come to terms with each other and realize that such things are a normal part of every marriage and they must learn to live with it.
