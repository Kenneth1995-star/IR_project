Rishte Naate

Thakur Narendrapal Singh (Nazir Hussain) is a generous and kind-hearted landlord and zamindar. He has a daughter Kalpana (Jamuna) and a son Raja (Deven Verma). Distrusting his son and his new wife, Roopa (Ameeta), he asks a village laborer, Sunder (Raaj Kumar) who is honest, loyal and hardworking, to marry his daughter. In this manner, Sunder and Kalpana get married, and soon Roopa gives birth to a daughter Meenakshi (Baby Shakila). Roopa was not taking good care of her own daughter. Sunder and Kalpana raise Meenakshi as their own daughter and give her a lot of love. Meenakshi was so attached with Sunder and Kalpana, that she thinks they are her real parents and refuses to call her own parents Mother and Father. Tragically, Kalpana passes away, and the Thakur, Sunder, and the child are devastated. The Thakur asks Sunder to get married to Savitri (Nutan), who is the daughter of his childhood friend, the local Collector (David). He hopes that in this manner the child will get the love of a mother. Sunder reluctantly agrees, and soon Savitri and he get married. Savitri is unable to win the love of the child, nor does she get any affection from Sunder, as he is unable to get Kalpana out of his mind and thoughts. In the meantime, Roopa's dad (Jeevan) is plotting the death of Sunder, so that his daughter can take over the wealth of the Thakur after his death. Watch movie to know what happens next.
