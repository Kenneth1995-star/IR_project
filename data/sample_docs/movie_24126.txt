Arjun â€” Kalimpong E Sitaharan

Arjun is a sleuth cum science fiction character of Jalpaiguri created by famous Bengali writer Samaresh Majumdar for young children.[3] He wrote many stories in the Arjun series, namely Arjun Ebaar Kolkata-e, Arjun Beriye Elo, Arjun@bipbip.com and many more. This film is the first of the Arjun series based on Sitaharan Rahasya and Khunkharapi.[1] In the film, Arjun (Om) is seen solving a case with the help of his mentor and guide, Amol Shome (Sabyasachi Chakraborty) in Kalimpong. He is portrayed as a Gen X sleuth who doesn't own a mobile phone but can be seen riding a bike.[4]
Sita is a teenager, who is on the verge of adulthood. She was born and brought up in the U.S. and has been brought to Kalimpong as a preventive step of her father, who wants to keep her away from her boyfriend, whom he thinks to be a bad influence for her. She is looked after by her caretaker Neelam. Her father is afraid of an attack from goons who think that the masters plan of a monastery is hidden somewhere in his house. But later on, matters really get serious and deep because everyone seems to be involved in a kind of conspiracy and treachery. Climax is interestingly revealed by Amol da as the culprit being sita's father.[5]
