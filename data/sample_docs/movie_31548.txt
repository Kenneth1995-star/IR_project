Ardhangi

Zamindar Bhujangarao (Gummadi) has two sons. The elder son Raghunath Rao (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) born to his first wife is a retard. After her death, he married Rajeswari (Santha Kumari) and the couple has a son Nagendra Rao / Naagu (Jaggaiah) a man of vices. Impressed by the way Padma (Savitri) a village girl faced Naagu when he threatened to take their farm lands, the Zamindar fixes Naagu’s marriage with her. But Rajeswari vetoes the alliance and suggests to perform her marriage with Raghu. After marriage, Padma learns that Raghu became a retard due to the opium-fed during his childhood to put him to sleep by the maid, Ayamma (Vijayalakshmi). She takes up the task of making him normal and also keeping the whiplashing-Naagu at a distance from Raghu. The zamindar rewrites the will in Raghu’s name and dies. But Raghu leaves the property to the peeved Rajeswari and Nagu and goes to the village with his wife. Naagu brings his paramour Neelaveni (Surabhi Balasaraswati) who along with her entourage (Sivaramakrishnaiah, Kasipathi and Gangarathnam) eye Naagu’s property. When he learns that the farmers paid the tax to Raghu, an enraged Naagu goes to the village with a rifle. At the same time, Raghu brings the money to give it to him. A repentant Rajeswari along with Raghu reaches the village, to bring sense in Nagu. When she fails, she takes the rifle and aims at him. But the Padma shields him. Naagu is a changed man.
