Prema

Raja (ANR) accompanies his rich maternal uncle Sundara Rao (Doraswamy) to a hill resort to help the latter recoup his health. There he falls in love with Moti (Bhanumathi), a tribal woman, and she too responds. A tribal goon Parasuram (Mukkamala) is after Moti. One night, Sundara Rao suddenly develops chest pain and Raja rushes him to a city hospital. Moti’s parents, Khaderao (K.V. Subba Rao) and mother Bansi (Surabhi Kamala Bai) fix her marriage with Parasuram. Moti manages to escape. Meanwhile, Raja returns to the village, and, on knowing that Moti’s marriage is being performed with Parasuram, is dejected and leaves for the city. Moti, who is now in the city with the hope of meeting Raja, sees him with Latha (Sriranjani), daughter of Sundara Rao, and assumes they are married. Crestfallen, she runs madly in the streets and meets with a car accident. Sivaswamy (CSR), a beggar, saves her and takes her to his house. A drama contractor Raoji (Relangi) and his assistant (Sivarao) take Moti into their troupe and train her for the title role of Sakunthala in their drama. Raja and Latha attend the drama. The two lovers, Moti and Raja exchange notes about their single status and their love blossoms again. Latha and Sundara Rao plot to separate them and succeed in their attempt. Moti sacrifices her love for Latha and leaves for her village. Parasuram kills her when she refuses to yield to him and is in turn killed by her friendChimli. Raja gets to know the truth from Latha and rushes to the village to meet Moti. Latha follows him. Both pay their homage to Moti.[6]
