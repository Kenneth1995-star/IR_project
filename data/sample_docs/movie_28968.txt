Bilhaana

A king hires the poet Bilhana to educate his daughter, Yamini. To prevent having a romance developing between them, the king lies to Yamini that Bilhana is blind, and to Bilhana that Yamini is deformed. When they are to interact, he arranges a curtain between the two. One day, during a lesson, Bilhana is amused at the sight of the full moon in the sky. To express his feeling of rapture, he starts reciting a poem. At this, Yamini begins wondering how a blind man could sing about the beauty of the moon so well. She pulls down the curtain and finds that Bilhana is attractive and youthful. At the same time, Bilhana learns that Yamini is beautiful and not disfigured. The two fall in love, and decide to marry, much to the anger of the king, who sentences them both to death. When the king's friends and other people revolt against his decision, he yields, and the two lovers marry.[1]
