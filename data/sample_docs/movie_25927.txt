Achanak

Wealthy industrialist Yashpal Nanda (Saeed Jaffrey) is widowed, and lives with his daughter, Nisha (Pinky Singh), and two sons, Vijay (Rahul Roy), and Arjun (Govinda). He gets Nisha married to Nilesh (Dalip Tahil), while Vijay gets married to Madhu (Farah Naaz), and Yashpal is on the look-out for a suitable bride for Arjun. Arjun lives a charmed life, surrounded by the family he loves and working at his family's thriving business. Then he meets Pooja (Manisha Koirala), and his life gets even better. The two quickly fall in love. Yashpal is overjoyed and happy with Arjun's choice and cannot wait for them to get married. The Nanda family's world gets turned upside down when Nisha and then Vijay pass away suddenly, leaving the family devastated. Pooja is mistakenly convicted of murder, and Arjun must save her while he keeps up his family responsibilities, but his father soon meets a cruel end as well. The police arrive on the scene to arrest Arjun for murder. Now, on the run from both the police and the mysterious criminals, Arjun and Pooja work to expose the truth while evading a fate at the hands of either.
