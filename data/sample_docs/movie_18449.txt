Pearls Bring Tears

Madge Hart (Dorothy Boyd) borrows a pearl necklace to wear to a dance, but then accidentally breaks it. She is further concerned because the pearls were only on loan to her husband as security for a business deal. Madge then rushes the necklace to be repaired, but when it is stolen, further panic ensues.
