Dad or Papa

Abraham Schwartz, a bookkeeper living in a small town in Ukraine, makes everything possible to educate his son as a violinist and to send him to Moscow where the latter is educated, earns popularity and finds his love. But when the father comes to Moscow to see his son, the latter feels embarrassed of his "improper" origin, "ugly" look and behaviour. Soon a war erupts, and the home town is taken by Germans while the son serves in the army.
