Chandamama

Ranga Rao (Nagababu) a widower, landlord, and well- respected man, loves his beloved daughter Mahalakshmi (Kajal Aggarwal), a sweet, intelligent, innocent, and somewhat fun-loving girl who loves her father as much as he loves her, more than anything else. His brother also has a daughter Rani (Sindhu Menon) and a son (Satyam Rajesh). Rani is like a sister to Mahalakshmi and a second daughter to Ranga Rao. Rani is a hyper, whiny, talkative but fun-loving sweet girl. When Mahalakshmi returns from college, Ranga Rao realizes that she has grown up and decides to fix her marriage with Dhorababu (Siva Balaji), an innocent, good-natured and rather shy boy.
After the engagement, Mahalakshmi reveals to Dhorababu that in the city, she had fallen in love with Kishore (Navdeep), a mischievous and amiable youth. After spending the night with her, he made it clear that he was not interested in marrying her. Mahalakshmi says that she did not want to lie and cheat Dhorababu, because she knows he is good and deserves better. Dhorababu goes to meet Kishore, where he learns it was all a prank and that Kishore actually loves Mahalakshmi. He fakes an accident and brings Kishore to the village under the pretense of a doctor. Mahalakshmi forgives Kishore. Finding out the secret, Rani falls in love with Dhorababu and vice versa. They dare not tell anyone, however.
Ranga Rao misunderstands their feelings and fixes Rani's marriage with Kishore, to take place at the same time as Mahalakshmi's with Dhorababu. The four youngsters decide the only way left is to elope, though Mahalakshmi has mixed feelings about this, as she feels it would hurt her father. At the last minute, Mahalakshmi cannot go through with it and tearfully confesses the truth to her father. Luckily, Ranga Rao understands and has the girls marry their respective lovers.
