Gopal Krishna

The story is based in Gokul where the young playful Krishna resides with his foster mother Yashodha and father Nanda. He tends cows along with other young cowherds. Gokul is ruled by the despotic King Kamsa who has Krishna’s real parents in custody. He is intent on killing Krishna to prevent the prophecy of his death trough Krishna coming true. Krishna incites the village people against Kamsa’s oppressive regime. He prevents 500 cows being sent to Kamsa who demands that the people of Gokul do so. He battles Kama’s General Keshi and defeats him when he is sent to kill him. The only miracle shown in the film is when Kamsa unleashes rain (unlike the other Puranic stories where the rain is brought about by the Rain God Indra) and Krishna lifts the Govardhan hill to shelter the people under it.
