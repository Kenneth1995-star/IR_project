Coast of Skeletons

Following independence, the unnamed British colony where Commissioner Harry Sanders has been working for many years sacks its British police force. So Sanders returns to London, where he soon finds work for an insurance company, which wants him to oversee a project to dredge for diamonds in the shallow waters off South West Africa.
Sanders soon finds himself drawn into a web of insurance fraud, a secret hunt for World War II gold bullion, and a rivalrous love triangle between a flamboyant American diamond prospector, a former German U-Boat commander in the employ of the American, and the Germanâ€™s very young wife.
