The Wasted Times

Using a jumbled chronology, the movie depicts events in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Philippines between 1934 and 1945. The central characters are a Chinese gangster, Lu (Ge You); his brother-in-law, Watabe (Tadanobu Asano), who is Japanese but describes himself as Shanghainese and a film actress, Xiao Liu (Zhang Ziyi), who is married to Lu's boss but not faithful to him. Lu is ruthless, yet unwilling to collaborate with the Japanese as they prepare to invade China. Watabe pretends to oppose the Japanese military, but secretly works for them. Assigned to spirit Xiao Liu out of the city, he instead rapes her and imprisons her as a sex slave. At the end of the war, Lu and Xiao Liu travel to Luzon, where Watabe is a POW, to have their revenge.[5][6]
