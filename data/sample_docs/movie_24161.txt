Baari Tar Bangla

Roopchand Sen is a professional writer who can no longer write. When he determines that the problem is not physical, but psychological, he goes to see a psychiatrist, Abanti, who uncovers his life story.
A middle class boy, Roopchand was pushed by his mother to become a Bangla writer like Bengali icon Satyajit Ray. At first, Roopchand succeeded as an advertising writer, but when the economy went into a downturn, so did his career. His mother, disappointed in her ambitions for her son, committed suicide. Roopchand thereafter became a political writer on the urging of his father, but as politics and parties changed and the message he was asked to advocate kept altering, he eventually lost that career as well. Thereafter, he found he could not write in Bangla at all. So used to writing for others had he become that he was unable to express himself anymore.
Understanding his problem, Abanti urges him to be Roopchand, the copy writer once again. Roopchand finds a cause he cares about, the anti-eviction movement, and regains his ability to write.
