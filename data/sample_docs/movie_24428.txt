A rich businessman, Dayashankar Kumar (Shivraj), who is a widow, lives with his two young sons Ashok and Raj. When he catches the younger boy Raj stealing money, he punishes him and threatens to cut off his fingers. A frightened Raj runs away from home. Years pass and the older brother Ashok (Ashok Kumar), becomes the owner of his father's business and property, running Superior Motors, which also extends to Bombay. Ashok is married to Lakshmi (Nirupa Roy) and is a caring and loving husband. They have a young son, Munna (Daisy Irani).
Ashok goes on business to Bombay to meet his branch manager (Bulbul). He comes in contact with a young woman, Sangeeta (Shyama), and is soon involved in an affair with her, intending to marry her. On his return home, Lakshmi finds him changed and is shocked when he decides to sell his entire business and move to Bombay. He tells her that he's leaving and gives Lakshmi some money. Lakshmi takes her son and follows her husband to Bombay, but both get lost in the big city.
Raj, the younger brother, now called Raja, had reached Bombay making his living as a pickpocket. He stays with a street dancer Rani (Nimmi) and her father, Baba (David). Rani tries to get Raja to give up his thieving habits and is in love with him. Lakshmi and Munna accidentally meet Raja who gives them shelter. With Raja's help, Lakshmi finds Ashok, but is upset when she discovers him living with Sangeeta. Soon it's exposed that Sangeeta is the wife of Bulbul, who is a rogue and wanted to get money off Ashok. Lakshmi and Munna are reunited with a repentant Ashok. Their joy is doubled when they find that Raja is Ashok's younger brother.
