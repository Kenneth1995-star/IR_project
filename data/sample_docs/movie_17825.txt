Crush

An international architecture student at University of Western Australia and martial arts champ, Julian finds work as a house sitter for the wealthy owners of a luxury home in Perth. His new job causes friction with his girlfriend Clare, who he was supposed to live with. The house and wealth it exudes open up a realm of opportunities for Julian, and he is seduced by the mysterious and attractive Anna. Subsequently, his relationship with Clare falls apart, and he struggles to regain momentum in a martial arts championship. His academic life is threatened when his final university assignment disappears. When he speaks to the owner of the house, he mentions meeting the niece but is told that's impossible as she is away, and the name "Anna" gets a furious reaction. He asks a neighbour to shed some light on the conversation and it is revealed that a junkie died after getting into the house and falling down the stairs. He recognises Anna in the news photo. When she returns he acknowledges that she is a ghost; she turns monstrous and tries to persuade him to kill himself. His friends and girlfriend come to check on him but are too late to save him from falling down the stairs to his death, just like Anna.
