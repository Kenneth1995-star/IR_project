Fists of Legend

A moment of bad luck derailed Deok-kyu's Olympic dreams and led him and his friends to jail. Jin-ho got out of jail quickly because of his rich parents, but Deok-kyu, Jae-seok, and Sang-hoon were not so lucky.
Years later, while running a noodle shop to earn extra money following an accident involving his daughter, Deok-kyu accepts an invitation to join a televised mixed martial arts tournament, Fists of Legend. A group of middle-aged men who used to be called "legends" during their teenage high school days take part in the "real action fighting" reality show, and the winner gets a prize of ₩20 million every round, for a total of ₩200 million (US$183,823). Among the contestants are Deok-kyu's old friends Sang-hoon, currently a manager at a large company who lacks in self-respect after getting passed over for a promotion, and Jae-seok, now a good-for-nothing guy who dreams of becoming a somebody.
