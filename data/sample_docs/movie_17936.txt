 A Month of Sundays

Real estate agent Frank Mollard won't admit it, but he can't move on. Divorced but still attached, he can't sell a house in a property boom - much less connect with his teenage son. One night Frank gets a phone call from his mother. Nothing out of the ordinary. Apart from the fact that she died a year ago.
Thus blossoms a charming and unusual friendship with an elderly woman which inspires Frank to reconnect with life.
