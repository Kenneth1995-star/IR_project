Bhagirathi

Bhagirathi (Bhavana) dreams of a tank for her village and inspired by her, Maadevaraya (Kishore), the son of Mallanagowda (Srinath), convinces his father to construct one for the community. When Maadevaraya and Bhagirathi fall in love, class differences come in the way. But when they decide to end their lives, Mallanagowda is moved to solemnise their marriage on the tank's site.
As fate would have it, the tank remains dry and the priest advises Mallanagowda to sacrifice of one of his daughters-in-law. The lot falls on Bhagirathi. On learning what has happened to his young wife, Maadevaraya ends his life in the tank.
