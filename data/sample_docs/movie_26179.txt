Chota Jadugar

A group of children search for Indrajeet (Suraj Balajee) to convey the news that his father Krishna (Tirlok Malik) has returned from the United States. But Indrajeet scares them away with his magic tricks. Indrajeet lives with his grandfather, a magician Acharya (S. P. Balasubrahmanyam) in Mayapuri. The boy's mother died when he was an infant. Acharya teaches him all the magic but never sent him to school for basic education. Krishna, who runs a successful Indian channel in the US, arrives up to take away his son for education. Indrajeet refuses to leave his grandfather but is forcibly sent to New York City.
Indrajeet wakes up in another house where he finds an American woman waking him up. He meets his stepmother (Pooja Kumar) but soon he runs away from home and befriends three run-away orphans and a wonder dog who belongs to Mahesh and Lude, two funny petty thieves. Meanwhile, Acharya comes to New York in search of his grandson who gets kidnapped by the bumbling idiots and in the climax he, along with the dog, saves Indrajeet using all the 3D effects in the world.
