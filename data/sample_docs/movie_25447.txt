Jalwa

Kapil's (Naseeruddin Shah) younger brother, Buntu, dies as a result of a drug overdose. Kapil vows to put an end to drugs and drug-dealers, by joining the police. He soon attains the title of C.I.D. Inspector. He lives in Bombay with his mom (Kamini Kaushal).
One day, his friend from Goa, Albert Pinto (Pankaj Kapoor) is killed in front of him. He vows to avenge his death, but the local police will not permit him to do so. They assign this incident to another inspector. Frustrated, Kapil travels to Goa. Once there, he finds out that he has no powers as a policeman, and the Goa police regard him as a nuisance. He attempts to uncover Albert's death, with the help of Jojo (Archana Puran Singh), but instead gets into brawls, is arrested, and is escorted by the local police, back to Bombay.
Kapil escapes from police custody, and soon he is on the run, not only from the police, but local goons also, who will not hesitate to kill him.
