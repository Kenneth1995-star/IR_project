River Patrol

Two British police officers, Robby and Jean, go undercover, pretending to be husband and wife in order to smash a ring of smugglers along the Thames. During the investigation they visit the most shady places of London, including a night club with the worst imaginable reputation in the city. The fake spouses befriend and dupe the night club owner and find evidence leading to the top of the smuggler ring. However, their identities are revealed by the criminals before they can report back to their superiors, and they have to fight alone against the thugs until they finally manage to get them all arrested.[2]
