Joanna

Joanna, an art student in London, has a romantic fling with her teacher, aspiring painter Hendrik Casson. She eventually leaves him for impoverished Dominic, while her gold-digging friend Beryl takes up with the quite wealthy Lord Sanderson.
They travel to Sanderson's second home in Morocco, where he reveals that he has a terminal illness and sponsors an exhibit of Hendrik's paintings. Meanwhile, Dominic dumps Joanna because she refuses to stop seeing other men.
Joanna's next lover, Beryl's brother Gordon, impregnates her. Beaten by criminals to whom he's in debt, Gordon takes revenge by killing one. He is convicted of murder and sent to prison, leaving Joanna alone.
