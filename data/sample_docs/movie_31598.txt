Sabhash Pillaa

'Sabash Meena' is a laugh riot which shows how a simple poor girl manages to change a rich spoilt brat, making him a responsible person. Mohan (Sivaji Ganesan) is a rich spoilt brat. His erratic and irresponsible behavior forces his father Sadasivam Pillai to send him to his friend Appadorai's place in Madras to work and learn something in life. Mohan a street smart guy sends his friend Shekar (Chandrababu) in his place to Appadorai. Appadorai, who has not seen Mohan accepts Shekar as Mohan and gives him a job. Shekar falls in love with Appadorai's daughter and Mohan who meets Meena in a bus falls for her. What follow is a hilarious depiction of both their love stories and the confusions it creates.
