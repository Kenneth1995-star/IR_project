He gathers that she respects only the people who are self-employed and straightforward. He also finds out that she is unmarried and she is about to get transferred to his village soon. Back to his village, Diwakar has the plan to open a video shop with his friend Mani (Senthil). In order to secure the capital, he uses all kinds of tricks to rip off the villagers.

He then gets money from Kiruba (Goundamani), a married man who is love with Bhagyam and promises him to join them. He even claims money from chit fund which he never was a member of. After getting enough money, he opens his video shop. He starts to sell electronic products found on the street and advertises them as new products imported from Dubai.
