Kalabaaz

Trapeze artistes, Vijay (Dev Anand) and Radha (Zeenat Aman), also known as Lisa, love each other. Radha's father G.D. Sapru (Pradeep Kumar) manages the circus in which they work. In a daredevil act without any safety net support, Radha misses Vijay, falls down to ground and is hospitalized with serious wounds. Her face is totally disfigured after recovery. She decides to move abroad, not willing to show her disfigured face to Vijay. Meanwhile, a group of Hindu priests ask Vijay to locate for them statues of Shri Krishna and Devi Radha in the mountainous region bordering India and Burma. Vijay agrees to do so and sets out on the mission with Mangu (Tarun Ghosh), Changu (Asrani) and Sandoz (Hercules). On their way, they meet G. D. Sapru with his niece Tina (Zeenat Aman), Radha's look alike and also the dying Poojary (A. K. Hangal). Whether Vijay is successful in getting the statues and identifying Tina as Radha forms the rest of the story
