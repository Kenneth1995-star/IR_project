Pandava Vanavasam

The film begins Pandavas thanking Lord Krishna (Kanta Rao) after successfully performing Rajasuya Yagam for his support. On the other side Duryodhana (S. V. Ranga Rao) is humiliated and raging with anger at the insults heaped on him in the Mayasabha. Sakuni (Mudigonda Lingamurthy) consoles him and tells him that they can avenge it by inviting Dharma Raja (Gummadi) for a dice game. Dharmaraja loses everything in the dice game, including himself, his brothers and Draupadi (Savitri), who are subjected to great humiliation by Dussasana (Mikkilineni) on the orders of Duryodhana. The Pandavas are forced into exile after Dharmaraja loses again in the dice game. During their Aranyavaasam, Bheema (N. T. Rama Rao) encounters Anjaneya and brings the flower Sowgandhika Pushpam to fulfill Draupadiâ€™s wish.
To create hurdles for the Yaga being performed by the Pandavas, Duryodhana resorts to Ghosha Yatra and stays nearby. However, when he faces defeat from Gandharva king Chitrasena (Dhulipala), Dharmaraja sends Bheema and Arjuna (M. Balaiah) and rescues him. Duryodhana once again fires with insult and decides to commit suicide bur Karna (Prabhakar Reddy) and Shakuni consoles him. And makes a conspiracy to separate Lord Krishna & Pandavas by performing his son Lakshmana Kumara's (Padmanabham) marriage with Balarama's daughter Sasirekha (L. Vijayalakshmi) which boomerangs with the entry of Ghatothkacha (Satyanarayana). Finally, Sasirekha's marriage is performed with Abhimanyu (Haranath). The story ends with the successful completion of Pandavas' twelve-year exile period.
