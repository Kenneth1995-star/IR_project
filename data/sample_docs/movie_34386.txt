The film details the relationship between two neighbours, Song-Hee a chef, and Yun-Hee an anorexic writer. After her divorce, Song-Hee moves in next door to Yun-Hee. Realising she is an anorexic, Song-Hee begins to torment Yun-Hee by offering her food, eventually forcing it upon her violently.
Both women’s pasts are explored: Yun-Hee’s sexual abuse at the hands of her step-father, butcher by trade; Song-Hee’s dysfunctional marriage, her obesity, and finally the moment she cooks her husband’s dog and feeds it to him as an act of revenge.
The film ends as Yun-Hee offers her own body to be cooked and eaten. After her death and consumption, Yun-Hee is shown living happily in Song-Hee’s apartment as a spirit. The film is told in flashback, as Song-Hee is interviewed by a detective who is investigating Yun-Hee’s disappearance.
