Bujji comes across Raja Rajeshwari (Taapsee Pannu) in unexpected circumstances and falls in love with her. Raja Rajeshwari is the daughter of a powerful politician Chamundeshwari (Roja) and Shankar Rao (Naresh). The families agree to the marriage and just when everything seems nice and happy, unexpected circumstances cause a rift between them.
