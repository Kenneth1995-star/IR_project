Yeh Dillagi

Sapna (Kajol), the daughter of the Saigal family's driver, is a simple fun-loving girl, but she dreams about riches.
Vijay (Akshay Kumar) and Vicky Saigal (Saif Ali Khan) are both heirs to Saigal Industries. Vijay spends all his time working and Vicky is a flirt. Vicky notices Sapna when she becomes a successful model. But Sapna's success does not change the fact that she is a driver's daughter. Mrs. Shanti Devi, Vijay and Vicky's mother, may overlook her son's affairs with rich girls, but not with a driver's daughter. As Vijay tries to help, he finds himself falling in love with Sapna, too. Before it's too late, Sapna falls in love with him, too, and the pair decide to get married.
On Vicky's birthday, Vijay comes back with Sapna and sees his brother has changed. The man who used to be a flirt now doesn't drink liquor, smoke cigarettes, or flirt with girls. The only one he sees is Sapna. The boys talk: both want to marry Sapna. Vicky mistakenly thinks that his brother supports his pursuit of Sapna.
One afternoon, Vicky goes out for lunch with Vijay and Sapna. In the middle of their journey, they have a flat tire, and Vijay tries to fix it. Instead, the jack breaks and Vicky offers to get one from a garage. Sapna realizes that Vicky wants to marry her at that point and starts to cry, so Vijay tries to calm her down by giving her a hug. Just then, Vicky arrives and realises that there is a connection between his brother and Sapna. He returns home drunk. Their mother has had enough and tells Sapna's father to tell her to go back to Bombay or get fired.
Sapna storms off with her dad to the train station. Vicky threatens to commit suicide if his mother does not accept Sapna as her daughter-in-law; his mother accepts. Sapna returns and Vicky sacrifices his love for his brother. Vicky is seen driving and comes across a girl (Karisma Kapoor). He instantly falls for her.
