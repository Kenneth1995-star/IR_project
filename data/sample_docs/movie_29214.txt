Baghdad Thirudan

Following the betrayal of the Prime Minister, the Maharaja and the Maharani of the kingdom are murdered and their son, MGR, is hidden in a herd of cows. MGR is found by robbers hidden in the forest and eventually grows up to become their leader. The two impostors who sit on the throne have a daughter and a child servant who poses as the son who survived the death of the former royal couple. MGR, a sort of Robin Hood, robs the rich to give to the poor and strives to reconquer his kingdom.
