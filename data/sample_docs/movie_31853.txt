Padamati Sandhya Ragam

This film showcases the cultural differences of the east and the west. Adinarayana (Gummaluri Sastry) moves to Missouri, United States along with his wife and daughter Sandhya (Vijayashanti) from Andhra Pradesh to join his younger brother Ramarao. Their neighbors are Chris (Thomas Jane), a White American, and Ronald (Sivamani), an African American. Both men fall in love with Sandhya, and when both of them propose to her the same day, she accepts Chris's proposal. Knowing that her father is too traditional, eccentric, and orthodox to approve of their love, Sandhya elopes with Chris and they get married. Adinarayana doesn't have a choice but to silently witness the happenings, but when he has a granddaughter, he takes her back to India and settles there, intending to bring her up in a traditional Indian environment, and away from the foreign lure that snatched away his own daughter. As a grownup, Sandhya's daughter hates her father Chris, assuming that he was at fault and was thus disapproved by her grandfather. Chris and Sandhya visit India when Adinarayana passes away, and that is when their daughter realizes her father's humility when he performs Adinarayana's funeral in Hindu tradition, and she realizes his love towards Sandhya and Adinarayana, repenting for the ill feelings she bore all those years and returning with them to the USA.
