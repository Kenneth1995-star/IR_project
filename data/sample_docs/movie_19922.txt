Deadfall

Cat burglar Henry Clarke (Michael Caine) checks himself into a Spanish sanitarium for alcoholics under a false pretense. His true motivation is to get closer to a wealthy patient named Salinas (David Buck) and then rob his magnificent house.
Clarke is approached by Fé Moreau (Giovanna Ralli) and her much older husband, Richard (Eric Portman), to form an alliance. As a test run before the real robbery, they break into another stately home. After risking his life on a ledge, Clarke becomes so angered by Richard's failure to crack the safe that, with great effort, he drags the entire safe and its contents out of the house.
Fé and Clarke begin a romantic affair, which Richard, who has a young male lover, does not discourage. Fé buys a new Jaguar convertible for Clarke and tells him the safe contained jewels worth at least a half-a-million dollars.
Before the time comes to rob Salinas's mansion, Fé travels to Tangier without letting Clarke know she was leaving. Richard then tells Clarke a harrowing tale of how he once betrayed his male lover to the Nazis and later impregnated the man's wife. Their baby was Fé, but choosing not to tell her that she was his daughter, Richard married her.
A contemptuous Clarke decides to break into Salinas' mansion on his own. Fé returns and is shocked when a suicidal and depressed Richard reveals the truth about their relationship. She races to the Salinas mansion and inadvertently alerts a guard, who shoots Clarke coming out a window. He falls to his death.
Fé attends a funeral. Afterwards, she is led off by police, while Richard's gay lover drives off in Clarke's car.
