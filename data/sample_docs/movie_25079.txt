Jaani Dushman

Jwala Prasad is to marry the girl of his dreams. On the day of the marriage, his wife is dressed all in red, mixes poison in the milk, (the saga does not end here) and Jwala becomes a monster, and continues to terrorize the region, first abducting brides dressed in red and killing them. When a groom confronts and kills the monster, it leaves the body of Jwala Prasad and possesses the body of his killer. And the terror continues. Years later, another man has now killed this creature, and the monster has possessed the man's body, and it is again on a killing spree. The suspense mounts as one by one the brides are killed off and no one seems to have a clue. Everybody seems to be suspect, including the village Priest, the Thakur, his son, and several other people.The suspense is unraveled in the end and the monster is made to promise that he will no longer possess any person and will not carry on with his killing spree. The movie was a box office hit of 1979 and all of the songs of this film became hits. It is a horror story.
