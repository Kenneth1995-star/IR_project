Kandhan Karunai

The film revolves around Lord Murugan, his birth, marriage and his acceptance of the post of the head of the army of heaven. In Hinduism, there are six abodes of lord Muruga, known as the "Arupadaiveedu". The story behind each of the abodes are portrayed choronologically in the film. It starts with Swamimalai, where Lord Muruga (Master Sridhar) teaches the meaning of the word 'OM' to his father, Lord Shiva (Gemini Ganesan). He goes to Palani Hills after a fight over a sacred fruit, that is his second abode. Then he wins over the demon king Surapadman in Thiruchendur and that is his third abode. The King of heaven, Lord Indra offers his Daughter's hand in appreciation of Lord Muruga's Victory and he marries her in Thirupparamkunram, his fourth abode. He later marries Valli in his fifth abode of Thiruthani, later after a short dispute between both his wives they amicably settle in Pazhamudircholai, his sixth abode. All the events are summarised by Nakkeerar, a great Tamil Poet portrayed by Sirkazhi Govindarajan at the end of the film.
