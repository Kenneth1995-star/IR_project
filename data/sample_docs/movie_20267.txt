House of Mortal Sin

Troubled young Jenny (Susan Penhaligon) enters the confessional of her local church, and bares her soul to elderly priest Father Meldrum (Anthony Sharp). Apparently obsessed with her, Meldrum begins to stalk the distressed Jenny and blackmail her with a tape recording of her confession. Seeing himself as the dispenser of "divine justice", Meldrum tortures his victims with guilt, murdering those in his way with such diverse means as incense burners and poisoned holy wafers.
