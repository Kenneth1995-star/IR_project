All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception and the Spirit of I. F. Stone

All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone described Independent journalist I. F. Stone (1907â€“89) pioneered the practice of investigative journalism, digging into public records and back-page stories to track down information. We see the challenges these reporters face as they try to go beneath the surface. Frey documents the cover-up of undocumented burials of people killed while crossing the U.S./Mexico border. Bonus features include extended interviews. The film looks at independent journalists' investigations of governments dating back to the 1960s and manages to retain a nonpartisan point of view.[2]
