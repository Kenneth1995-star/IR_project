Kanoon a.k.a. The Law

Ashok and Usha are friends in college who fall in love with each other. They have a common issue which unites them; the social evil of young girls forcibly married off to older men. Ashok has strong reasons as he is ashamed of his father who is married a girl younger than Ashok. Lala Dinanath, Usha's father is heavily in debt to Seth Hirachand. Hirachand's son, Ramesh, who studies in college with Usha has fallen in love with her. He does not know that his father intends marrying Usha in lieu of the debt her father owes Hirachand. His attraction for Usha causes a source of anguish for Hansa, the family Munim's (accountant) daughter, and hence are in service to Hirachand. Hansa and Ramesh have been childhood friends with a vague understanding of marriage between them.
When Dinanath is told by Hirachand that he would like to welcome Usha in his house, it is misunderstood as an offer of marriage for Ramesh. Dinanath agrees initially, but refuses when Hirachand lets him know his intentions of marrying Usha. Ramesh does not know about his father's proposal to Dinanath, as his father has sent him off on a family business with the Munim. Usha agrees to marry Hirachand when he threatens to take Dinanath to court over the borrowed money. A drama staged by Ashok and Usha in college forms the final part of the story. The stage play called "Kanoon" (Law) is about the social injustices against women, which force a woman to take her life. The play is watched by Hirachand who starts becoming uncomfortable as the play unfolds and rushes home, just as the protagonist in the stage play puts a gun to her head. He reaches home and dies following a heart attack.
