Mouth to Mouth

Mouth to Mouth follows the lives of four young people, trying to improve their lives in a harsh and unforgiving city.
One night, after a fight with other inmates in a juvenile detention centre, Carrie and Jeanie escape and hide from the police in a derelict factory. Finding work in a roadside cafe, they meet Tim and Serge, two young country guys who have come to the city looking for work. After an eventful first night together, the girls invite the two boys to stay on with them in the old factory.
While Serge and Tim look for a job, the girls supplement the boy’s dole cheques through petty theft from shops and supermarkets. Over time, the four become increasingly close, and manage to make a communal home together in the derelict factory. Carrie’s ambitions for a better future place increasing strains on their friendship.
