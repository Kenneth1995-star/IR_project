Fighting Youth

A radical campus group persuades student Carol Arlington to lead a protest of a college's football team. She manages to recruit Larry Davis, even though he is a star player for State's team.
Larry needs money to marry sweetheart Betty Wilson, but needs a job. Carol and the committee protest that the school is using its athletes to make a profit. A distracted Larry fumbles in the next game and is kicked off the team by Coach Parker, who is offended by Larry's campus activities.
With some asserting that Larry lost the game on purpose, a campus radical, Tony Tonetti, turns out to be an undercover agent investigating troublemakers trying to infiltrate the campus and influence the students. Larry is left out of the big season-ending game until the very end, when Parker has a change of heart, lets him play and ends up victorious.
