Breakfast with Scot

Eric McNally (Tom Cavanagh) is a gay retired hockey player turned television sportscaster who lives with his partner Sam (Ben Shenkman), a sports lawyer. When Sam unexpectedly becomes the legal guardian of his brother's stepson, Scot (Noah Bernett), their lives are turned upside down as the demands of being a parent — as well as the boy's preference for clothing and hobbies which suggest that he may also be gay — begin to intrude on Eric's desire to remain closeted at work. Eric's unwillingness to accept the situation eventually fades as Scot teaches Eric about loving your true self.
