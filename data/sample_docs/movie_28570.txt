King Liar

Sathyanarayan (Dileep) is a compulsive liar, who lies to his love interest Anjali that he is the managing director of a big firm, while instead he makes duplicate certificates with his roommate and friend Antappan. Into their lives comes Anand Varma (Lal), a Dubai- based rich fashion tycoon, who is on the verge of divorce with his wife Devika Varma (Asha Sarath). Meanwhile, Sathyanarayan realizes that Anjali is his childhood friend.
Anand does not want to lose Devika, so he hires Sathyanarayan to persuade Devika to step back from the divorce. Sathyan and Antappan fly to Dubai to join the company which is now owned by Devika. The first time, Devika kicks Sathyan out of the company, but later had to let him join. Amazed by Sathyan's business tricks, Devika later promotes him as the Assistant Manager.
As Devika was planning to appoint someone representing Devika in the Asian Beauty Contest, Sathyan persuades Anand to pick Anjali as his model. Devika finally finds Natasha as her representative, but Sathyan persuades Natasha to reunite Anand and Devika. In the end, Anjali wins the competition after explaining the consequences of being divorced in the Intelligence round, and Anand and Devika reunite. Anjali, after the competition, visits Sathyan who says his real name is Naran to Anjali. Sathyan confesses that Anjali is his childhood friend, and they both reunite.
