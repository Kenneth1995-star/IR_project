Roads to Koktebel

A Boy with his Father go to the sea. They come in a freight car in the trucker's cabin. They go from house to house, by forest, by field. In Moscow they have nothing left. And there, by the sea is hope of a new happy life beginning. For the Father, the road is an attempt to regain faith in himself, and the friendship and trust of his son. The Boy's target objective is the Koktebel village, where in the hills near the sea a wind is constantly blowing, where the albatross soars.
