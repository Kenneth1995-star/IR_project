Prabhuvinte Makkal (പ്രഭുവിന്റെ മക്കൾ)

The film centres around a septuagenarian industrialist called Dayadananda Prabhu (Madhu). He has two sons, Mani (Jijoy)and Siddhartha (Vinay Fort). Mani is a confirmed atheist. But Siddhartha, in spite of being a physics student, and completing post-graduation in it with high rank, is more into spiritualism and oriental occult. Prabhu wants Siddhartha to marry Devika (Swaasika) his classmate, and join the same college as lecturer. But by this time, Sidhartha is hopelessly enamored by spiritualism and the works of Fritjof Kapra, the Austrian born American physicist. He suddenly leaves home to Hrishikesh, the sacred place of Hindus; he is in search of a guru who can teach him Ashtasiddhi (The eight divine yogic powers).
Siddhartha spends almost seven years in Hrishikesh and comes across many divine men and gurus there. At the end of his spiritual wanderings, he achieves ‘realisation’ – of the dark and diabolic side of spiritual industry, and returns home as a totally changed man. Coming back to his village after eleven years, Siddhartha is overwhelmed at the sight of religious revival in his society. Even Prabhu who was once an irreligious man has become the devotee of a god man (Prakash Bare). He is also pleasantly surprised to know that Devika still remains unmarried as she could never forget him.
Prabhu is about to hand over 60 acres of his land to the god man to build a super specialty hospital. Siddhartha is very upset with the developments. Before transferring the assets Prabhu dies in a car accident in mysterious circumstances. For the first time in his life, Siddhartha is forced into action. With the staunch support and help of his brother Mani, and Devika, Sidhartha unravels the dark truth behind his father's death. In this effort, he is supported by the timely and honest efforts of Adithya (Kalabhavan Mani), the Deputy Superintendent of Police.
