Born to Sing

The TV program National Singing Contest is set to film in the city of Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province. Because the contest is well known as a ticket to becoming a star singer, a number of locals scramble to appear in the televised show.
Among the applicants is Bong-nam (Kim In-kwon), a financially inept, socially awkward man who works as an assistant at his wife's hair salon during the day and as a personal driver for intoxicated businessmen at night. But Bong-nam's lifelong dream has always been to sing. When he hears the news that the country's most popular singing contest will be held in his hometown, he takes part in the preliminary auditions without telling his wife Mi-ae (Ryu Hyun-kyung). But soon, his stunning performance makes him the talk of the town, and he becomes an overnight star among the middle-aged women in the city.[7]
Hyun-ja (Lee Cho-hee) is Mi-ae's younger sister. She works for a local health drink company, and has a crush on Dong-soo, a guy in the PR department (Yoo Yeon-seok). The company CEO orders Hyun-ja to enter the singing contest in order to promote their drink, which she does with Dong-soo's help.
Mayor Joo Ha-na (Kim Soo-mi) is running for reelection and thinks an appearance in the contest will boost her bid. Unfortunately, she is tone-deaf and a terrible singer. Maeng (Oh Kwang-rok), the section chief at city hall, is in charge of helping the production while they film in Gimhae, and he gets pressured by the mayor to find a way of getting her in.
Bo-ri (Kim Hwan-hee) lives with her grandfather (Oh Hyun-gyung). She helps him prepare for his audition, though he keeps forgetting the lyrics. But Bo-ri's mother arrives and wants to immigrate to Canada. So her grandfather is determined to join the contest to leave a lasting memory for his granddaughter.[8]
