The Hundredth Chance

As summarized in a film publication,[3] Jack Bolton (Seaward) is the genius of the racing stable of Lord Saltash. He falls in love with Maud Brian (Glynne), daughter of Lady Bernard Brian (Lascelles), who is married to the innkeeper Giles Sheppard (Arundell). While Maud knows Jack is in love with her, she is half in love with Lord Saltash (Neilson-Terry) and does not love Jack. However, Lord Saltash's cruelty to her crippled brother Bunny (Key) makes her hesitate. She contemplates marrying Jack to protect her brother. Jack then takes the "hundredth chance" and asks Maud to marry him, hoping her love will come later. After Maud marries Jack, Lord Saltash desires his trainer's new wife and traps her in his castle and tries to compromise her. That same day Saltash's horse named The Hundredth Chance wins a big race and Jack wins a fortune. That day Jack also wins his wife's love after his trust in her despite the apparently damning circumstances created by Lord Saltash. Maud, who had been wife in name only, becomes Jim's wife in fact.
