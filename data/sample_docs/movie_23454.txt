Troublesome Night 6

Four years ago, four paparazzi were stalking Kwok Siu-Heung, a model who was dating a rich tycoon. After Kwok fell to her death from a rooftop and landed right in front of them, they meddled with her dead body and snapped photos from various angles before fleeing the scene. The photos made it to the cover story of the magazine.
In the present day, Chak, a police inspector, and his colleagues are investigating the death of one of the paparazzi who has been found dead inside a lift. Chak also experiences visions of Kwok's ghost, wearing a red dress and holding a red umbrella; he thinks that she is trying to communicate something to him. As Chak and his team uncover more clues pointing to Kwok's suicide, the other three paparazzi die under mysterious circumstances in similar ways as the first one.
While he is drunk, Chak enters a dreamy state and suddenly recalls that he met Kwok on the night she died. They were making out on the rooftop when she dared him to follow suit if she jumped off. Thinking it was a joke, Chak agreed and told her that he will be next if she died. To his horror, she then plunged to her death in front of him. He immediately rushed down and tried to call for help but got knocked down by a car. After recovering from a coma, he could not remember what happened that night â€“ until now. Kwok's ghost appears to Chak and reminds him of what he promised her.
