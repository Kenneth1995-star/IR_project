College Girl

Madhuri, Vicky and Akash study together in college. Akash, whose father is a minister, tries to woo her, but she falls for Akash. Vicky introduces her to drugs through another girl. She becomes an addict. Akash contests against Vicky in the student elections and wins. Furious, Vicky rapes Madhuri. Her brother blames her and is reluctant to file a police complaint. Her sister-in-law, however, decides to go to the police when Akash assures that he will stand by Madhuri. The police inspector tips off the minister before registering the case. The minister tries to persuade her not to go ahead with the complaint, but when she rebuffs him, he threatens to go on to rape her too and get both her and her husband killed. The court too absolves Vicky of the charge. Madhuri, with the help of Akash, takes revenge by taking on Vicky, the minister and their accomplices, one by one.[1][2]
