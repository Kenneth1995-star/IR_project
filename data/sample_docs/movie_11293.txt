Small Sacrifices

On 19 May 1983 at approximately 10:48 p.m, Diane Downs, drove to McKenzie-Willamette Hospital in Springfield, Oregon with a gunshot wound to her arm. She claimed that an unknown assailant attempted to carjack her and shot her three children: Karen, 8,?Shauna, 7, and Robby, 3. Shauna was dead on arrival at the hospital. Eldest daughter Karen was badly injured, but survived suffering a temporary loss of speech due to a stroke after the shooting, but recovered sufficiently to serve as a witness in court against her mother. Diane's son was paralyzed from the chest down. Downs was diagnosed with three cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, histrionic and narcissistic. She was eventually tried and convicted of murder, attempted murder, and assault. During the court scene the prosecution plays Duran Duran's Hungry Like the Wolf to demonstrate to the jury Diane's choice of song used to motivate her to kill.
The film shows that Downs started a romance with a married man, Lew Lewiston, the man who did not want children. Downs planned to kill her children to be free to pursue this relationship. He ended the relationship and remained with his wife.
Diane Downs is sentenced to life in prison, and her two surviving children are adopted by the prosecutor Frank Joziak and his wife, Lola.
