Prisoners in Petticoats

Mark Hampton from the district attorney's office investigates a shooting outside the nightclub of gangster Nicky Bowman, questioning club pianist Beverly Brent as well. Beverly's real name is Joan Grey but she uses a pseudonym so that the reputation of her father, a college professor, won't be sullied by her association with criminals, including boyfriend Steve London.
A gun moll, Francie White, double-crosses boyfriend Sam Clarke, who is killed while Steve makes off with $100,000 of Sam's from an armored-car heist. When bags are switched, Beverly is unaware that she now has the stolen money. When it is found at the professor's home, Steve is shot by police and Beverly is placed under arrest and sent to prison.
Francie is behind bars for another crime. She persuades Beverly to break out, then betrays her, tipping off Bowman. In the nick of time, Hampton comes to the rescue, having developed a romantic interest in Beverly.
