There are terrorist attacks all over the world. Planes, trains, houses are blown to kingdom come by unknown rockets! The one to call is India's super agent Bond 303! When we first meet him he's occupied with a dozen ladies and they all burst out in an intensive song-and-dance number! Bond 303 befriends a young smart scientist, played by the cool Parveen Babi and they start to gather information about the evil organization behind it all. But someone wants to stop them and sooner than you can say "curry" they are in grave danger!
