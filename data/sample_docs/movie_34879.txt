Mandıra Filozofu

Cavit an ambitious industralist in İstanbul plans to buy a beautiful sea side land in Muğla Province to build a boutique hotel.[2] His wife further plans to change the natural scenery by demolishing a hill. The land belongs to the members of a village family. Most of the family members readily accept his offer. Among them Şükrü is the most enthusiastic for he needs money to marry. But Mustafaali, another owner, quite unlike his relatives, opposes selling the land. He is a philosopher and living far from the modern life amenities in his small and primitive cottage just like a Robinson Crusoe. He says he doesn't need money and he is happy in his wildlife environment. Cavit tries to persuade him. But in the end Mustafaali persuades Cavit to give up modern life. Cavit moves to a cottage of his own and begins to lead a life far from the stress of business and big city. Nevertheless, he financially helps Şükrü to marry.
