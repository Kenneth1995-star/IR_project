Solo for Sparrow

Inspector Sparrow (Glyn Houston) is a provincial detective who sets up his own private-eye firm when Scotland Yard meddles with his business. When crooks accidentally kill a shop cashier while stealing the keys to the jewellery shop where she works, Sparrow goes to work. He successfully tracks down the criminals and turns them over to Scotland Yard.
