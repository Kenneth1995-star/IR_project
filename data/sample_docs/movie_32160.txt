Sambaram

Ravi (Nitin) and Geeta (Nikitha) are childhood friends. Ravi is a carefree guy who roams around with friends without concentrating on studies. Geeta is a sincere student who passes engineering studies. Ravi has feelings for her and everybody in the town is aware of it except for Geeta. When she is asked by Nitin's sister-in-law Seeta when she is planning to marry Ravi, she expresses her surprise and says that they are just friends and she has no feelings for him. She shows her materialistic attitude by saying that she wants her husband to be financially and academically stronger than her. Ravi is devastated after listening to her logic. He realizes the importance of being a responsible family member and work as a mechanic to earn money. He becomes proficient in his work and finally gets the visa to work in Dubai. He wants to leave for Dubai as it gives him an opportunity to prove his money-earning ability despite being away from Geeta. Meanwhile, Geeta's father dies and she starts realizing that it takes more than academics and finances to make a man qualified to be a husband. And by that time Ravi is already at the airport. Would Geeta express her love to Ravi before he leaves for Dubai?
