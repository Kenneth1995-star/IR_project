Hi Gang!

Two married reporters (Daniels and Lyon) in New York City working for rival radio networks engage in cut-throat competition, assisted by an incompetent with big ideas (Oliver). A publicity stunt by the couple to adopt a British evacuee boy live on air goes wrong and they end up adopting Albert (Moffatt) a rowdy pub landlord's son and his cantankerous Uncle Jerry (Marriott). The final third of the film sees them all travel to England in the mistaken belief that Albert is the son of Lord Amersham.
