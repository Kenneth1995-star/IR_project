Vijay, Simran

Udhayakumaran aka Udhaya(Vijay) is a college student who does research on sub-atomic physics. He is offered a research position at Cambridge University due to his ground-breaking research papers. However, he declines the offer and becomes a Lecturer in his college,where he meets Vasanthi (Simran) and soon they fall in love with each other. Udhaya later comes to know that she has already been engaged, and decides to move to another city. With the help of Basheer (Vivek) he finds a job as a Reporter in Chennai.
Unfortunately, Basheer dies in a bomb blast and Udhaya unwittingly gets to meet the people responsible for Basheer's death, who then introduce him to their boss Dhananjay Veeran(Nassar),who poses as a crusader, with veiled intentions. Udhaya sympathises with the crusaders and helps build an instrument to break granite slabs, aiding manual labourers. Later, he builds a bomb born out of his research and gives it to Veeran to help their cause in supporting labourers. However, Veeran uses the bomb on a train without Udhaya's knowledge, killing many innocent people and framing Udhaya for the bomb blast, who is further arrested for a crime he did not commit.
En route from the court, the police vehicle is caught in a puddle and Udhaya seizes his chance and escapes. On the run, he stumbles upon Veeran and his accomplice discussing a plot to bomb a school bus and comes to the realisation that Veeran is the culprit. Udhaya manages to save the school kids from the explosion. Veeran arrives and attempts to shoot Udhaya. A fight ensues, in which Veeran is thrown into the flames of the wreckage. Udhaya is arrested and tried in court, where he pleads not guilty and is released, embracing Vasanthi as the credits roll.
