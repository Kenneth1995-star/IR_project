Madonna

Due to her mounting bills, Moon Hye-rim becomes a nurse's aide and is assigned to the VIP ward to take care of a patient who has been left paralyzed by a stroke, Kim Cheol-oh. Kim is a billionaire tycoon and the hospital's major investor, and for ten years his unscrupulous son Sang-woo has done everything in his power to extend his father's life through a series of organ transplants because Kim had instructed in his will that his entire fortune is to be given to charities (thereby putting an end to Sang-woo's affluent lifestyle). One day, a brain-dead, pregnant young woman named Jang Mi-na is brought to the hospital after a mysterious car crash. In exchange for a sum of money, Hye-rim agrees to Sang-woo's instructions that she track down Mi-na's next-of-kin and get them to sign an organ donation consent form for her heart. As Hye-rim delves into Mi-na's past and discovers that Mi-na was bullied since childhood for her hair color, weight and poverty, to her adulthood as a sexually abused factory worker who becomes a prostitute named "Madonna," the more Hye-rim forms a strange bond with her comatose patient and becomes determined to derail the heart transplant.
