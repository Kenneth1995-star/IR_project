All About My Wife

After seven years of marriage, the mild-mannered Doo-hyun (Lee Sun-kyun) is at the end of his rope, Jung-in (Im Soo-jung), his wife is driving him crazy with her endless nagging and complaining. He can’t even bring himself to ask for a divorce because of the fights that will follow. When Doo-hyun’s company transfers him out of state, it seems like his dream of getting away is coming true. But to his horror, Jung-in surprises him by moving across the country to be with him. Desperate but too afraid to ask for a divorce, Doo-hyun recruits his next-door neighbor and legendary Casanova Sung-ki (Ryu Seung-ryong) to seduce his wife and make her leave him first. After scoping her out, Sung-ki is intrigued by the challenge and confidently agrees to seduce Jung-in as his career finale. Meanwhile, to give her something to do, Doo-hyun has already arranged for Jung-in to get a spot on the local radio station, shooting her mouth off about life's injustices. True to his reputation, Sung-ki eventually succeeds in grabbing Jung-in’s attention, and the two slowly develop feelings for each other. But though Doo-hyun asked for it, he grows to regret his decision and decides to spy on his wife and her lover.[7][8][9]
