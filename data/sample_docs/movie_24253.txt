Sudhir (Motilal), a young millionaire is leading a dissipated life indulging in drinks, gambling and women due to sheer boredom. His health starts fading and after one such bout he faints. The doctor admonishes him regarding his life-style. He advises him against his fast life and suggests that he take to some physical labour, which the doctor is sure Sudhir will not be able to do. Sudhir takes up the challenge and decides to give up his home for three hundred days and live without using his wealth. He sets out into the world with nothing in his pocket. The challenges he faces and how he overcomes them are interspersed with a lot of humour and hard work as he tries to make a living.

When the boss faces problems with the factory, Sudhir anonymously sends money to help him out. Eventually the three hundred days are over, Sudhir now a healthy young man has won his bet with the doctor and a wife for himself.
