Meera Madhava Raghava

Meera (Ramya) a singer and Madhava (Diganth) a lecturer get married. Meera sacrifices her dream of becoming a big singer to support her husband who dreams to be an IAS officer. She is forced to borrow money from a rowdy Raghava (Tilak), who wanted to marry her. Meera forges her husband's signature to get money from Raghava. Time flies by and Madhava becomes a sincere IAS officer targeting corrupt elements of the society. This brings him in direct conflict with Raghava, who wants to contest elections. It is payback time for Meera with consequences being too harsh for her to handle. How she faces everything and becomes a winner forms the rest of the story.
