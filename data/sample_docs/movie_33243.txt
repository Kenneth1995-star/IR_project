Ohranger vs. Kakuranger

In the year 1999, the Machine Empire of Baranoia, led by Emperor Bacchushund, invades Earth with the intention of wiping out all human life and bringing about machine rule. Chief Counsellor Miura revives super energies that had been born of the lost civilization of Pangaea. Assembling pieces of a stone plate uncovered three years previously, he reveals the secrets of "Super Power". Enlisting an elite five-man team of the United Airforce's finest pilots, Miura builds a pyramid to generate Tetrahedron power in order to allow five UAOH officers to transform into the Ohrangers and stop Baranoia's invasion.
