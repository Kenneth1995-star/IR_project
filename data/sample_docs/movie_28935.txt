Bharthruhari

King Bharthruhari (Serkulathur Sama) is married to 300 wives. He spends most of his time with the youngest of them and his most favourite, Pingala (B. Jayamma). The chief groom of the king's horses, Aswapaalan (N. S. Krishnan) resorts to thievery to satisfy the needs of his mistress, Sundari (T. A. Madhuram). The people who were robbed complain to the king, who decides to find the culprit and punish him. Through sheer happenstance, Aswapaalan meets Pingala and both start having an affair without the king's knowledge. Vikramadityan (G. Pattu Iyer), the king's brother, catches Aswapaalan one night and puts him in custody in Pingala's palace. To escape from the situation lest her affair with Aswapaalan is discovered, complains to Bharthruhari that Vikramadityan tried to seduce her, which Vikramadityan denies. The king immediately banishes Vikramadityan without looking into the matter properly. Later, the king realises that his younger brother was telling the truth when he sees Aswapaalan and Pingala together. Shocked and aggrieved, he gives up his throne, brings Vikramadityan back and crowns him as the new king. Bharthruhari then becomes a hermit and retires to the forest to do penance.[1]
