Don't Lose Your Head

It is the time of the French Revolution, and two bored English noblemen, Sir Rodney Ffing (pronounced "Effing") and his best friend Lord Darcy Pue (played by Sid James and Jim Dale respectively), decide to have some fun and save their French counterparts from beheading by the guillotine.
Enraged revolutionary leader Citizen Camembert (Kenneth Williams) and his toadying lackey, Citizen Bidet (Peter Butterworth), scour France and England for the elusive saviour of the French nobles, who has become known as The Black Fingernail. After abducting the Fingernail's true love, Jacqueline (Dany Robin), Camembert and Bidet plot to lure the Fingernail to his death... oblivious that Desiree (Joan Sims), Camembert's flamboyant sister, is herself in love with the hero and will do all she can to save him from the guillotine.
