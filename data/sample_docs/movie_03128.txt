Moonlight in Hawaii

Deciding to quit his singing act and become a tourist guide, Pete Fleming escorts wealthy Mrs. Floto and her three nieces to Hawaii for a vacation. Behind his back, Pete's three bandmates stowaway and tag along.
At a resort, bandleader Clipper Conovan can't hire the musicians, but hotel guest Toby Spencer, taking a shine to Pete, introduces him to her father Walter, who runs a pineapple plantation. Walter is involved in a business dispute with his partner, Lawton, and both men vie for Mrs. Floto's attentions as well.
Toby falls for Pete, who discovers she can sing and wants her to be a part of the band's new act. But one of Mrs. Floto's nieces also wants to sing, and exotic entertainer Ilani catches everyone's eye, too. Toby and Pete ultimately form a partnership, professionally and romantically, while Mrs. Floto, unable to decide between the two pineapple growers, surprises both by deciding to marry Clipper the bandleader.
