The story is about a college lecturer Premachandran (Jayaram), who faces troubles when his wife Sulochana (Gautami) develops an inferiority complex about their family life, after seeing their happily married neighbours Rajeevan and Radhika (Siddique and Vaishnavi). Rajeevan is a medical representative and working for a pharmaceutical company. Rajeevan's personality, confidence and his charishma impresses Sulochana and she wishes her husband was like Rajeevan. Sulochana keeps on comparing Rajeevan with her husband to such an extent that it makes Premachandran jealous. Premachandran tries to mend his behaviour and tries his best to express his love for Sulochana but fails in his attempts.
The climax reveals Rajeevan to be a fraudster who has an extra marital relationship with one of their neighbours and everything adorable about his family life was a cover-up. Sulochana realizes her husband's sincere love towards her.
The story gives a moral of true love which comes from the depth of one's heart and does not necessarily "show off".
