Laddie

Farmer son Laddie Stanton falls in love with the daughter of the man who just bought the land next door, Pamela Pryor. Her father is a vicious old Englishman, and isn't at all happy with the prospect of having Laddie as a son-in-law.
Pamela tries to make Laddie get another profession, to please her father and be able to continue their relation. Laddie is very upset and regards Pamela's plead as disrespectful. Laddie's sister, Sister, decides to help the. couple out.
Later, Mr. Pryor's dishonored son Robert, arrives on a visit. The Stanton family takes him in when his father doesn't, and Sister starts scheming how to use this to their advantage. When she tells Mr. Pryor that his son is staying with them, the old man is furious and goes to visit the family. He learns that Robert is ill and therefore was discharged from the British Army. Understanding that he was wrong about his son, Mr. Pryor forgives him and also warms to Laddie.
Pamela then apologizes to Laddie for trying to change him and they are reconciled.[4]
