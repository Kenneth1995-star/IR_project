For Them That Trespass

Promising writer Christopher Drew conceals his relationship with a murdered woman in order to protect his career, even though this results in an innocent man going to prison for the killing.
The upper-class Drew decides he needs some first-hand experience to invigorate his work, so he explores the seedier areas of town in search of inspiration. Much to his dismay, he witnesses a murder but refuses to help an innocent man, Herbert Logan, arrested for the crime, because his presence in such a neighbourhood would cause a scandal. Logan is freed after serving 15 years in jail and he hears his "crime" detailed on a radio drama written by Drew, which enables him to gather enough evidence to finally clear his name.[4]
