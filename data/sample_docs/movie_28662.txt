Paipin Chuvattile Pranayam

Paippin Chuvattile Pranayam traces the story of a young Govindankutty (Neeraj Madhav) and his friends, who are the local payans of Pandarathuruth island. As the movie starts, one can see that it takes a dip into the rustic beauty of the village and the surreal experience of lake water fishing.
