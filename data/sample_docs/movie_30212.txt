Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga

Murali is the college boy cum singer (with bundles of commitments belonging to the lower middle class) who enchants the rich college girl Kausalya (new face - with girl next door looks) with his musical skills. Kausalya the music buff who is in the habit of appreciating good singers over the phone, does it with Murali also. The telephonic voice of Kausalya turns out to have a tremendously magical romantic effect upon the hero, who besides falling in love head over heel, with her wants to see her.
