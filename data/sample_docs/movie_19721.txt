East of Sudan

In late 1884, during the height of the Mahdist insurrection in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the Mahdist forces attack Barash, a British outpost 200 miles upriver from Khartoum.
Four people escape from the attack in a riverboat: Private Richard Baker, a soldier in the British army; Murchison, an inexperienced subaltern in the army; Asua, the daughter of the local Emir; and Asua's British governess, Margret Woodville.
Over the course of the journey, the group find themselves in perilous dangers on the Nile and its banks. Facing off against nature, Arab slavers and a beleaguered Negro tribe the slavers prey on, they are saved by King Gondoko's missionary-raised brother Kimrasi, who then joins them.
Soldiers Murchison and Baker frequently clash, while Baker and Margaret fall in love.
Once in Khartoum, they find the revolt has reached it and the men join the fight...
