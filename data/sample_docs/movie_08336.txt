A Lovely Way to Die

After quitting his job as a police detective, Jim Schuyler accepts an offer from lawyer Tennessee Fredericks to protect Rena Westabrook, who's about to go on trial for the murder of her wealthy husband.
Rena is accused of conspiring with a lover, Jonathan Fleming, to kill Westabrook for his money. She has an alibi from Sean Magruder, who says he witnessed her in a bar at the time of the murder, but Schuyler ends up finding Magruder dead in a car.
A gang responsible for the death of a British man named Finchley appears to be behind Westabrook's and Magruder's murders as well. Rena is the next target after being acquitted in court, but Schuyler heroically saves her life.
