Dharma

Dharma (Vijayakanth) lives with his lawyer father (Jaishankar), his mother (Vadivukkarasi), his journalist brother Vijay (Thalaivasal Vijay) and beloved sister Geetha (Shilpa). Dharma and Sharmila (Preetha Vijayakumar) fall in love with each other. Dharma is an angry man who cannot tolerate injustice. One day, his sister is molested by a rowdy Raja and Dharma kills him in public. Thus, he is sent in jail. In the meantine, Ranjith (Ranjith), Dharma's friend, becomes an ACP.
On his return, Dharma becomes a powerful gangster who punishes the rowdies in his own way and helps the poor. The honest chief minister (S. S. Rajendran) gives free hand to arrest all the goons including Dharma. Dharma's sister, Geetha, gets married with Ranjith.
Daas (Mansoor Ali Khan), a drug smuggler, Khan (Ponnambalam), a killer, and Amarnath (Kazan Khan), a land grabber, work under a corrupted politician Chakravarthy (Vinu Chakravarthy). They decide to kill the current Chief Minister but Vijay has listened their plan and immediately informs Ranjith. Surprisingly, Ranjith kills Vijay by behind. In fact, Ranjith is Raja's brother (the man who was killed by Dharma) and wants to take revenge on Dharma.
Later, the Chief Minister is severely injured by the rowdies but Dharma saves him and hides him in a secured place. In the meanwhile, Geetha finds out that her brother Vijay was killed by her husband Ranjith and Ranjith also kills her.
The police department seeks Dharma for kidnapping the Chief Minister. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
