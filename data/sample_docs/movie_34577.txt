Juvenile Offender

Jang Ji-Goo is a 16-year-old juvenile offender under probation who lives with his only known relative - his grandfather who is sick in bed all the time with severe diabetic complications. To Ji-Goo, home is only a place that stinks with sickness and school, a place to hang out. His only interest in life is his sweet new girlfriend, Kim Sae-Rom. One day, he gets caught after committing burglary with the neighborhood big boys. And without a parent to plead for him, the judge sentences Ji-Goo to the juvenile reformatory while others get lighter penalties.
Eleven months later, Ji-Goo is informed that his grandfather has died. After the funeral, his teacher tracks down Ji-Gooâ€™s mom, who he thought was dead but in fact had run away from home after giving birth to him at age 17. Ji-Goo is simply shocked to realize that he has a mother. But after he gets discharged from the juvenile reformatory, he and his young mother try to make up for their time lost. Ji-Goo starts off living together with his mother with high expectations, but he soon realizes that his mother is much too young just like himself and he comes to understand why she had to leave him right after giving birth. But when Ji-Goo falls into a similar situation with his girlfriend, his mother who he thought would understand is appalled at the news which creates a conflict between the two.[12]
