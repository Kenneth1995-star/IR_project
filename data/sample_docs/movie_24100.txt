Chupkatha

The film is about an extra-marital affair involving a married man and a medical student. Sambit (Silajit Majumder) and his wife (Aparajita Auddy) are in love but they could never express their love for each other. Anwesha (Payel Roy) is a young medical student who happens to be as lonely as Sambit. Both of them required someone to share their emotions with. As a result, they start finding themselves comfortable with each other. Sambit helps Anwesha while she is still a student and in return, she gives him company. They experience an unspoken closeness towards each other and fall into a complicated relationship. Because the relationship has no future, neither of them could express their feelings, even as they love and share a mutual respect towards each other. Sambit later has a heart attack and Anwesha performs the operation for free since she considered she owed Sambit this. In the end, they part just as they meet, and things remain the way they were earlier.[3]
