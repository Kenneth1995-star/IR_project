Balidaan

Inspector Vijay (Jeetendra) lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay along with his aunt while his father, retired Major Prem Kishan (Shammi Kapoor) lives in the countryside in a farmhouse. Vijay meets and falls in love with Uma (Sridevi), who lives opposite his house along with her father, Jag Mohan (Pinchoo Kapoor) and her mother Janki (Shubha Khote). When Jag Mohan finds out that Uma and Vijay are in love, he forbids her to see him, but subsequently relents when she takes poison. Both Vijay and Uma get married and shortly thereafter give birth to a girl Pinky. After some time Vijay has been specially appointed by the government to catch dangerous, deadly criminal Badey (Kader Khan) who is the leader of a bandit's gang, once they stop a wedding party bus on the Bombay-Poona Highway, loot, sexually molest females, and kill several passengers, Vijay is successful in arresting one of the gangsters, a Hotel Manager named Ranga, who colluded with the bandits, but Advocate Ghaswala (Asrani) defends him and gets him acquitted, resulting in the killing of the only eye-witness, a 10-year-old boy. In retaliation, Vijay beats up and kills Ranga, which results in his suspension. Then Vijay starts getting threats and has a bomb planted in his house. The panic-stricken family flees to the farmhouse, but bandits locate them there also and forcibly abduct Uma and Pinky after assaulting Prem Kishan. Vijay must now rush to save his wife and daughter, but he could save only his daughter; Uma dies by falling under the train. Now Vijay decides to take revenge against Badey and his gang, he eliminates them one by one and finally, surrenders him to the judiciary.
