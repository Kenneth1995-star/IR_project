Siri Sampadalu

Jagapathi Naidu (Gummadi) inculpates his brother-in-law Chakradhar (A.V. Subbarao Jr.) for his father Raghupathi Naidu’s (Nagaiah) death. This creates a rift in the joint family and Chakradhar leaves for the city with his wife Parvathi (Santhakumari) and son Prasad. Years pass by. Now grownups Jagapathi’s three daughters, Padma (Savitri), Latha (Vasanthi) and Rama (Girija) pursue higher studies in the city. They meet their cousin Prasad (ANR) and aunt Parvathi (Santhakumari). Love kindles between Padma and Prasad. A furious Jagapathi brings his daughters back to Sitaramapuram. Jagapathi loses all his wealth in charity. Money lender Bhujangam (Rajanala) brings his house under auction. Provoked by Bhujangam, Jagapathi hits him and is sentenced to three months imprisonment. Prasad buys ‘Anandanilayam’ in the auction.
Jagapathi’s accountant Garatayya (Ramana Reddy) steals his jewels and gives them to Bhujangam. Garatayya’s son Anand (Relangi) finds that out and informs Prasad. When Prasad meets Bhujangam for the jewels, Bhujangam darkens the room, hits him and throws him into the river. Jagapathi completes his sentence. Prasad in the guise of Athmaram receives him. Prasad calls everyone including Bhujangam to Anandanilayam. It is revealed that Bhujangam had hit Anand and not Prasad and Prasad had saved Anand from drowning. The culprits are thus exposed. Jagapathi regrets his hatred for his sister’s family. A repentant Bhujangam seeks pardon. Prasad marries Padma and Bhujangam’s son Madhu (Chalam) weds Latha.
