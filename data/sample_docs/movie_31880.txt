Lakshmi Prasad also loves a girl when he was in his village. He loses track of her when her family is migrated to some other city. Luckily Lakshmi Prasad finds her again. Nagalingam does not like the word 'Love'. So he opposes when his daughter proposes to marry Anand. This leads to conflict between the brothers and they split their property including their mother. She feels very bad about this. When she decided to live in a temple instead of witnessing the fight of her two sons, Anand's father (Kota Srinivasa Rao) takes her to his home. He advices his son to reunite their family because they split because of his love.
Anand along with Padma, Lakshmi Prasad and others enacts a story to change the minds of Nagalingam who finally agrees to marry his daughter to Anand, and their family reunites.
