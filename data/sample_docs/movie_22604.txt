Buddha Mountain

When singing on a pub stage, Nan Feng (Fan Bingbing) knocks a man unconscious. Nan Feng, her boyfriend Ding Bo (Chen Bolin), and another friend eat and drink by the roadside. Nan Feng, Ding Bo, Fatso and Teacher Chang are eating the supper. They are waiting for a train home at Buddha mountain railway station. When they back home, they put 2800 RMB in the suitcase.
The repaired car driven by Ding Bo stopped in front of them when they are eating by the road. Then they get in the car and stopped at a destroyed building. By the flashback scenes, we know this building was destroyed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. They took a picture helped by a monk in front of the destroyed Buddha temple.
Nan Feng, Ding Bo, Fatso and Teacher Chang go to the destroyed Buddha temple. They make some repairing and painting, and hang a bell. In the night, they talk to each other. The monk says his masterâ€™s real body is in the temple. Teacher Chang says she has done all she has to do. The next morning Nan Feng and his friends seek Teacher Chang and they find Teacher Chang is on the opposite cliff top. Nan Feng looks down to the cliff to see the train passing by, when she raises her head, she finds Teacher Chang is disappeared. Finally, they know Teacher Chang jumped off the cliff and died.
