The Book of Revelation

Daniel (Tom Long), a dancer, is drugged and abducted in an alley by three hooded women. They proceed to use him as a sex toy in an abandoned warehouse for about two weeks, before they take him in their car and dump him.
When he is left to return to his normal life, he loses his ability to dance and has problems relating with his environment. To reclaim his identity, he seeks revenge. He does so by hitting on every woman who responds to him hoping his abductors would be among them.
