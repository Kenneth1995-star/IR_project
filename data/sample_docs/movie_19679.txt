Incident at Midnight

Old Dr. Schroeder (Martin Miller), who has been struck off, attends a late night chemist every night for a prescription, and to observe Dr. Leichner (Anton Diffring), an ex-Nazi war criminal who has taken a new identity. Leichner, we discover, has a blonde wife (Sylva Langova), and a blonde mistress (Jacqueline Jones), who is blackmailing him. He is also involved in a drug scam involving two lockers and two keys, and aims to become a millionaire selling drugs. Meanwhile, a wounded bank robber has been taken to the dispensary for treatment, and to rendezvous with his gang leader. Old Dr. Schroeder finds himself attending to the robber's injuries.
