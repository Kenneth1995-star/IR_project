Kalyug Ke Avtaar

Ailing multi-millionaire Pratap promises that he will marry the first woman he sees the next morning. The first woman he sees is Reena, who comes from a poor family. Pratap proposes to her dad and introduces Reena to his mom. The marriage is celebrated with great pomp and ceremony. Years later a son, Shyam, is born to them. When Shyam grows up, he attends college and falls in love with fellow-collegian, Babli. When Pratap finds out that his son is in love, he meets and accepts Babli as his daughter-in-law right away. The only problem is Babli's brother, Dhamu Dada, who hates all millionaires, and is all set to oppose this marriage - tooth and nail.
