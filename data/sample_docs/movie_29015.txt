Or Iravu

The play Or iravu depicted events that happen in a single night. Older incidents were depicted using flashbacks. However, in the film version, flash backs were replaced with a linear narration.[6] Or iravu tells the story of a thief who breaks into a rich man's house without knowing that the rich man is his own father who had abandoned him and his mother long ago.[1]
