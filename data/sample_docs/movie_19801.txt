Three Hats for Lisa

Three young Cockneys take a day off work to meet an Italian movie star at Heathrow airport. She travels with them and their taxi driver in search of some typically British hats. The rule of the game is to steal a hat from its wearer. Lisa wants a bobby's helmet, a businessman's bowler, and the bearskin cap off a palace guard. A musical chase ensues around Swinging Sixties London, evading press and police.
