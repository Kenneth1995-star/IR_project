Lukka Chuppi

A group of friends from college, Raghuram (Jayasurya), Siddharth (Murali Gopy), Rafiq (Joju George), Annie (Chinnu Kuruvila), Radhika (Asmita Sood) and Benny (Dinesh Prabhakar), reunite after a long interval of 14 years under the insistence of Xavier (Saiju Kurup). Lukka Chuppi examines the emotional links between the main characters. The wives see a new side to their husbands, who are suddenly singing and laughing as they did during their college days. The events that follow their reunion form the crux of the story.
