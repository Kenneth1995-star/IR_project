Sembunyi: Amukan Azazil

Aishah is a Malay girl. During the Japanese Invasion of Malaya, she is knocked unconscious as she attempts to escape from invading Japanese soldiers. She wakes up in a strange silent town which seems to be unaffected by the invasion. The townsmen provide her with shelter, and she starts a new life. Soon she realises that there are other secrets being concealed by the town, such as a mysterious devil woods outside the town, and a demon called Azazil that preys on the villagers.
