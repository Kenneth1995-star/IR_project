Kadan Vaangi Kalyaanam

Rao Bahadur Ramadasu (T. S. Balaiah) borrows from all and sundry, and spends relentlessly. Zamindar Diwan Bahadur Mukunda Rao (S. V. Ranga Rao) is an innocent simpleton, and a good man. He is on the quest for the perfect match for his granddaughter Manjari (Savitri). Ramadasu wants his London-returned son, Dr. Raghu (T. R. Ramachandran) to marry Manjari and take all of Mukunda Rao's assets. Raghu is married to Leela (Jamuna), who is pretending to be a maid-servant and works in Raghu's home. Manjari is in love with Raja (Gemini Ganesan), Leela's brother, who reciprocates and is jailed for being a revolutionary and a part of the independence struggle. Raja's released from jail, and to set the affairs straight and teach Ramadasu a lesson, he pretends to be Bonkulamarri Raja, a big-time Zamindar and stays in Mukunda Rao's home, who now wants Raja to marry Manjari. Raghu gets involved in the drama without anyone's invite or knowledge, thus producing situational humor by posing as a prospective groom for Manjari and flirting with his maid/wife much to his father's horror. Confusion and comedy follow, while in the end Ramadasu learns his lesson and all the pairs are united.[3]
