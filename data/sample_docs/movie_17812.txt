Three Blind Mice

Three young Australian naval officers hit the streets of Sydney for one last night before being shipped out to Iraq. The dynamic between the three friends is uneasy; Sam (Ewen Leslie) has been mistreated at sea and is going AWOL, Dean (Toby Schmitz) has a fianc√© and the future in-laws to meet, and Harry (Matthew Newton) just loves playing cards. Throughout the night, the boy's struggle with what a night in Sydney can offer, as details of their last six months at sea emerge.[4]
