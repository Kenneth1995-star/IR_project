Anupama

Mohan Sharma (Tarun Bose), a successful businessman in Bombay, marries Aruna (Surekha Pandit) late in life, and is leading a happy married life, when, unfortunately, his wife dies during childbirth, leaving behind a young daughter, Uma (Sharmila Tagore), whom he cannot bear to see, except when he is drunk. Naturally, the daughter grows up all by herself and becomes highly introverted. As time passes, Mohan Sharma's health starts failing due to overwork and alcoholism; doctors suggest change of weather to a hill-station, Mahabaleshwar.
Meanwhile, Arun (Deven Verma), son of Mohan Sharma's friend Hari Mehta, and who is set to marry Uma, returns home after studying engineering abroad for five years, and joins them along with his friend, Ashok (Dharmendra), a writer and a teacher. Here things change when young Ashok enters Uma's life, but she cannot do anything to jeopardize the already fragile relationship between her and her father.
