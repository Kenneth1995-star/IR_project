My Voice, My Life

"My Voice, My Life" follows an unlikely group of misfit students from four Hong Kong schools cast together for a musical theater performance. From low self- esteem to blindness, each student confronts unique personal challenges in the process of developing his or her character. Teachers and administrators question whether this ragtag band will be able to work together, much less put on a successful show.[7]
Many of the musical theater troupe’s students come from Hong Kong’s least-desirable, "Band 3" secondary schools,[8] which admit the territory’s academically under-performing students. Others come from a school for the blind that seeks to teach its students how to perform basic tasks and function in the sighted world. Brought together to sing, dance, and act, the students question their own abilities and balk at the spotlight.[7]
