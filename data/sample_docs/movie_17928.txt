 The Daughter

Christian Nielsen, a recovering alcoholic, returns home to Australia from the United States for the wedding of his father, Henry, to his much younger housekeeper, Anna.
He finds out that Charlotte, Henry's previous housekeeper, and wife of his childhood friend, Oliver, had an affair with Henry, and that their teen-age daughter, Hedvig, is actually his half-sister. Christian's wife, who was supposed to also attend the wedding, instead dumps him by phone call. Christian, feeling miserable, begins drinking heavily again. At the wedding, hating Henry, for how he treated his mother, who committed suicide, Christian is compelled to tell Oliver about the affair.
Oliver is devastated, and, after realizing that Hedvig is not his daughter, leaves Charlotte. Christian then tells Hedvig the truth. She goes to Oliver, but he tells her he cannot look at her, after which she tries to commit suicide using her grandfather's shotgun. Oliver and Charlotte reunite in the hospital, where Hedvig lies in recovery.
