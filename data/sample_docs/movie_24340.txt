Sangram

A cop brings up his motherless son, spoiling him by succumbing to even his unnecessary demands, resulting in his getting familiar with ruffians and even gambling. The boy Kunwar (Shashi Kapoor) even once carries his father's pistol and fires it at a chum in a fit of rage. Timely help from his father (Nawab) saves him from the lock-up.
On growing up, Kunwar (Ashok Kumar) moves to a city and starts running a casino in the guise of a hotel. But he is betrayed by one of his own confidantes, and the police raid the hotel, and although gets hurt, manages to escape, and happens to meet his childhood companion â€“ (Baby Tabassum), who has grown up to be an attractive young woman (Nalini Jaywant). Kunwar's dark past catches up with him in the form of an old accomplice (Tiwari), who blackmails him as he is about to get married. He steals his deceased mother's jewellery helped by the dancing girl in his casino who, unwittingly, gets arrested.
To avenge the wrong, he goes after the criminals. During the fight in a running train, the gangster falls off and gets killed. When he returns with the stolen jewellery, the cops recognise him as the guy wanted in the casino raid, and put him behind bars. He escapes from prison on learning that his ladylove was going to be married off.
He kidnaps her and takes her to the dancing girl's house for refuge. The story takes yet another twist as the dancer feels betrayed, as she too loves him, and tries to alert the cops.
In a frenzy he shoots her, upsetting his own woman in the process. Cornered by cops, he indiscriminately fires, killing them all in the process. He is eventually shot dead by his own father when he tries to fool him by threatening to kill his own beloved though his pistol is empty.
But not before the customary dying speech.[3]
