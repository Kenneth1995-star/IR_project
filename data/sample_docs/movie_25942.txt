Kajal was the wife of advocate Mahendra who is handicapped. Mahendra fights for justice for the girl in court as his wife is the only witness of the rape. Sinhangia asked Kajal to withdraw the case, but Kajal refuses. Angry, Singhania along with his goons rape and kill her in front of helpless Mahendra. Without having any evidence, Mahendra does not prove the offence. Suddenly he saw a young man Surya, who looks like him and proposed to him to help him to avenge his wife's death. Surya was actually Mahendra's brother. Surya believed that their father made Surya an orphan. Initially he does not agree with the proposal of Mahendra, but after considering the situation of Mahendra's baby he accepted the proposal. The two brothers started killing the Singhania gang one by one.
