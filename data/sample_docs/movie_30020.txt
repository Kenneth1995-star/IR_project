Karpagam Vanthachu

Sakthivel (Arjun Sarja) is a poor orphan living alone in a slum and works as a cycle rickshaw puller. Being a short-tempored person, he cannot tolerate injustice so he is often caught in fights. He then meets the outspoken Karpagam (Raadhika) who deliver meals at home. They fall in love with each other.
Raja (Gowtham Sundararajan) and Sarathi (Y. G. Mahendra) are brothers and they have lost their parents at a young age. Sarathi is married to the arrogant Sarasu (Soorya) and Sarathi is totally submissive to his wife while his little brother Raja is bachelor. Sarasu is the daughter of the wealthy man Pasupathi.
Later, Raja and his collegemate Radha (Vidyasri) fall in love with each other. Radha is cocky and proud in nature. She is from a poor familyÂ : her father Thiruchitrambalam and her brother Madhavan spend their time by playing cards. Sarathi accepts for the marriage, but he asks to Radha to act as a soft-spoken and modest woman in front of Sarasu. Sarasu accepts too for their wedding. Raja and Radha finally get married.
After the marriage, Sarasu reveals her true colors. Sarasu and Radha then start to quarrel for simple matters, it leads to an ego clash between the two women. Raja also becomes a submissive husband like his brother. One day, their uncle Mayilsamy (S. S. Chandran) comes from Delhi to live with them. Mayilsamy thinks that the two uncontrollable women need a mother-in-law to calm them.
Mayilsamy hires Karpagam to act as his wife and he wants Karpagam to change the two women's behaviour. Afterward, Karpagam turns Radha and Sarasu lives into hell on earth. Sakthivel also enters their house to play as Karpagam's brother. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
