Ponvizha

Ponni (Suvalakshmi) lives with her grandmother and they are set aside by the villagers. Bharathi (Napoleon), a jobless man, landed in Ponni's village.
Ponni, the village chief's daughter, was going to marry. Before the marriage, the villagers including her father and Velusamy (Ranjith) met an accident. Most of the villagers died. Since this accident, the villagers began to hate Ponni. Bharathi was in fact the lorry driver who perpetrated the accident.
Bharathi is determined to save Ponni.
