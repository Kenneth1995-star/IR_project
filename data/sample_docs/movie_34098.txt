The Recruiter

Fifteen-year-old Mustafa (Olzhas Nusupbayev) — nicknamed "Shiza" for his weird behaviour in school — has no money, power or a girlfriend in his young life. Working for his mother’s boyfriend, Shiza scouts for fighters for the illegal, underground circuit of bare-knuckle fist-fighting.
However, his life changes forever when a young fighter is accidentally and mortally wounded in the ring. Before dying, the fighter asks Shiza to deliver his prize money to his wife Zinka (Olga Landina). Shiza takes the money to the now-widowed woman as promised. Upon meeting, Shiza falls in love with her. Suddenly, he finds direction as he is compelled to support and protect his new love no matter what the cost.
