Top Secret

George Potts, a plumber in a top secret government research plant, accidentally comes into possession of the plans for a revolutionary atomic weapon. As George leaves for his annual holiday, the research security team embarks on a nationwide search for the hapless 'sanitary engineer.' Meanwhile, the Russians get wind of the incident and intercept George, plying him with liquor and employment promises so that he'll hand over the plans to them. All the while, George never knows what the fuss is about: he thinks that the British and Soviet authorities are interested in his new plans for a modern plumbing system. The Russians offer him a job in the Kremlin doing research (on plumbing, he believes),and while there he falls in love with secret agent Tania, and discovers the true nature of the plans he is carrying.[4][5]
