Sket

Sisters Kayla (Aimee Kelly) and Tanya (Kate Foster-Barnes) move from Newcastle upon Tyne to commence a new life near their estranged father after their mother has died. Kayla is reluctant to reconcile with him. Meanwhile, drug dealer/gang-boss Trey (Ashley Walters) has instructed his female companion Shaks (Riann Steele) to murder a crackhead who has fallen behind on the payments for her drugs.
On her way home from a day of shopping, two youths harass Kayla on the bus. However, she manages to escape from harm after Danielle (Emma Hartley-Miller) and her crew beats them up. After her ordeal, Kayla decides to return home, instead of meeting her sister for a meal in a cafe. As Tanya leaves the cafe, she finds Trey attacking Shaks for not confronting the crackhead, and tries to help Shaks. Instead, Trey pounces on Tanya and leaves her in the street to die. Worrying that Kayla will reveal the identity of her sister's killer to the police, Trey sends his men to take her out. Realizing that she is slowly running out of options, Kayla realizes her only hope of survival and revenge is to get in tow with Danielle and her crew, but could her new friendship cost Danielle's life?
