Chirag comes from a wealthy background and assists his father, Siddharth Mehra, to maintain their farmland. His parents have been divorced due to incompatibility arising mainly due to his businesswoman mother, Shalini's hatred of tennis, and he lives with them every alternate month. Both would like him to get married, and accordingly Shalini picks London-based Kamiah, while Siddharth picks Bhatinda-based Manjeet Ahluwalia. Chirag, who sneaks off to practice tennis at night, is asked to make a choice but informs them that he is in love with a model named Anishka. The displeased couple decide to confront and put pressure on a struggling and unknowing klutz-like Anishka to leave their son alone but they do not succeed. At the end, Chirag's parents realize their mistake and together attend Chirag's tennis match and give blessings to Chirag and Anishka.
