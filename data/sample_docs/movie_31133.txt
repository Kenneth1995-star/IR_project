Anandan alias Bruce Lee (Jiiva) is a college graduate, but can't stand the idea of a 9-to-5 job. Instead, he studies martial arts with a group of similarly jobless friends. Attempting to recruit new students who can pay tuition and save their school, he gets involved in a brawl, and meets Shakthi (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of Police Deputy Commissioner Guarav (Nassar). Lee falls in love immediately, but Shakthi pepper-sprays him on both of their initial meetings.
When his grandfather (Girish Karnad) advises him to make the girl see him as a hero, Lee borrows a superhero costume and goes to see Shakthi, who is looking after her elder sister's kids. He tries to impress them with his martial arts skills, and accidentally ends up in the middle of a Police chase. He helps the police capture one of the bandits.
The gang of bandits, led by Anguchamy alias Dragon (Narain), come up with a plan to frame Lee for a series of robberies and murders. As police officers begin dying, Lee desperately tries to clear his name, and win the love of Shakthi.
