Pudsey: The Movie

The film is about 2012 Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog on an adventure. Pudsey uses his ability to walk on his hind legs and knock people over to save the day. Pudsey starts as a dog in a movie set, but he ends up fired after causing havoc. Pudsey runs away in disgrace and catches a bus, and there are several school kids on there.
When the bus stops, Pudsey runs down the street. Some bullies from the bus bully some other kids. Pudsey runs back and knocks the bullies over. The bullied kids take Pudsey home with them. They are siblings and their names are Molly, Tommy and George. Tommy does not speak much. The kid's mum gets rid of Pudsey so the family can move house after the dad died.
Molly, George and Tommy take Pudsey to a lady who looks after dogs. But the lady turns out to be evil after she says she is going to dye him pink and do horrible things to him like she has done to some poodles. Pudsey, because he is specially trained, opens the door and runs away, and jumps into a white van. The poodles escape too. The white van turns out to be the van that is moving the siblings' things, so Pudsey is moved to Chuffington with the family. Pudsey gets to speak.
