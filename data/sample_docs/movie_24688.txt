Rama returns to Ayodhya after being banished for fourteen years to the forest by his father Dashratha on the say of his second wife Kaikeyi. Rama's wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana had accompanied him in his exile. Sita was kidnapped by Ravan, King of Lanka, a war ensued with the death of Ravan and rescue of Sita. Valmiki in his hermitage has completed his epic Ramayana, and sends a messenger to King Rama asking permission to have it recited to him at his court. Good news arrives that Sita is expecting. However, things are set in motion when a washerwoman comes for justice as her husband throws her out of the house when her virtue is questioned as under unforeseen circumstances she spends the night with a man other than her husband. Things spiral out of control when the washerman and the public of Ayodhya question Sita's virtue following her forced captivity at Lanka. Sita has to go through a test of fire but even then the talk continues and Rama is forced to banish her to the forest. Lakshman takes her there and tells her of Ramaâ€™s intention of forsaking her. Appalled she jumps into the Ganga, but is saved by the sage Valmiki. Being pregnant, he reminds her of her duty as a queen and the need for her to provide heirs. She stays in the hutment anonymously and gives birth to twins called Luv and Kusha. Time passes and Rama is miserable with the step he had to take. Sage Vashishta has arranged for a Yagna to be performed by Rama. Valmiki's Ramayana is read by the boys and they sing out the verses. The twins meet are taken by Valmiki to Ayodhya to attend the Yagna. The children are unaware of their lineage. Valmiki makes them recite the story he has written which impresses Rama but he too is unaware of who the boys are. Finally after a short war between father and sons, they are united along with Sita.
