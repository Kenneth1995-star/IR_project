Bilhaanan

A king searches for a suitable teacher to educate his daughter Yamini. Finally, he engages the poet Bilhana. To prevent any romance from developing between the two, the king tells Yamini that Bilhana is blind, and tells Bilhana that Yamini is deformed. He hangs a curtain between the two while the lessons are in progress. One day, amused by the sight of the full moon, Bilhana sings a poem in its praise. Yamini, wondering how a blind man can compose a poem about the moon, pulls down the curtain and finds that Bilhana is attractive and youthful, and he finds the princess attractive in turn. The two fall in love and decide to marry. The king opposes the marriage and when the lovers do not listen to him, he sentences them both to death. The king's friends and people protest and, understanding the power of true love, he forgives the lovers and gets them married.[1]
