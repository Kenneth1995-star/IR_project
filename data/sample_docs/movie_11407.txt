Getting Lucky

Bill Higgins (Steven Cooke), a high school senior who longs to score a date with cheerleader Krissi (Lezlie Z. McCraw), discovers an alcoholic leprechaun in a beer bottle. The leprechaun, named Lepkey, must grant Bill three wishes before he's allowed to return to Ireland. Bill's wishes end up causing more trouble due to Lepkey's alcoholism and diminished magical skills.
