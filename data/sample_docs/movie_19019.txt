Ghost Ship

A newlywed couple decide to buy an old yacht "The Cyclops", and fix it up as their home. Soon after the purchase they begin to hear rumours about the ship's dark past. At first they do not believe the rumours; that is, until they start to experience some unexplained ghostly events for themselves. They then hire paranormal investigator, Dr. Fawcett (Hugh Burden) and his medium, Mrs. Manley (Mignon O'Doherty) to determine whether there are ghosts on the ship. The paranormal investigator uncovers the murders of the former yacht owner's wife and her lover. He also discovers that the bodies were hidden somewhere on board the yacht. The medium spiritually intervenes and rids the yacht of the haunting spirit.
