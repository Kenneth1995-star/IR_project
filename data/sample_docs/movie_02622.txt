The Marshal of Mesa City

Because the corrupt sheriff, Jud Cronin, won't leave her alone, schoolteacher Virginia King decides to leave Mesa City for good. Cronin's cronies intercept her stagecoach, but a passenger, retired lawman Cliff Mason, foils their plans.
Virginia must accompany Cliff back to town because the stagecoach is damaged. There they discover a marshal has been murdered by Cronin's hired gun Pete Henderson, who gets away with the crime in court. Cliff is offered the marshal's badge and Duke Allison rides to town to become his deputy. In a shootout, Cronin is killed by Duke, who also perishes. Cliff and Virginia leave town together.
