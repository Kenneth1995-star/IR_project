Mayalokam

Sambaripura King, Kambhoja Raju (Govindarajula Subba Rao) has seven wives and six children from his first six wives. When his youngest wife Manikyamba (Kannamba) is pregnant, the Rajaguru (M. C. Raghavan) predicts that her son would be the next king. Upset at this, the eldest wife (â€˜Radio' Bhanumathi), who feels her son Navabhoja Raju (C.S.R) should be a natural choice, plots with the other wives and poisons the mind of the king, who banishes Manikyamba from the kingdom.
Lord Siva (Vedantam Raghavaiah), in the guise of a tribal, takes her to a tribal colony in the forest, where Manikyamba delivers a boy, who grows into a handsome youth, Sarabandi Raju (Akkineni Nageshwara Rao). The repentant Kambhoja becomes sick and his six sons set out to bring medicine to cure his illness. Sarabandi comes to the kingdom to reunite his parents. He too goes in search of the medicine for his father. With the help of Rathnagandhi (Santhakumari) and Yojanagandhi (M. V. Rajamma), whom he meets on way, he gets the potion that can cure his father. He also gets his six brothers freed from the captivity of the vicious Rangasani (S. Varalakshmi). Sarabandi marries Rathnagandhi and Yojanagandhi and brings them with him. The six wives realize their folly, Manikyamba returns to the palace and Sarabandi Raju is crowned the king.[5]
