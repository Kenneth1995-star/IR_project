Sidharth (Indrajith) is the creative head of a prominent advertising agency. He has just been transferred to Kochi from Bangalore. Veena is Siddhu's girlfriend and runs a contemporary dance troupe. Icha (Nivin Pauly) is Veena's friend and a waiter in an upmarket coffee shop. When they fail to find a suitable place for Siddhu to stay, Veena suggests that he share Icha's place until he finds his own accommodation. Siddhu instantly agrees, but Icha agrees reluctantly. Soon Siddharth and his girlfriend Veena find themselves caught in a horrific riddle - they find Icha at two different places at the same time. Their search for answers forms the crux of the story.
