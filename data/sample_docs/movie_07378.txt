Mice Follies

Ralph Crumden and Ned Morton are walking home from the Raccoon Lodge at two o'clock in the morning. Ned stops to lasso a cat, but when Ralph grabs the cord, he gets dragged in and pounded by the cat.
The cat enters the house next to Ralph's house, finding a chance to grab the mice. The cat puts his mouth against the mousehole so that Ralph and Ned enter the cat's body. Ralph lights a match in the darkness making smoke and the cat regurgitates the mice. The mice walk on thinking they entered the wrong place. The cat goes into Ralph's house through a grate. Ralph and Ned cautiously enter the house thinking their wives are sleeping soundly. Ralph greets "Alice" and grabs her new fur coat, ripping a piece of fur off the cat. In response the cat slices Ralph. Ned tries to talk with "Trixie", but the cat massacres Ned. Both mice march in to confront their "wives", but the cat beats them up and the two mice go to sleep at the park to get away from their "aggressive wives".
Alice and Trixie return from the movies to Ralph's house cautiously entering, but the cat beats them up as well. Both ladies go to sleep at the park to get away from their "aggressive husbands". Unbeknownst to them, their husbands are asleep on the other side of the same bench.
