Kaithi Kannayiram

A tough jailor's (‘Javert' Seetharaman) kid (‘Baby' Savithiri) is kidnapped by a vengeful murderous prisoner (Veerappa). Another prisoner (Manohar) who has lost his child (‘Master' Sridhar) escapes from the prison. He takes up the task of rescuing the jailor's missing kid. The duty-conscious jailor is only keen on nabbing him. The child is taught music by a pretty teacher (Raja Sulochana) and the song, "Konji konji pesi', becomes the link for the rescue of the child kept prisoner in a building. Unable to locate the child who is held captive, the music teacher goes around the town singing the song. On hearing the song, the child emerges from her hideout and utters the lines outwitting the guards. The child is rescued after a long fight between the two prisoners.
