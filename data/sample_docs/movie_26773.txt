That Girl in Yellow Boots

That Girl in Yellow Boots is a thriller tracing Ruth (Kalki Koechlin), a British woman who lost her sister to suicide a couple of years ago. She comes to India, to search for her father, an Indian descent man, a man she hardly knew but cannot forget, due to a letter he had written to her, asking her to seek him out. Without a work permit, desperation drives her to work at a massage parlour, where she offers both standard massages and "happy endings". Torn between several schisms, Mumbai becomes the alien but yet strangely familiar backdrop for Ruth's quest. She struggles to find her independence and space even as she is sucked deeper into the labyrinthine of the city's underbelly. She also dates a drug addict Prashant (Prashant Prakash), who is simultaneously her saviour and tormentor. A city that feeds on her misery, a love that eludes her. In what is possibly also seen as a commentary on the cult of godmen in India, her father is shown to be a follower of one such religious cult. The film ends with Ruth hanging up her yellow boots,and quitting her job at the massage parlour and also presumably leaving the country to go back to Britain; her quest having come to a shocking end.
