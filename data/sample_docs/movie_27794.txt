Thekkedathu Ramankutty (Dileep) is a marriage organizer. He meets Gauri (Navya Nair) while arranging the marriage for her sister Radhika (Jyothirmayi), daughter of a family friend Ambattu Thampi (Lalu Alex). Radhika's fianc√©e does not turn up for the marriage. Ramankutty suggests that his brother Dr. Sivadas (Bobby Alumoodan) will be ready for the marriage and Dr. Sivadas and Radhika gets married on the same day itself. Ramankutty and Gauri fall in love. But on the day of their engagement, Radhika dies in a kitchen fire accident.
After a long time, the family fixes Ramankutty and Gauri's marriage. On the previous day of marriage Gauri gets an electrick shock. When Thampi visits the astrologer Meppattu Thirumeni (Thilakan) to see the horoscope match, he tells them that women married into the Thekkedathu family are fated to die young. Thampi, scared for his only remaining daughter's life, requests Ramankutty to back out of the marriage. Saddened and yet wanting to do the right thing, Ramankutty calls off the wedding on the pretense of not being comfortable with Gauri's close relations with her cousin Unni (Kunchako Boban). Devastated by this allegation, Gauri backs out of the marriage, only to find the truth later. She runs out in search of Ramankutty and gets involved in a road accident on the way. She is rushed to the hospital and while still battling for life, she wishes that Ramankutty tie the wedding knot before her operation. Ramankutty ties the knot, fearing the worst. Miraculously, Gauri comes out alive.
The story is told in flashback by an aged Ramankutty who bids farewell to his spellbound teenage audience at the temple which is filmed in a beautiful location and at the end he joins his wife Gauri in lighting the lamp.
