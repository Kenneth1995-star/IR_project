Charachar

Lakha (Rajit Kapoor) comes from a family of bird catchers, but questions the value of catching birds. He, and the older Bhushan (Sadhu Meher), sell their caged birds to the local dealer. Lakha's wife, Sari (Laboni Sarkar), complains that he is not ambitious enough because he cares more for the birds than for her, and she starts meeting Natobar. Kalicharan, a city dealer, suggests they sell their birds directly to him. So Bhushan and Lakha take their next catch of birds on the train to Calcutta. Kalicharan invites them to a feast for the ceremony of the birds, with disastrous consequences.
