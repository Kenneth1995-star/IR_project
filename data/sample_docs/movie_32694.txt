Hitudu

The story starts off in a backward village called Paderu. Sitaram (Jagapathi Babu) is an Ex-Naxalite who leaves his gang and sets up a school in Paderu to encourage education. On the other hand, Abhilasha (Meera Nandan) is a happy go lucky girl who is quite brilliant in her studies. Seeing her talent, Sitaram takes up the responsibility of teaching her. One fine day, Abhilasha lands herself in huge trouble. Citing these problems, Sitaram makes necessary arrangements and sends her off to another town for further studies. Rest of the story is as to how Sitaram manages to help Abhilasha complete her studies in spite of all these problems.
