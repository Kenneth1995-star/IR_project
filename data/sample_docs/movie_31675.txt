Zamindar Jannardhan Rao (Gummadi) is a rich and wealthy man. He has two sons, the elder son is Krishna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), and is good, virtuous, and devoted to his family, and expected to marry Radha (Jayalalitha) and younger one is Bhaskar/ Baachi (Jaggayya) is a vagabond wayward person having all bad habits. While disciplining Baachi, Jannardhan Rao has a heart attack and passes away, leaving the administration of the estate to Krishna. This does not auger well with Baachi, and they attempt to force Krishna to sign the estate over to them. When they fail, they conspire to kill him and take over the estate. Krishna overhears this and goes along with Baachi's plan to kill him. He then returns as Seenu, his look-alike, in order to set things right. Things seem to be going well until Krishna finds himself in a tight corner when he is accused of killing himself. Rest of the story is how Krishna comes out of the tight loop.
