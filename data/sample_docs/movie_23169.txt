Opium and the Kung-Fu Master

Master Tie Qiao San (Ti Lung), the leader of the Ten Tigers of Canton, is the chief coach of China's militia. At that time, the opium ban was in use, but public sale of opium was widely available. Many bureaucrats were taking opium, a trend that Tie followed. As Tie takes opium, his physical skills were declining. Seeing how Tie's skills are declining, opium store owner Rong Feng (Chen Kuan-tai) challenges Tie to a public duel. Tie struggles to fight Rong and was in serious danger until his disciple Lu Guasi (Robert Mak) steps in to rescue him before dying from his injuries. Seeing his disciple killed by Rong, Tie vows to seek revenge.
