Manasukkul Mathappu

Shekar (Prabhu) becomes mentally ill after his girlfriend Anita (Lizy) dies because of an electric short circuiting accident during a rock concert. Shekar is admitted into an institution managed by Nagaraj (Senthamarai).
With the help of a young doctor Geetha (Saranya Ponvannan), who is Nagaraj's daughter, and an old friend Raja (Sarath Babu), Shekar slowly regains his memory and mental equilibrium. He and Geetha soon fall in love. But Nagaraj has already arranged Geetha's marriage with someone else, so he opposes the lovers.
When Nagaraj finds that Geetha and Shekar are adamant, he performs a surgery (lobotomy) on Shekar that puts him into a state of coma. Raja feels that death would be preferable to vegetative life and kills Shekar. He confronts Nagaraj and confesses to the euthanasia. He then tries to kill Nagaraj for ruining Shekar's life, but Geetha suddenly kills her father before Raja can, and she loses her mental equilibrium. She is admitted into the same institution as a patient.
