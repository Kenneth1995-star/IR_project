Yesterday's Hero

Rod Turner (McShane), a former star footballer now an alcoholic and playing in a minor league, is persuaded to attempt a comeback to the professional game with "the Saints", owned by a wealthy pop star who, when young, had idolized Turner. When a striker gets injured, Turner is signed by the Third Division team and helps to get them to a Cup Final, where they play "Leicester Forest". But can he stop drinking and make it to the final? Scenes of the Cup Final include footage from the 1979 Football League Cup Final between Southampton and Nottingham Forest at Wembley Stadium.
