The Five

Eun-ah was living a perfect, happy life with her family until a sociopathic young man named Jae-wook brutally and senselessly murders her husband and daughter in front of her eyes. Barely escaping alive herself, Eun-ah is left half-paralyzed and wheelchair-bound. After her recovery, she grows fixated on taking revenge on him. Two years later, following a long search, she hones in within striking distance of the killer. Faced with such a dangerous adversary and her immobility, Eun-ah gathers four people marginalized by society, each with a different skill, to help her kill Jae-wook. In exchange, she is prepared to give them something they desperately need -- her organs. All four accomplices -- which include a North Korean defector, an ex-gangster, a doctor, and a cop -- are in need of organ transplants for various reasons, and Eun-ah promises them her organs once her revenge is complete. But things don't go as planned, and the killer turns the tables and starts hunting them himself.[10][11][12][13]
