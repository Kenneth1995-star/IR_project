Chained Heat II

Carol Henderson (Linda Blair) is an immature and naive teenager who is sentenced to 18 months in a women's prison for killing a man by accident after driving drunk. Once she arrives, she meets the vicious and perverted Warden Backman (John Vernon). She also encounters the two kingpin prisoners, Ericka (Sybil Danning) and Duchess (Tamara Dobson), who are the leaders of factions in the facility's seething racial tensions. There are also the drug-dealing lesbian rapists and the prostitutes, who answer to the warden's assistant, Captain Taylor (Stella Stevens). In the meantime, Taylor's lover is clandestinely having an affair with Ericka. When the facility's corrupt administration goes too far, racial considerations are put aside as convicts of all colors and nationalities band together to fight them.[3]
