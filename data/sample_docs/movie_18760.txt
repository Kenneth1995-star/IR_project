Dancing with Crime

Boyhood friends and comrades in the Army, Ted Peters (Richard Attenborough) and Dave Robinson (Bill Rowbotham) are back in civvies. Ted becomes a taxi driver and hopes to marry Joy Goodall (Sheila Sim), a pretty chorus girl. Dave, seeking easy money, joins a gang which has its headquarters in a suburban palais-de-danse. The gang is headed by a man called Gregory (Barry Jones), and includes Paul Baker (Barry K. Barnes), and petty crooks Sniffy and Pogson. Ted refuses to join them.[1]
