Faces in the Crowd

Anna Marchant (Milla Jovovich) witnesses a murder by a serial killer called Tearjerker Jack. Jack chases and attacks her, but she eludes him by falling from a bridge. Anna wakes from a coma one week later and is diagnosed with prosopagnosia, also known as "face blindness". Able to recognize objects but not faces, she works with police detective Sam Kerrest (Julian McMahon) to stop Tearjerker Jack (David Atrakchi) before he can murder her.
