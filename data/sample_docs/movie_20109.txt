The Alf Garnett Saga

With the Garnetts' Wapping home demolished, Alf and his family are installed in a high-rise council flat. Alf struggles with "living in the sky”, using lifts (which frequently break down due to power cuts "caused by the striking miners") and walking long distances to the local pub.[3]
