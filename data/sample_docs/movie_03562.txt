The Girl from Monterrey

In a Mexican nightclub, some American fight promoters witness Alberto 'Baby' Valdez, the brother of Lita Valdez knock out a champion fighter. At first Lita is angered that her brother has quit his law studies to become a fighter, but the two move to the United States. Lita literally bumps into reigning champion Jerry O'Leary with the three becoming inseparable friends. However the American fight promoters force Alberto and Jerry to fight each other or face suspension.
