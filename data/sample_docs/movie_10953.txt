Ellie DeWitt (Rebecca De Mornay) is a former U.S. Marine who wants to become an FBI Agent. However, while she has great physical skills, she struggles at the academic level. Conversely, her roommate Janis Zuckerman (Mary Gross) is as smart as they come, but physically very weak. Overcoming the male recruits' assumptions of them, Ellie and Janis team up to help each other through the basic training so they can both become federal agents.
During their training, Ellie and Janis must deal with an instructor who seems determined to fail the pair, a fellow trainee who seems more interested in flirting with Ellie (until Ellie asserts her Marine training and pins him against the wall in one exercise), and befriend a geeky co-trainee who seems unable to complete the smallest task.
Joining forces, the three tackle the final practice simulation, (badly) forging the instructor's signature ('he sneezed') and breaking into the telephone room to discover the location of the "hostage" and use their radio to redirect the other agents to make sure they don't find the hostage first.
The two graduate with honors and in the credits scene, both Ellie and Janis are assigned as partners to the Los Angeles office.
