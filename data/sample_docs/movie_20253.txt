Paper Tiger

Mr Bradbury (David Niven), an apparently well-educated, ex-military Englishman is hired as tutor to Koichi Kagoyama (played by Kazuhito Ando), the son of a Japanese ambassador. Bradbury becomes a trusted friend, who boasts about his heroic service in the British Army, but some painful truths are revealed after he and the boy are kidnapped by political terrorists. It comes to the point when Mr Bradbury has to live up to the "action man" he makes himself out to be.
