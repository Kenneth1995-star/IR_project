Like You Know It All

Arthouse filmmaker Goo can't seem to direct a hit, but at least the critics love him. He goes to Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province to judge the local film festival, but the common practice for jurors is to schmooze by day, drink at night, and sleep through movies. He bumps into an old friend Boo Sang-yong in town and drinks till he passes out, but not before soundly offending his friend's wife.
After Jecheon, Goo heads to Jeju Island to give a college lecture. There, he meets up with a former mentor, who it turns out is now married to Goo's ex-unrequited lover.[3][4][5]
