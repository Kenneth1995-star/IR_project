The Gamblers

Jason Robards Sr. (Carvel Emerson) and George Fawcett (Emerson Jr.) play a father-and-son team of cons, who gamble their firmâ€™s assets. Emerson Jr. is caught investing money that doesn't belong to him and is indicted on a swindling charge. The plot gets spicy when the District Attorney handling the case is his former sweetheart, Catherine Darwin's husband. This situation gives the DA an opportunity to prosecute his romantic rival.
