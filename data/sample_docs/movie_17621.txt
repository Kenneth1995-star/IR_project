Fatal Bond

Joe Martinez (Jerome Ehlers) is a man without a home or a known past. His only friend seems to be the Valiant car that rockets him through time and across landscape. He is a loner with a violent temper that bristles whenever he feels society is grinding down on him. If anyone encroaches upon his sense of freedom (be he a bouncer or a criminal), Joe explodes - a quick headbutt followed by a frantic attack of a swirling fists.
On one such occasion, he is saved from arrest by Leonie (Linda Blair), a hairdresser with an American accent and a poor love life. She is clearly attracted to Joe's sexual charisma and his anti-social nature. In some ways, Leonie personifies those women who are drawn to unlovable men, who find reasons to stay when most other would have fled.[2]
