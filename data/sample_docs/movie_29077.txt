Ratha Paasam

Raja (Shanmugham) is a petty thief living around the streets of Bombay, indulging in pickpocketing. In the same city lives Rani (Anjali Devi), who makes a living through dancing. The two meet and fall in love.
Raghu (Bhagavathi), the owner of a cycle company, lives luxuriously with his wife Sarala (Draupadi) and children in Madras. Madhu (Balaiah), his manager, has been misappropriating the company funds with the help of his lover Manorama (Vidyavathi) who Raghu is later attracted to. The company is soon closed due to losses, putting Sarala and her children in poverty.
Raghu leaves for Bombay to seek new avenues, leaving his family behind. Sarala goes in search of him. One day, Raja picks Raghu's pocket and finds photographs in his purse which reveal that Raghu is his brother. He goes in search of his long-lost brother who does not bother to recognise him because of his snobbery. Sarala faces many problems and after several incidents, the problems are solved and the family is reunited.[2]
