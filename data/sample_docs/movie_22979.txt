A Taste of Cold Steel

Three sisters unite with a cousin to avenge their father who was killed by a group of noblemen with ties to a criminal gang. Many action sequences depict the sisters and cousin cutting down enemies in dramatic fashion. In the climactic fight sequence the sisters manage to complete revenge by killing the noblemen responsible for their father's death. However, other members of the gang capture them and begin to enact a variety of sadistic tortures including forcing them to drink each other's menstrual blood. Finally, the sisters are able to escape bondage, steal back the Violet Light Sword, and use it to slice their way to freedom.
