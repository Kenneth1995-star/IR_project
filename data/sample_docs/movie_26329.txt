Two British nationals are killed by a ferocious tiger in Corbett National Park in India. This incident follows several other tiger attacks, and many deaths result, prompting National Geographic to send a correspondent, Krish Thapar (John Abraham) to the national park and ascertain what really happened. Thapar is accompanied by his wife Riya (Esha Deol). A group of youngsters, consisting of Dev Malhotra (Vivek Oberoi), Ishika (Lara Dutta), Sajid (Kushal Punjabi) and Vishal (Vishal Malhotra), on a hunting trip also arrive in corbett National Park in the hopes of sighting and shooting some big prey.
Both the Thapars and the youngsters meet with each other, and seek the guidance of a local called Kaali (Ajay Devgn) after he saves them from a streak of tigers. On their way out from the national park, some of the members of the group are mysteriously killed when Sajid is secretly murdered for using a pistol, Vishal dies while surviving the car crash, and Riya is hanged in a well drowning her to death. Kaali tells them about a recent story of how hunting was destroying the jungle. One local guide got very upset by this and started leading tourists astray and getting them killed by tigers. When this started affecting the tourism, other villagers and local guides beat that guide and threw him to the tigers. The local villagers now believe that his ghost is killing everyone who breaks the jungle's rules.
It is finally understood that Kaali is the spirit of the dead tourist guide and is responsible for the recent deaths. Somehow Krish, Dev and Ishika manage to get out of the national park.
