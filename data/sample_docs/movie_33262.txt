Evangelion: Death and Rebirth

The first part, Death, is a 70-minute-long edit of the first 24 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion in the form of a clip show, with additional footage not seen in the original broadcast. (The footage would later be integrated into the Japanese Laserdisc and the American and European Platinum Collection releases of the series, as "Director's Cut" versions of episodes 21-24.)
The second part, Rebirth, consists of 27 minutes of entirely new animation that would eventually form the first third of the film The End of Evangelion, released four months later. Because of time constraints, Rebirth only covers the initial preparations of the Human Instrumentality Project and the invasion of the Geofront by the JSSDF, ending with the arrival of the Mass Production Evas. (In The End of Evangelion, the final version of episode 25 concludes with the end of Asuka's fight with the Mass Production Evas.)
