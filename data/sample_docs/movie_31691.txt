Shri Krishnavataram

The movie covers all episodes of Lord Krishna's life. Krishna's birth, his captive parents and the prediction that Kamsa would be killed by Devaki's eighth child makes the first episode. After defeating Kamsa, he marries Rukmini, fights with Jambavantha to procure the Samanthaka Mani and gets his daughter Jambavanthi's hand in marriage. Satrajit, who initially proclaims that Krishna has the Mani regrets his mistake and gives his daughter Satyabhama in marriage to Krishna.
An example of Bhakti and devotion to the friendship like Kuchelopakhyanam is also pictured beautifully.
After Sisupala completes his 100 sins, he defeats and kills him, thus regaining his entry back to Vishnu's abode. Kuchela's episode is followed by Draupadi's humiliation where Krishna saves her honor. The great war of Kurukshetra takes place after the negotiations (Rayabharam) between the cousins fails. Krishna's Geetopadesam to Arjuna is also shown. Finally, he saves Bheema from Dhritarashtra's ire after Bheema kills Duryodhana. Balarama wades deep into the ocean after the gory war, while Lord Krishna ends his Avataram owing to a hunter's mistake.
