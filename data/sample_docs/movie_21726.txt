The Third Walker

Kate Maclean (Colleen Dewhurst) and Munro Maclean (William Shatner) have two twin boys, Andrew (Andrew Rankin) and James (Darren DiFonzo). One day at school, Andrew has a new classmate named Étienne Blanchard (Simon Rankin), who looks virtually identical to Andrew and has the same birthday; after medical tests confirm that Étienne and James were switched at the hospital, however, Étienne's mother Marie (Monique Mercure) leaves town rather than complying with the court order to surrender custody of Étienne to the Macleans in exchange for James. This development fractures the Maclean family, as Kate's unrelenting obsession with regaining custody of Étienne destroys her relationships with both Munro and James.[2]
Years later following Munro's death, the now adult Andrew (David Meyer) and Étienne (Anthony Meyer) reunite at his funeral for the first time since the incident; while Andrew has maintained a brotherly bond with James (Frank Moore) despite their mother's attitude, it too is now tested by Andrew's desire to build a closer relationship with his real twin.[2]
