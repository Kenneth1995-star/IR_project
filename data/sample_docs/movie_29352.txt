Ramanathan and Seetha are a married couple. They face difficulties after the former loses his job. Ramanathan wants to help his younger brother Ravi to pursue MBBS, and in order to fund his education, he takes an insurance policy for ₹1 lakh (equivalent to ₹43 lakh or US$66,000 in 2017). Ramanathan then fakes his death by using a mutilated man's corpse near a railway line. Ramanathan leaves his diary there and also places his ring on the deceased man's finger. Ramanathan is declared dead by the police. Seetha, who is traumatised by her husband's "death", requests Ravi to pursue his education using the insurance money she receives.
Ravi eventually becomes disinterested in his education. Using the insurance money given by Seetha, he takes to gambling on race horses and becomes rich. He falls in love with Vijaya, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. A family friend (R. S. Manohar) discovers that Ramanathan is still alive and shares this information with Seetha, but she chooses to keep it a secret. Ravi misunderstands Manohar's night-time visits; assuming that Seetha is having an affair with Manohar, he begins to taunt her. Seetha later arranges Ravi's marriage with Vijaya, whose father commits suicide after having been cheated by an insurance fraud. Ravi, still unaware that Ramanathan is alive, realises later that he has been responsible for his brother's "death", surrenders to the police and is taken to court before a judge.
During Ravi's trial, Manohar, who is a lawyer by profession, asserts that Ramanathan is not dead and Ravi decided to plead guilty to murdering someone who is still alive and well. Soon after, Ramanathan appears in court and tells them the truth. Ravi is exonerated, while Ramanathan is arrested for cheating the insurance company by faking his own death.[1]
