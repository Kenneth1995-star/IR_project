Maayavi

Abhes Balayya (Suriya), the guide-con man-thief, is footloose and fancy-free. He and his acolyte Sathyaraj (Sathyan), have no hang ups in life. He is also a huge fan of actor Ajith Kumar.
Balayya's problems start when he and Sathyaraj land up in a huge villa on the beachfront. He is there for making some quick money. It is actually actress Jothika's (Jyothika) house. When they realize it, they want to replace what they have taken. But, as it happens, the actress herself catches them and creates a huge issue out of it. For their efforts, they are put behind the bars.
Jyothika just doesn't like Balayya at all. Out of all, the two have their run-ins, and again Balayya is jailed. So out to take revenge on her and kidnap her. Just about when the whole industry and her family tries to trace Jyothika, she understands the real Balayya. In the end Balayya comes to see her and gives her a gift. The gift is the photographs they took together.
