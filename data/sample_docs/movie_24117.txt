Chhayamoy

Indrajit is a UK based scholar. While working to preserve historical documents he find a parchment from which he learns about treasures hidden in an old Jamindar palace in Simulgarh, a village of West Bengal. Actually Indrajit is the descendant of the jamindar's family. He comes to the village, finds out the treasure with the help of one goldsmith but, a local goon Gagan Sapui accuses him of robbery, beats him up and expels him out of the village. Sapui wants to melt those coins to make new jewellery. After being beaten up, Indrajit goes to forest near the village where he meets Chhayamoy, a benevolent ghost. After listening the incidence from Indrajit, Chhayamoy decides to teach Sapui a lesson.[4]
