Three Stripes in the Sun

Sgt. Hugh O'Reilly and his friend, Cpl. "Nebby" Muhllendorf, are assigned to peacetime Osaka, Japan after the end of World War II. Still upset over his experiences at Pearl Harbor, O'Reilly unsuccessfully asks his colonel for a transfer.
O'Reilly's prejudices continue to surface, particularly when his wallet is missing and presumed stolen. After he finds a Japanese man with it, O'Reilly intends to seek retribution until he learns that the man runs an orphanage and was simply returning a wallet that he found.
O'Reilly and Nebby visit the orphanage and, moved by its impoverished conditions, donate money and food. O'Reilly also develops a romantic interest in a local girl, Yoku, but believes a future together would be difficult. He decides to break off contact with Yoku after the outbreak of conflict in Korea, but when he and Nebby are wounded and return to Japan, he and Yoku decide to try a life together in the United States.
