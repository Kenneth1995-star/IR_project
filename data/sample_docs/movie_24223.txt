Deccan Queen

When Lala Niranjanmal dies, his two children, daughter Aruna (Aruna Devi) and son are cheated out of their inheritance by the fraudulent trustees. They incriminate Aruna in a crime for which she has to go to jail while her brother drifts away penniless and out of his mind. On release from jail, Aruna has vengeance on her mind and she becomes the fearful Deccan Queen. The police are quickly after her and police Inspector Suresh (Surendra) is put in charge to apprehend her. Vrinda (Aruna Devi) works for an Insurance company and meets Suresh. They both fall in love. It is soon realised that Vrinda and Deccan Queen resemble each other. Deccan Queen takes advantage of this. After several action scenes and the kidnapping of Vrinda by Aruna, things are sorted out when Suresh helps the Deccan Queen reveal the dishonest Trustees.
