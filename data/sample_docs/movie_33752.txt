Majocco Shimai no Yoyo to Nene

Yoyo and Nene work as "Noroiya" (cursers) using magic in a fantasy world. One day a big tree suddenly appears in a forest, and tall buildings that look like they are from another world (our world) can be seen entangled in it. The two sisters go there to investigate, and Yoyo gets transported to our world. Yoyo then encounters two children who are startled by her sudden appearance and rush back home. But, at home they find their parents turning into monsters.[2]
