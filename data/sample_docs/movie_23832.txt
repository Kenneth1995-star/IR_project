In his work field, he meets the lovable femme fatal boss Anna (Solenn Heussaff), who he falls in love head over heels with. Working hard as he tries to impress, Ramon unknowingly digs the graveyard of three victims of injustice whose souls begin to haunt and possess Ramon's body for vengeance; thus ruining his courtship and eventual relationship with Anna. Meanwhile, to prove the purest of his intentions, Ramon needs to stand up for Anna against her father Don Demetrio (Joey Marquez) who is a syndicate leader. But because of Ramon's cowardice, this comes as a major challenge, on top of the disturbance brought by the three ghosts headed by Anastacio "Chemerut" Balbitero, Jr. (John Lapus). As Ramon tries to solve the mystery behind these hauntings, he discovers that ghosts are trying to revenge against Don Demetrio.
