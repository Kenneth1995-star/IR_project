Palayathu Amman

The film starts with a saint in a gurukulam announcing to his students that Devi's birth to kill the evil shall come soon. The Satan (Charan Raj) kills the saint, but Devi's birth is not stopped. It grows up as a child for Ramki and Divya Unni.
The child gets all kinds of harm from the Satan, but the Goddess Palayathu Amman (Meena) saves it every time. At the same time, Divya Unni thinks that Palayathu Amman wants to take away her child, so she tries to save it from her.
At last, the child is kidnapped and about to be killed when Palayathu Amman kills the Satan and returns the child to her parents.
