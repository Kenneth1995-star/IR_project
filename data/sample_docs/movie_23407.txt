Beyond Hypothermia

Woo Chin Lin plays a brilliantly skilled hitwoman, Shu Li Fan, who for most of the movie has no name. She also has no family or friends, and for reasons not entirely clear, has a lower than average body temperature. She was rescued as a child from war-ravaged Cambodia, and raised by Mei (Shirley Wong), who is the widow of an assassin. Mei teaches the child the only thing she knows that connects her to the world: contract killing. Shu Li Fan's victims are as mysterious to her as she is to herself. However, during one of her hits she makes a sworn enemy of a Korean killer (Han Sang Woo.) There is one small ray of hope in her grim life, and that is the beginnings of a love affair with a simple and sweet-natured noodle vendor Long Shek (Hong Kong actor Lau Ching Wan.)[1]
