He tells her that his name is Suraj, alias Surya, an ex-convict, who has just been released from prison. As he had no money, he as unable to eat anything, and hence had broken into their house to steal money and jewelry. While on the run, they are also joined by Hero, who had attempted to rob a bank so that he could go to Bombay and become a movie star. His attempt at robbing the bank had failed and he is now on the run from the police. When Dinkar is told that Reema has run away, he contacts a local gangster named Lala and asks him to locate her. Lala, in his turn asks Ranga, one of his hoodlums, to find Reema. Ranga finds out where Reema, Hero and Suraj are holed up. At the same time, Inspector Naik also finds out their whereabouts.
