Broken Journey

In postwar Europe, while flying over the Swiss Alps, a Fox Airways Douglas DC-3 airliner experiences engine trouble and sends out a distress call. Pilot Captain Fox (Guy Rolfe) and co-pilot Bill Haverton (James Donald) set the aircraft down on a glacier with a minimum of damage, but know that they will not be able to radio for help with run-down batteries and a storm setting in.
Taking stock of their situation, Haverton knows he can rely on stewardess Mary Johnstone (Phyllis Calvert), who is in love with him, but the rest of the survivors present problems. Film star Joanna Dane (Margot Grahame), opera tenor Perami (Francis L. Sullivan) and iron lung patient John Barber (Grey Blake) are all, in different ways, difficult and demanding passengers. The wrecked aircraft provides them with shelter, as the 13 passengers and crew wait for rescue.
Rescue missions have already been mounted, but when a rescue aircraft misjudges its approach, it crashes and all aboard are killed in a fiery explosion. With limited food supplies, the survivors realise that a rescue in the desolate location is unlikely. A decision to stay and wait for help or leave the shelter of the wrecked airliner to set out in bad weather to try to reach safety, paralyses the survivors. In the end, some people make sacrifices to allow others to live.[3]
