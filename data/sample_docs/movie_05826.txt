City of Bad Men

A heavyweight championship fight between James J. Corbett and Bob Fitzsimmons is coming to Carson City, Nevada at exactly the same time outlaw Brett Stanton and brother Gar return to town.
Away for six years, Brett has alienated his former love, Linda Culligan, who is now involved with Jim London, the fight's promoter. London's sister, Cynthia Castle, tries to attract Brett's interest, but he's only got eyes for Linda.
Because the bout could sell as much as $100,000 in tickets, law-breakers like Johnny Ringo are also milling around, keeping Sheriff Bill Gifford on his toes. He ends up asking Brett to be a deputy, just for the week of the fight, not knowing Brett's actually scheming to rob the proceeds himself.
A fight-day decision by Linda to end her engagement to Jim changes the plans of Brett, who decides to go straight. Alas, his brother Gar betrays him to Ringo, who goes through with the daring robbery. Brett has to exchange gunfire with both Ringo and Gar, and when he's successful, Linda returns to his arms.
