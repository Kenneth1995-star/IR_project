Nikki Singh (Akshay Oberoi) is a boxer and the wayward son of real estate tycoon Kehri Singh (Pankaj Tripathi), who is often sidelined in favour of his sister Preet (Ragini Khanna) whom Kehri considers his lucky charm. Kehri shrewdly runs Preet Real Estate business successfully in his daughter's name. Resentment against his sister causes Nikki to accumulate a large debt and subsequently in a desperate attempt to clear it he sets a chain of events which causes long buried family secrets to get exposed and brings danger to his and Preet's life.
