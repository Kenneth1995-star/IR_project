A Matter of Murder

Mild mannered bank clerk Geoffrey Dent (John Barry) is persuaded by his nagging, gold digging girlfriend Laura (Sonya O'Sheato) to embezzle money. When an attempt is made on Laura's life, Geoffrey runs away with the cash to avoid being blamed. With the killer and a detective hot on his heels, Geoffrey hides out in a remote boarding house, where he becomes the murderer's next intended victim.
