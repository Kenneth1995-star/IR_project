Cry Woman

Wang Guixiang (Liao Qin) and her husband (Li Longjun) are a migrant couple living in Beijing. Wang is eking out a career selling unlicensed DVDs when disaster strikes and police confiscate her DVD stocks, and her husband is arrested after getting into a fight over a mahjong game. Forced to return to Guizhou, she meets an old boyfriend (Wei Xingkun), who suggests she take a job as a professional mourner. Surprisingly, Wang finds herself very good at her new job as a "cry woman" and soon discovers that her talents are very much in demand.
