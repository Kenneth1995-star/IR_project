Coffee with D

Arnab Ghosh (Sunil Grover) is Senior Editor and news anchor at NB news channel. He hosts a prime-time show, interviewing different people including politicians. Due to low ratings, his boss, Roy (Rajesh Sharma), transfers him to a cookery show and asks him to come up with a new idea for another show.
Parul (Anjana Sukhani), Arnab's wife, suggests he interviews feared Don/crime boss, D (Zakir Hussain). Arbab and his colleagues shoot fake videos about D, and post them on social media in order to make D angry. He agrees to stop posting the videos after receiving a call from Girdhari (Pankaj Tripathi), D's CEO, on the condition that D consents to be interviewed. D agrees, while planning to kill Arnab live, during the TV show.
Arnab and his colleagues are brought to a secret location in Karachi by D's men, while two other gangsters arrive at Arnab's home in order to hold his family hostage. Arnab starts the interview, however D does not answer any of the questions correctly. Arnab receives a call from his wife, who asks him not to be a coward, but to prove D wrong. In the last part of the interview, Arnab accuses D of being responsible for terrorist activities, calling him a fraud and not a Don. On hearing this D dies of a heart attack.
Later, at his home, Arnab receives a call from a David Adrees Kaleman, who reveals himself to be D. A flashback shows that D only pretended to die, so that he could leave his original identity and begin a new life. Arnab is happy that there is no longer any persona such as D left in the world.
