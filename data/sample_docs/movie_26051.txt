Jungle

Anu Malhotra and Siddharth Mishra (Sidhu) are in love with each other and would like to get married. Anu is ready to inform her parents about her future life-partner, but everything is put on hold, as the family decides to go out on a group safari-like expedition. Siddharth decides to go incognito also. The group gets to view wildlife from fairly close distances. Tragedy strikes when the group (except Sidhu) is kidnapped by the Bandit Durga Narayan Choudhary and his gang. The bandits commit atrocities on the kidnapped people and finally behead one of the women in order to terrorize the government and extract ransom as well as release of one of their men who is in police custody. Once their demands are met, the bandits release remaining hostages, except Anu, whom the chief Durga Narayan Choudhary has started liking. This is unacceptable by his girlfriend Bali, the only female bandit of the gang. When Sidhu not find Anu among the released hostages, he sends the illegal arms supplier Dorai to request Durga Narayan Choudhary for Anu's release. He secretly follows Dorai and finally reaches Anu. In the ensuing commotion, he is able to run away with her, with the bandits in their pursuit. They keep searching their way out of the dense forest. Meanwhile, the goons started to reduce in numbers as they get shot one by one during repeated police encounters. Finally, Durga is the only one left. Still mad about Anu, he searches for her. He is about to take Anu away once more but is intercepted by Commander Shivraj, whom he eventually murders, but finally Sidhu kills Durga and re-unites with Anu and the movie ends on a happy note.
