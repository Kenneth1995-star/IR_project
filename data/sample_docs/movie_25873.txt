Tu Chor Main Sipahi

Raja (Saif Ali Khan) is a notorious criminal mainly robbing well to do people. Amar (Akshay Kumar) is a macho police officer tracking him and willing to do anything to catch him. Roles are reversed when Amar loses his memory and ends up in a remote village where Raja is posing as a police officer. They both team up to help the villagers from a ruthless man, Thakur Gajendar Singh (Amrish Puri).
