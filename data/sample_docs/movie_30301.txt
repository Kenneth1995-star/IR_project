Parthiban plays Ayya, a respected man who runs a cinema theatre. The story begins when bombs are placed inside the theatre during a movie. Surya and Rattan play police officers who want to defuse the bombs without letting the audience know. Vikram plays a man inside the theatre, and Suvalakshmi the woman outside who loves him.
Ayya's ex-wife (played by Jayanti) does not help when she makes a tear-filled request to him to evacuate the theatre, against the police's advice. By the time Ayya makes a decision, however, Suvalakshmi has snuck in and warned Vikram; others, hearing her words, begin to run out of the theatre. Panic ensues as everyone makes a mad dash for the door.
Ayya helps the audience to get out of the theatre without caring for his own life. Finally when everyone is evacuated, Ayya also comes out of the theatre. Suddenly, the sound of a baby cry is heard inside the theatre. Ayya rushes into the theatre with the hope of saving the baby but the sound is just a scene in the movie that was actually getting played. The bomb explodes and Ayya is dead.
