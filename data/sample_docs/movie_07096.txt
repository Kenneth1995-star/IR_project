The Reluctant Debutante

When 17-year-old Jane Broadbent comes to London to live with her wealthy father Jimmy Broadbent, her stepmother Sheila feels compelled by her own social aspirations to introduce Jane to society. Jane is bored by the debutante balls she attends and the young men she is introduced to, but becomes interested in a drummer named David Parkson, who has a reputation for leading young women astray. To complicate matters, an upper class man with perfect credentials, David Fenner, relentlessly pursues Jane, even though she openly detests him.
Parkson's reputation is undeserved, but Sheila is convinced otherwise. She tries to keep him away from Jane while her garrulous friend, Mabel, schemes to secure David Fenner for her own daughter, Clarissa.
Fortunately for Jane and David, Sheila's plans fail miserably. The two young people fall in love with each other, and David Parkson proposes to Jane. He also inherits an Italian title of nobility which makes him a better "catch" than David Fenner and satisfies Sheila's concerns for Jane's social status.
