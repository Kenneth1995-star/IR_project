Kal Ki Awaz

India is plagued with kidnappings of young children from wealthy backgrounds with their abductors demanding huge ransoms or brutally killing their victims. After the retirement of Police Commissioner Hamza Sheikh, DSP Ali Haider Jaffri takes over. Shortly after this, he displays his abilities when he successfully apprehends a gang of bank robbers - albeit by jeopardizing the life of a bank customer. Then the son of the Continental Bank Chairman, Srivastav, is abducted and held for ransom. Ali comes to know about this, intervenes, but is unable to save the child, resulting in considerable criticism of mishandling this incident. Then Ali's very own world is turned upside down when his daughter, Shagufta, who is to marry Naseerudin, the son of the Home Minister, Syed Noorudin Ahmed, is abducted along with Naseerudin. The question remains - with the lives of his loved ones in jeopardy - will Ali compromise with the kidnappers?
