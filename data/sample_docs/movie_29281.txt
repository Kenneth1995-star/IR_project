Balaji falls in love with Vijaykumari to which she equally reciprocates. She meets Balaji secretly without the knowledge of both her father and brother. One day, Balaji's notorious friends commit a murder and they fled the scene using Balaji's car. At the same point of time, Balaji meets his love in a temple and promises to marry her. Meanwhile, Balaji's father plans to marry his son to one of this relative. Balaji initially discards this proposal but accepts after coming to know that he will be deprived of his father's wealth if he doesn't marry the girl arranged by his father. Vijaykumari is shocked to hear this and finally tells her relationship with Balaji to her parents. When Muthuraman visits Balaji's house to seek justice, Balaji reiterate that Vijaykumari is completely unknown to him. Vijaykumari health begins to deteriorate and despite Balaji's selfish motive, she prays for his good health. Ironically, police arrest Balaji for the murder committed by his friends and Vijaykumari testifies as an alibi. Police arrest the original murderers. A now regretful Balaji comes to marry Vijaykumari, but it's too late. Vijaykumari's health completely deteriorates and eventually dies.
