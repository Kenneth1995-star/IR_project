Thulli Ezhunthathu Kadhal

Nandini, Kishore, Mahesh, Scud, Bhakti, Jessica, Chandana and Sridhar / Sri are all friends from school. They all finish their final year exams and try their level best to kick start their careers while they face some interesting situations in life. Nandini and her senior Kishore are in love. But Nandini's father hardly understands his kid's yearning for some lost prestige. Mahesh and Scud haven't been on talking terms since years. Bhakti is a happy go lucky girl, or so it seems. Jessica, a foreign student, is trying to make it big in fashion in India, living as a guest with rich Chandana. Sridhar is in love with Chandana but doesn't want to express it to her before he settles down in life. And then there is Dakshayini, who is bent on stealing Sridhar from Chandana. The film covers the coming of age of all these friends, as they try to solve a Rubik's cube called life. It also covers a lot of issues like acid attacks on girls, suicides, misunderstandings, false prestige and so on.
