Surya (Sanjeev) is the son of a local dada (Adithya Menon), and studies at the Chengalpet Matriculation School. His mother who is separated from her criminal husband wants him to grow up as a model citizen. Unfortunately he has more of his father's genes and gets expelled for beating up a teacher.
Surya who is attached to his mother gives a promise that he will not take the path to violence again, and is admitted to the up market Lake View School in Ooty, described by its principal (Thalaivasal Vijay) as the "best school in south Asia".
Surya is looked down by his snooty seniors led by Rohit (Rohit Rathod) and his gang. The only person who stands with him is Babloo (Karthik Sabesh), and the principal's daughter Tanya (Riya Bamniyal) who has a soft corner for him.
Under extreme provocation, Surya keeps his cool as he tries to live up to his mother's expectations. However he breaks down after Babloo is murdered, and goes on a revenge spree. The film ends on a tragic note, as the message of the film is conveyed.
