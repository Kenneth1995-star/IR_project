Steve returns home and wants Pat to quit work. She believes that Townley will sign only with her, so colleague Vera Lane talks them into a wager over which one will succeed. Townley believes that Pat is unmarried and begins romancing her, upsetting burlesque performer Sugar Lee, his girlfriend.
Complications arise as Vera secretly schemes to ruin Pat's plans, helping her own advancement in the agency. Steve and Sugar end up together at a nightclub where they are spotted by Pat, who mistakenly believes her husband is cheating on her. Steve gets fed up and decides to leave town, but Sugar's able to convince Pat of the truth. The couple reunites as they leave together on the train.
