Avan Amaran

A poor woman (Kannamba) struggles to bring up her only child, a son Arul (Ramaswamy), who does odd jobs to stay afloat. An accident disables her and life becomes harsh for her. The boy has a classmate Lily (Rajasulochana), the daughter of a mill owner (Balaiah). The two fall in love and marry against the wishes of the dictatorial mill owner. The boy wins a scholarship, goes to England and returns as a barrister. He dedicates himself to the cause of the poor, struggling underpaid workers exploited by the mill owner. The mill owner creates much trouble because his daughter defied him by marrying the labour leader. Further problems arise when the workers demand bonus and better wages and go on strike. The mill owner indulges in several subterfuges by setting fire, beating up workers and in the process the labour leader dies, leaving his widow and a young child. The mill owner's daughter takes up the cause of her idealistic husband and dedicates her life to the welfare of the mill workers.
