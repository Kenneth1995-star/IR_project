JAKQ Dengeki Tai vs. Goranger

Iron Claw is the leader of a global criminal empire, known simply as "Crime". With a network of wealthy and influential sympathizers, and employing an army of faceless, leather-masked thugs and cyborg assassins, Crime seeks to become the most powerful mafia organization in the world.
To combat this threat, ISSIS, the International Science Special Investigation Squad is formed. ISSIS organizes its forces around the world to battle Crime, including Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo's ISSIS branch commander, Daisuke Kujirai, proposes a radical experiment to aid his forces in Japan. Taking the code name "Joker", he recruits four young test subjects to undergo his cyborg enhancement project â€” multi-talented athlete and Olympic Gold medalist Goro Sakurai, disgraced boxing champion Ryu Higashi, critically injured policewoman Karen Mizuki, and clinically dead and cryogenically sustained oceanographer Bunta Daichi. Surgically altered and given various bionic enhancements as well as energy manipulation powers, the four youth begin their mission to destroy Crime as a crime-busting quartet code-named J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai. Later on, Joker leaves and Sokichi Banba, a master of disguise and a cyborg, becomes their new boss, known as Big One.
