Territory management is closed. Chief engineer, the legendary Ilya Chinkov is convinced that there is gold in the Territory. He challenges the fate and for one field season it is taken to find it. Using absolute authority, Chinkov organizes searches for gold in the Territory, despite the absence of direct instructions from the leadership and the sad fate of his predecessor, whose career was destroyed due to the fact that no gold was found in the Territory.
