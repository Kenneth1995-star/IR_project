Following on from the events in the late 1950s/early 1960s of That'll Be the Day, the characters Jim Maclaine, Jeanette and J.D. have moved into the mid 1960s/early 1970s and the growing career of aspiring rock star MacLaine. MacLaine has assembled a group of musicians and formed the band the Stray Cats, he seeks out his old friend Mike to become the band’s road manager. Mike acquires a new van, accommodation and a recording session for the group. MacLaine soon becomes a massive star and is plunged into the centre of media attention. He indulges in casual sex and heavy drug use and the film documents the detrimental effects of this success on MacLaine and his relationship with his friends and colleagues. In particular, MacLaine’s long-standing friendship with manager Mike is now soured by money and success.
