Yeh Faasley

Arunima, the daughter of one of the biggest builders in town, has returned home after completing her studies. She is happy that she will now be living with her father Devinder Devilal Dua for good. Arunima lost her mother in a car accident when she was barely two.[7]
Devinder is a gregarious man who loves his daughter and wants her to live as freely as possible.
Arunima chances upon a few things from the past and it is revealed that her mother's personality was very different from what her father narrates. She then meets an old friend of her mother, Diggy and a few people from the past who tell stories that point in the direction that her mother was not happy as long as she lived.
Arunima is left in doubt about what really is the past, especially when her father does not give a conclusive answer. To top it, Arunima starts to learn about newer shades of her father that she has never seen.
Arunima is torn between love for her father and the truth. But she is even more guilty as the needle of suspicion keeps pointing towards her own father. The shadow of doubt becomes a very difficult place to live under. So Arunima sets out on a journey to find the truth about her parents' past.
