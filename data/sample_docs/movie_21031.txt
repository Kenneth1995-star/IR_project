From Time to Time

This British ghostly haunting story spanning two worlds, a century apart, is set in 1944, near the end of World War II. Tolly (Alex Etel) arrives at his grandmother's country house, Green Knowe, after his father is reported missing in action. His grandmother (Maggie Smith) is faced with selling Green Knowe for financial reasons. Tolly soon discovers he can magically travel in time mysteriously between the present and the 19th century in the old manor house, and he begins an adventure that unlocks family secrets laid buried for generations. Exciting events include a terrible fire, a tale of stolen jewels, and threats of a press gang.
