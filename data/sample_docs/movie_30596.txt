Jayam Ravi, Asin, Nadhiya Prakash Raj

For Kumaran (Jayam Ravi), life is all about his mother Mahalakshmi (Nadhiya), who separated from her husband Eeshwar (Prakash Raj), due to differences in their priorities in life. Eeshwar goes on to pursue his passion in kickboxing and becomes a world-renowned trainer based in Malaysia. On the other hand, Mahalakshmi stays in India and devotes her life to bringing up her son.
Kumaran is also passionate about kickboxing and he shares a very special relationship with his mother. In between, Kumaran falls in love with Malabar aka Mythili (Asin Thottumkal), but his life is destroyed after his mother's death. On her deathbed she tells her son to meet his father, Eeshwar, whom Kumaran had idolised all this while. Kumaran reluctantly goes to Malaysia to meet him.
Eeshwar is happily settled with a new family. Kumaran gets a job at his father's kickboxing academy, but he finds his father with another wife (Aishwarya) and a daughter. Kumaran feels betrayed and angry looking at his father living life there happily without a second thought about his son or his first wife. This causes plenty of friction between Kumaran and Eeshwar.
His father trains a boxer, Anand (Subbaraju), whom his father is sure will win the championship. Anand is Eeshwar's devotion and on many occasions he demonstrates his preference for Anand over Kumaran. This further deepens the rift between Kumaran and his father. Anand makes Eeshwar's daughter pregnant and dumps her. He turns traitor to Eeshwar and joins another team when they offer him a better contract. The rest of the story is about how Eeshwar trains Kumaran against Anand and wins the kickboxing competition, while Kumaran helps his half-sister with her love. He wins the kickboxing championship and the movie ends with Kumaran seeing a final apparition of his mother looking at him proudly and waving goodbye.
