Rubaai

Two friends Bharani (Chandran) and Babu (Kishore Ravichandran) drive a commercial mini-truck for their livelihood. Hailing from Theni, they bought the vehicle on a loan and are due for payment. Luckily, they get an order to deliver the goods to Chennai. Despite the order, they fall short of money. To bridge the difference, they accept a 'package and movers' job from Kunkumarajan (Chinni Jayanth). Kunkumarajan is a poor widower who lives with his daughter Ponni (Anandhi). While moving the belongings to the mini-truck, Bharani falls in love with Ponni. Due to unforeseen reasons, the destination house is unavailable for rent. An entire night, they wander around Chennai in search of a house to move-in; with their belongings in the mini-truck.
Meanwhile, Mani Sharma (Harish Uthaman) loots a finance and is forced to kill the security guard. As a result, the police intensifies the search for the accused. Mani Sharma dumps the looted money in the mini-truck to escape from the police checking. Somehow he misses to retrieve the bag from the truck.
Angered that they are stalled in the middle of nowhere, Babu unpacks the belongings on the road. While doing so, they stumble upon the bag loaded with cash. Shocked with joy, Kunkumarajan gets a heart-attack. The friends take him to the hospital for treatment. Ponni is left with no money, so Bharani and Babu spend the cash from the bag for his operation expenses. After he recovers, all four of them spend most of the money in purchasing properties and other stuff.
Using his wits, Mani Sharma tracks down these people. The police department have sketched Mani Sharma's face and is in the lookout for him. Can he retrieve his loot money with the police on his tail? If so, how does he retrieve the money they have already spent forms the rest of the story.
