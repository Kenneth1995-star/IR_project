Heera Panna

Heera (Dev Anand) has two passions in his life, namely photography and his love for Reema (Raakhee), an air-hostess. When Reema passes away during an airplane accident, Heera is left with his only passion in life - photography. During one of his photographic sessions with Raja Saab (Rehman), a priceless diamond is stolen by Panna (Zeenat Aman) and is hidden in Heera's car. When Heera comes to know about this theft and that he is in possession of the stolen property, he decides to turn Panna to the police but discovers to his shock that Panna is Reema's younger sister.
