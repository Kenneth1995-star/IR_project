Jeeva (Murali) is an angry young who works as an auto-driver. During his childhood, Jeeva could not go to school because of his father, who forced him to work at a very young age, thus he suffers from an inferiority complex. Every time he sees a child working, Jeeva feels angry and he then forces the kid to go to school at any cost. Unlike Jeeva, his childhood friend Ilavenil (Anandaraj) pursued an education and he is now a conscientious police officer.
Periyanayagam (Gnanavel) is a company owner employing child labour and he is involved in some kind of illegal business. Periyanayagam has the support of the Minister (Manivannan) who helps him when he is in trouble with the police, which irks the police officer Ilavenil.
Sanjeevi Raman (S. Ramadoss) is a doctor and a political crusader who fights against child labour since many years and he filed a lawsuit against this practice. He won the lawsuit, and subsequently companies who forced kids to work are now banned by the government. Periyanayagam and the other company owners decide to kill the doctor. While planning their attack, the street dancer Selvi (Vinodhini) hears their plan and she is killed on the spot. The librarian Subha (Rohini) witnesses the murder and runs away from the murderers. In a big trouble, Jeeva comes to protect Subha from Periyanayagam's henchmen. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
