Raj Goyal (Akshaye Khanna), a young and successful criminal lawyer, famous for never having lost a case, is introduced to popular singer Sargam (Urmila Matondkar) by music magnate Ashwin Mehta (Vijayendra Ghatge). The following day, Ashwin is brutally murdered in his own house. The murderer, Tarang Bharadwaj (Ajay Devgn), who is Sargam's childhood friend and current mentor, is caught red-handed at the crime scene. He claims he is innocent and Sargam, who believes in Tarang's innocence, approaches Raj to defend him, which he accepts after meeting Tarang.
Raj finds out that Tarang suffers from split personality disorder and wins Tarang's case by proving the same. Immediately after Tarang is acquitted, Raj discovers that the split personality was an act put up by Tarang. Raj wants to put Tarang in prison by re-opening the case.He chases Tarang all around Mumbai.In the climax,Tarang falls from a height and supposedly dies.The police believe it as an accident. The interesting part is that the body is never to be found because Tarang falls in the water. The movie ends in a very suspenseful manner; whether Tarang is alive or not is left to the audience's interpretation as Sargam and Raj are on vacation and hear someone singing a very famous song produced by Tarang himself before his death. Either it's a normal person or it's Tarang himself.
