Josephine and Men

Josephine's (Glynis Johns) story is told in flashback by her suave bachelor uncle (Jack Buchanan). We hear how she rejects her wealthy fianc√© Alan (Donald Sinden) for his friend David (Peter Finch), an unsuccessful playwright. But when their situations are reversed, Josephine's interest in David starts to wane. She is a woman we hear, always drawn to underdogs.
