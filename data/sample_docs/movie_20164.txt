Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World

An Old English Sheepdog accidentally drinks a liquid growth formula (a form of experimental fertilizer) and expands to gigantic proportions. Two criminals steal Digby and sell him to a circus. Digby later escapes and roams across the countryside of the United Kingdom. The boy who owns Digby, as well as the scientist who worked on the growth formula, both realize that Digby is still growing and will cause enormous damage unless something is done immediately. The scientist finds out he has created a chemical that might reverse the growth formula. The British military, however, aims to solve the problem of the oversized sheepdog in their own way: by use of bombs and artillery.
