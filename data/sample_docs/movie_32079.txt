Moodu Mukkalata

Shanti Swaroop (Jagapati Babu) is a handsome college lecturer. Shravani (Soundarya) is a librarian in the same college. Lahari (Rambha) and Aliveni (Raasi) are the students studying there. Three of these girls fall in love with Shanti Swaroop and he loves Shravani.
Shravani is staying with her married sister (Priya) in which her brother-in-law Paramahamsa (Prakash Raj) has incestuous tendencies and secretly dreams of marrying Shravani by hook or by crook. Shravani's sister is paralyzed. Later, it is revealed that it is Paramahamsa who slow poisoned his wife so that he can marry Shravani on that pretext.
Lahari is a pampered sister of industrialist tycoon and millionaire Yugandhar (Nassar). She misinterprets that Shanti loves her due to some incidents. When Lahari comes to know that he loves Shravani, she attempts suicide. Yugandhar, who comes to know about the incident threatens Shanti that he will kill Shanti's mother (Annapoorna) if he does not marry his sister. To avoid this, Shanti agrees to marry Lahari.
Aliveni is the only daughter of Barrela Bala Raju (Tanikella Bharani), a famous rowdy. After coming to know that Aliveni loves Shanti, he makes her perform a drama that she got pregnant because of Shanti. To avoid the suicide of Aliveni, Shanti agrees to marry her.
As Shanti has agreed to marry the three damsels and Paramahamsa, Yugandhar and Bala Raju are after his life. How he manages them and how he marries Shravani forms the crux of the story.
