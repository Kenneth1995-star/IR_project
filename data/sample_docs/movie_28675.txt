Mi Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy

Dinkar Maruti Bhonsle represents thousands of 'Marathis' who feel they have lost their identity in the cosmopolitan Mumbai. Dinkar feels Mumbai is in Maharashtra but there is no Maharashtra left in Mumbai. He always complains about the lack of respect a Marathi receives in Mumbai and feels he is victimized everywhere because he is a Marathi; little realizing that he himself has brought this situation upon himself.
In a state of sheer frustration Dinkar gets up one day cursing himself for being born a Marathi. He feels his ancestors must have committed a heinous crime for him to be born a Marathi.
These outbursts of Dinkar reach Pratapgad and the spirit of Shivaji Maharaj is aroused. Dinkar has to now face a seething Shivaji Maharaj, who is furious at him. Shivaji Maharaj fires Dinkar for his shallow thinking and tells him he has to command respect, not demand it. He blames Dinkar’s thinking for the sorry state of Marathis. "Before blaming other communities for your short comings, look within and see if you have done anything to keep the Marathi pride intact," he roars.
Dinkar realizes his mistake but does Shivaji Maharaja’s thought arouse him to rectify his mistakes? The film ends with Bhonsle gladly returning the sword at the shrine of Shivaji Maharaj.
