Calling Homicide

When one of their own is murdered by a car bomb Lt. Andy Doyle is given the case to investigate. In the young cop's notes is the name of a woman, Francine Norman, who is murdered shortly thereafter, strangled and mutilated. Doyle figures out there is a connection between the two deaths. Norman was a former actress who owned a modelling agency, which is now being run by Darlene Adams.
While investigating, Doyle comes to understand that there is no dearth of suspects, as Norman was universally hated. Doyle uncovers that the agency was being used as a front for a blackmailing racket, which evidence points to being run by Norman's love interest, Jim Haddix, the owner of a local construction company. However, all the evidence of the blackmail ring is destroyed when the modeling school is destroyed by fire, with the janitor as the main suspect.
