Kali (Makrand Deshpande) is a local ruffian who harasses students in his college. The principal Satyaprakash (Alok Nath) is helpless to stop him because Kali is the son of Dabala (played by Paresh Rawal), who is one of the biggest gangsters in town. The principal has two sons and a daughter - Vikas (Vijayendra Ghatge), Vijay (Sunil Shetty) and Pooja. Vijay is in love with Priya (Somy Ali), a colleague of his in his engineering company.
Kali rapes Pooja, and then the corrupt inspector Shirke (Deepak Shirke) puts the blame on Pooja's fianc√©e, and has him killed while in custody. This enrages Vijay and he embarks upon a bloody and violent fight to cleanse the city of ruffians like Kali, Dabala and Shirke. (Mohan Joshi) shows up in a cameo as an honest ACP.
