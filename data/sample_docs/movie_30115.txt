Karnaa

Vijay (Arjun Sarja), a carefree and frolicsome youth, is sent by his father Deenadayalan (Ravichandran) in Ooty to work and becoming a responsible businessman. There, he falls in love with the college student Anjali (Vineetha). Her brothers (Mohan Raj and Vimalraj) are dangerous criminals and they are against their love because Vijay's father is a police officer. Thereafter, Devaraj is sent to jail so his brother appoints the lawyer Karnaa (Arjun Sarja) who is disabled and a sensitive person.
Later, Karnaa falls in love with the school teacher Amudha (Ranjitha), after few quarrels between both. One day, Deenadayalan saw Karnaa at the court who looks like his son Vijay. In the past, he had twin boys, but abandoned one of the twin baby because he was disabled. Karnaa is upset when he knew the truth and is now determined to win the case in front of his father. He finally wins the case and Devaraj is released immediately. Thereafter, Deenadayalan said the truth to his wife Lakshmi who wants to bring back at all costs Karnaa at home.
Meanwhile, Vijay is arrested by the police because of Devaraj's conspiracy. Karnaa rejects his parents' request and finds outrageous to abandon a baby due to his handicap. Then, Karnaa promises to help Vijay, but he advises Vijay to escape from the jail. In the meantime, Devaraj shows his secret illegal business to Karnaa and Vijay takes some photos of his factory. Afterwards Devaraj's goons kidnap their parents, Karnaa's adopted mother and Amudha. Vijay and Karnaa finally save them and send Devaraj to jail.
