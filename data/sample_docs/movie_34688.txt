Set Me Free

Yeong-jae grew up at Isaac's Home, a group home where he was entrusted as a child by his immature and reckless father. Now a sixteen-year-old high school student, he is told that he is now too old to remain at the group home. Yeong-jae will do anything than return to his father, so to extend his stay, he lies that he wants to become a priest and enter a Catholic boarding school. In fact, Yeong-jae doesn't believe in God, having learned to rely only on himself, and even secretly steals then resells donated goods. To show his religious faith, he attends mass regularly while fawning over the facility director and curate. Beom-tae, Yeong-jae's only friend at the home, disapproves of this insincerity, but he also understands since he himself has reached the home's maximum age. Having found nowhere else to go, Yeong-jae gets so desperate to stay that in the face of the director's growing suspicion of him, Yeong-jae turns his back on Beom-tae. Then one day, his father visits the group home, this time to leave his younger brother Min-jae there, and Yeong-jae's rage and despair reaches its breaking point.
