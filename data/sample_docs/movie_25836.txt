Dastak

Dastak is the story of a mentally unstable genius (Sharad Kapoor) and his obsession for Miss Universe (Sushmita Sen). Sharad is so obsessed with Sushmita that he starts killing her near and dear ones in order to get to her. Eventually, he kidnaps Sushmita and takes her to a distant isolated island in the Seychelles. There, he makes her life miserable. Sushmita tries every trick to get out of this hell. But ultimately, everything falls apart. Sushmita tries to reform Sharad by telling him that he should face his problems rather than inflicting the same physical and mental pain (that he went through in his childhood) on other people. But Sharad refuses to listen and amend his ways. In the climax, he tries to kill Sushmita because she does not love him. At the end, Sushmita kills Sharad in self-defense. She writes a self-help book and dedicates it to people like Sharad.
