Two Sisters

Viola, a writer with a severely deformed face, lives on an isolated island with her sister Marie. Viola spends her time in a darkened room writing, while Marie cares for her.
Uninvited, an unknown man swims to their house and walks in. Both sisters, frightened and confused, call out for each other. The man explains that he has come to see Viola Gé. He shows them both a copy of one of Viola's works. Viola walks up to the man, while covering her deformed face with her hand. She takes her hand away from her face and says to him: "this is Viola Gé."[4] The man tells Viola that he's read all of her work. He approaches Viola closely who covers her face again with her hand. He moves her hand and touches her. Marie interrupts and instructs the man that it's time he leaves. Marie then asks Viola to hand her her cup. The man goes to grab the cup for Marie, but cuts himself on the glass. As Marie cleans, the man asks Viola to write something for him. The man takes Viola's hand to leave with him. Marie tries to convince Viola not to leave the house, but she leaves regardless.
As Viola and the man stand outside, Viola writes (in French) "à un étranger qui me regarde en plein soleil,"[4] in his book. The man thanks her and leaves.
Viola returns to the house and sees that Marie is crying. Marie wipes away her tears and goes to close the door, but Viola instructs her to leave the door open. Marie warns that there are sharks outside, but Viola replies by saying how lucky she is to have her sister. Marie says the same to Viola. Viola goes back to writing, while Marie places her rocking chair in front of the door, hums a tune, and holds the key in her hands.
