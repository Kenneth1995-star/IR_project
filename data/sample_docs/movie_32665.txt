Avunu 2

Avunu part 2 starts with the ending frame of Avunu. With the past behind them Mohini and Harsha decide to move from the suburbs and settle into a plush apartment in the heart of the city. Having left the spirit of Captain Raju in the suburbs and armed with a talisman around her neck, Mohini starts feeling safe in the new set up. Harsha and Mohini look forward to the long pending consummation of their marriage.
But unknown to them, Captain Raju had moved in with them and was lurking around waiting for the first available opportunity to copulate with her as she's a virgin. Captain Raju makes attempts to get close to Mohini but the talisman around her neck thwarts him. He then makes plans to make Mohini remove the talisman from around her neck so that he could possess a nearby man and rape her. But providential happenings save Mohini and keep the talisman around her neck.
One day as Captain Rajuâ€™s luck would have it, the talisman comes loose and Mohini removes it for a brief period of time to find a pin to secure it. That little window of opportunity is enough for Captain Raju to create mayhem. In the final act Captain Raju plays a game of cat and mouse with Harsha and Mohini and other characters to achieve his goal of deflowering Mohini before the stroke of midnight.
