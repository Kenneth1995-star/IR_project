Poovarasan

Ukrapandi (Vijayakumar) ordered to Govind (Goundamani) to kill his baby to save his wife's life after consulting an astrologer. Govind give the baby to Sudalai (Chandrasekhar) and ordered to kill him. 25 years later, Poovarasan (Karthik) was recruited by Govind to work. Poovarasan and Kaveri (Rachana Banerjee) fell in love each others. One day, Poovarasan saved Senadhipathy (Radha Ravi).
Sinrasu, Senadhipathy son and Sundari, Ukrapandi's daughter were in love. Their parents agree for the marriage. Before the marriage, Senadhipathy reminds to Ukrapandi his stinging humiliation and orders Ukrapandi to do the same thing. He refuses so the marriage are cancelled.
While Senadhipathy's son was getting married, Poovarasan stopped it and he took him to marry Sundari. The village's chiefs decided to exonerate the new married couple and to teach a lesson to Poovarasan. Poovarasan must go through "bhoomi pujai".
An old man, pretending to be Poovarasan's father, is recognised by Govind. Sudalai didn't kill the baby and the baby was in fact Poovarasan. Senadhipathy wanted to revenge and sent henchmen to kill Ukrapandi's family. Finally, Poovarasan saved them but died by a gunshot.
