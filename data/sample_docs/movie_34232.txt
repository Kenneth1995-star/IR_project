I Won't Come Back

Anya is a graduate student who is implicated in a drugs bust after a visit from an old friend and runs from the police sent to arrest her. Due to her youthful looks, she poses as a homeless teenager and allows herself to be taken to an orphanage. Here, she meets Kristina, a 12-year old street-smart but troubled girl. When Anya runs away from the orphanage, Kristina follows her and talks her into traveling to her grandmotherâ€™s village in Kazakhstan. Along the way, Anya gradually assumes responsibility for the younger girl. [3]
