Funny Cow

‘Funny Cow’ charts the rise to stardom of a female comedian through the 1970s and 1980s. It is set against the backdrop of working men’s clubs and the stand-up comedy circuit of the North of England.
From her troubled childhood to her turbulent adult relationships, the Funny Cow uses the raw material of her life experiences to bring her unique style of comedy to the stage. A stand-up comedienne in an all-male world, ‘Funny Cow’ delivers tragedy and comedy in equal measure.
Maxine Peake plays the role of Funny Cow with Tony Pitts as her violent soul mate Bob, Paddy Considine acts as her middle class lover Angus, and Stephen Graham plays her father, as well as her brother Mike.
