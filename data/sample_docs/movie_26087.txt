Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya

City-based Ashok, who works as a Salesman in a Toy Store, has always dreamed of marrying village-based Ashoo. He is a close friend with his co-worker, Amjad, whose marriage is being finalized with Shabnam. Ashok goes to the village to meet and get Ashoo to marry him but finds she has been abducted by his brother, Bhagat, who had earlier killed her brother, Bhagwan. Ashok manages to rescue her, and they flee Bhagat and his goons in order to try and reach Amjad's wedding ceremony. Amjad is ready to even postpone the wedding in order to give Ashok enough time to make it - but nothing will prepare him for the shock when he gets the news that the train Ashok and Ashoo were traveling in had met with an accident - with very few survivors. Later, Amjad finds Ashok but Ashoo dies. Coincidentally, Shabnam looks exactly like Ashoo and he asks Shabnam to pretend to be Ashoo, only so that his friend could recover and be healthy again. Shabnam reluctantly agrees but Ashok, who is unaware of Ashoo's death, is frustrated to see that Ashoo no longer loves him like before and retreats back even when he holds her hand. Will he realise Amjad's love for him and will Shabnam ever gain her husband's love .
