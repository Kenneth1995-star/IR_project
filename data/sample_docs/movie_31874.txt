Swayam Krushi

Sambayya (Chiranjeevi) is a cobbler who raises his dead sister's son Chinna (Arjun/Sirish) while also financing the education of the orphaned Sarada (Sumalatha). He also nurses a love crush and intends to marry her someday.
In a turn of events, Sarada marries Bhaskar (Sarvadaman Banerjee) and Ganga (Vijayashanti) who has also nursed a love towards Sambayya, has a tubectomy in order to marry Sambayya. She does it so that she would be a completely dedicated mother to Chinna. After initial struggles, Ganga and Sambayya own a shoe business and become wealthy.
Chinna's biological father Govind (Charan Raj) who is a criminal returns from prison and teams up with Ganga's father (a no-good father, role with villain shades) to make a series of demands on Sambayya and to claim Chinna's guardianship.
Eventually, Chinna rebels against his father and both he and Sambayya return to latter's modest original profession of cobbler.
