Pandian (Jaishankar) is a wealthy man in his village and the village chief, he built a school in the past. His daughter Deivanai (Ranjitha) is a joyful woman, she has more power than the school headmaster and all the teachers works under her commands.
The villagers follow very orthodox customs : only those from the village can get married together and the village women are not allowed to leave the village.
Ramesh (Ramesh Aravind) is a music teacher, he comes from the city to teach music lessons at Pandian's school. At first, when taking classes, the students tease Ramesh and they don't respect him. Ramesh slowly makes them like music. Ramesh gets into fight with Deivanai, which leads to an ego clash between the pair. The hatred turns into love, they both fall in love secretly. In the meantime, Pechimuthu (Ravikanth), Pandian's nephew, is back from jail after an honour killing.
In the past, the village girl Karpagam (Raghavi) and Vetri (Vetri Vigneshwar) who was from another village fell in love with each other. When their relationship had come into the limelight, Pandian punished Karpagam : being stripped in front of the villagers. But her lover tried to save her from this humiliation, and Pechimuthu brutally killed him. Afterwards, Karpagam became mentally ill and Pechimuthu was sent to jail.
Maarappan (Raveendran), Karpagam's brother, wants to take revenge on Pandian and Pechimuthu and he waits for the right opportunity. One day, Maarappan comes to know about Ramesh and Deivanai's love. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
