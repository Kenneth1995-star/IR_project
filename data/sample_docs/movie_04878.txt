The Doctor and the Girl

Michael Corday comes from a family of physicians, and upon completing his own medical degree, he moves back to New York City and starts an internship at Bellevue Hospital.
Back in the city, Michael starts criticizing his sister Mariette's fiancé George Esmond of marrying because he wants to be part of their distinguished and renowned family. At the hospital he is criticized himself for poor performance by his older and more experienced colleague, Dr. Granville, in the E.R.
After a string of malicious rumors about Michael start circulating around the hospital, he decides that he will have to make an effort, so he takes extra good care of a patient by the name of Evelyn, who is a young poor woman working in a candy store. Before long Michael falls in love with Evelyn, much to his father's dismay.
Fabienne, who is Michael's youngest sister, leaves the family home to live alone in the Greenwich Village. To save the family reputation, Michael's father gets his friend and fellow doctor, Frank, to pay Evelyn a sum of money to stay away from Michael. When Michael learns of the money, he starts roaming the streets in a desperate search for Evelyn. He finds her in the candy store and decides to take care of her until she has recovered enough to marry him. Together they open up a medical practice in a poorer neighborhood on Third Avenue.
Misfortune lands on the family and Michael's father falls ill. Mariette puts her wedding plans on hold to nurse her father. One night Fabienne turns up at Michael's doorstep, sick after having an illegal abortion. She has lost too much blood and dies shortly after. Michael slowly changes his ways when treating the poor people at his practice. With Evelyn by his side, he develops a great deal of empathy and decides to continue with his work at the practice instead of pursuing a more profitable medical career.[2]
