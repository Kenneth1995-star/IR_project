YuYu Hakusho: Bonds of Fire

While vacationing, Koenma is kidnapped by a pair of demons known as Koashura and Garuga, who demand the possession of Lord Enma's coveted "Golden Seal". Botan finds Yusuke Urameshi and Kazuma Kuwabara on their summer vacation as well, and asks for their assistance in Koenma's rescue.
According to Martin Ouelette of Protoculture Addicts, the movie did little to satisfy fans of the YuYu Hakusho series during its original release due to its short running time.[8] Reviewing the Funimation release, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network gave the subtitled version a "B+," the English dub a straight "B," and called the story disposable stating the film is more focused on "having fun with its theatrical budget."[9]
