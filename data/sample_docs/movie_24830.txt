While in Germany, gorgeous looking Rita, who belongs to a gang of thieves, cons a jeweler into parting with a very expensive necklace, and is on the run from the police. She hitches a ride from ace Grand Prix racer, Ram Khanna, and plants the necklace on his person. He later graciously returns the necklace to her, and she in turns it in to her gang-leader. When the gang-leader has the necklace appraised it turns out to be a fake, and Rita is now on the run from her own gang. She again takes shelter with Ram, tells him the truth and that her real name is Meena. Ram wins the Grand Prix, and both return to India. Upon their entry at the airport, they are searched, and Ram is found to be in possession of diamonds hidden in medicinal capsules. He is immediately arrested, tried in Court, and sentenced to several years in prison. Years later he is released, and finds Meena awaiting. Both get married and decide to settle down and live life honestly. But trouble comes knocking on their door again - this time it's Ram's brother, Harnam, who wants Ram to join him in smuggling. Ram initially refuses, but when Meena is abducted, he relents and joins his brother in a career of crime - a change that will have disastrous results for Meena and himself.
