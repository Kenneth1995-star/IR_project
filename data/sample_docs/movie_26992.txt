They tag along his journey to Mumbai as he is unable to repay money he owes on his store. With no contacts and addresses, except that of his friend, Omkar, Deepak takes extreme measures when stepping to Mumbai while searching for him.
He is easily tricked by two con-men who sold him a Flat for 10,000 RS, only to find out while searching them for the documents. With no details on them, the Mumbai police refuse to file an F.I.R. His wife meets an escort working at a night bar who provides them an unconstructed flat for time being and convinces her to be a bar dancer till Deepak becomes stable.
Deepak gets hired as driver for a security bureau with a monthly pay of 15,000 Rs. Deepak's senior realizes that he is far too innocent and does various favours for him in order to gain his trust to loot the security agency. Deepak is extremely against the theft when the senior first mentions it. Then the senior blackmails him saying that a previously stolen box is currently kept in Deepak's house. Feeling cornered, Deepak agrees to the risky plan of stealing the keys for this box when suddenly they are both robbed again and the senior is killed. Meanwhile, Rakhi loses her job tragically. Deepak finds the box stolen by his senior in his house and comes up with a plan to ensure Rakhi and Mahi's safe return to their village.
The movie ends when his attempt to steal the keys from the agency cost him his life but through a shrewd tactic he is able to pass on Rakhi the key for the stolen box. Rakhi and Mahi return to the village with Rakhi lost in memory of Deepak and their happy past.
