Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills

Clare Lipkin is a recent widow, dealing with everything from house guest Lisabeth, to Lisabeth's libidinous ex, Howard, to family problems. She is also being haunted by the ghost of her recently deceased husband, Sidney.
Lisabeth's houseboy Juan and Clare's chauffeur Frank make a bet on which of them can seduce the other's employer first. The bisexual Frank puts up cash for the wager but if he wins he wants Juan to sleep with him. Juan wins the bet but claims that he lost and has sex with Frank anyway.
