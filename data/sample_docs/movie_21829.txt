The Dame in Colour (La Dame en couleurs)

La Dame en couleurs is set in an insane asylum administered by nuns. Into this harsh place is dumped a truckload of children who soon find an entrance to a long-forgotten underground passage beneath the hospital. There, free from the strict control of the nuns, the children can let their imaginations run free, creating a mystical world of primitive mysteries and cult-like rites.
