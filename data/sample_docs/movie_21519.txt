Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II

The game takes place approximately six months after the events of the first game,[10] and a year before the first Star Wars.[11][12] The Force Unleashed II is described as the "dark entry" in the series,[12] and a more personal story for the game's protagonist than the first game.[10]
Players control Starkiller's renegade clone, a failure of Darth Vader's attempt to create a perfect secret apprentice.[3] After a vision that Darth Vader will kill him due to his inability to kill a test droid, which had taken the form of Juno Eclipse, the original Starkiller's love interest, the clone escapes from captivity on Kamino. After eliminating his stormtrooper captors, Starkiller embarks on a quest to understand his identity and to find Juno Eclipse.[3][12] Meanwhile, Darth Vader has hired Boba Fett to track down Juno Eclipse to lure Starkiller out of hiding.[6] Starkiller rescues Jedi Master Rahm Kota, the original Starkiller's Jedi mentor, from a gladiatorial arena on Cato Neimoidia, and encounters Yoda on Dagobah.[13] After encountering strange visions on Dagobah, Starkiller rushes to Juno's ship, the Rebel cruiser Salvation, only to arrive just as Boba Fett captures her and takes her to Kamino.
With help from Kota, the Rebels launch an all-out assault on Kamino. Starkiller crashes Salvation into the planet's shield, allowing Kota to stage a ground assault, while he goes after Juno. In a confrontation with Vader, Juno is thrown out of a window, crashing to the ground. Thinking Juno is dead, an enraged Starkiller attacks Vader, severing his hand and subduing him with Force Lightning. Kota arrives with his men, and tells Starkiller not to kill Vader. He wants to interrogate the Sith Lord for the Empire's secrets, then put him on trial, and then later execute him. As in the first game, this allows the player to choose either the light path or the dark path:
