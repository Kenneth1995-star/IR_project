Swarnamukhi

Shakila Chechi (Fathima Babu) is full of gratitude when Varadarajan (Manivannan), a scheming politician, generously helps her daughter Swarnamukhi (Devayani), perform her arangetram in a local temple, but she does not know the man she is being grateful to, and is forced to become his mistress to safeguard her daughter’s future.
Akash (Prakash Raj), a Voltas representative, falls in love with Swarnamukhi and proposes marriage. She tries to keep him at arm’s length by revealing her love affair with Pandian (Parthiban), who had left her at the altar. When Akash is still willing, they decide to get married but then Pandian turns up. In the end, however, Swarnamukhi is triumphant.
