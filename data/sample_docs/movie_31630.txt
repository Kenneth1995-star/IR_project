Ranga Rao) becoming king of Prajapathis, all gods gives him most effective powers and an oath that no one will cross his words, he is blessed with 2 sons and adopted 27 girls, after that the Adi Parashakti was born as his daughter in the form of Sathi (Devika) who is the greatest devote of Lord Shiva (N. T. Rama Rao). Daksha performs his 27 daughters marriage with Chandra (Rama Krishna), after the marriage, Chandra spends his quality time only with Rohini (Rajasri) and ignores others. Knowing this Daksha cursed Chandra to die of disease TB. Chandra prays to Lord Shiva and gets a boon that he will protect him, there arises the clashes between Shiva & Daksha and war arises between them where Lord Vishnu appears and makes a compromise by making Chandra into two parts. From that time Daska maintains his grudge on Lord Shiva, when he comes to know his daughter Sathi is in love with Shiva he sees another alliance for his daughter.
But Sathi marries Shiva against her fatherâ€™s wish. Daksha attempted to insult Shiva by performing a sacrifice and omitting to invite Shiva. Sathi wanted very much to attend the sacrifice. Ignoring the advice of her husband, she went uninvited to the sacrifice, where she had to endure many insults. At last, when Daksha started insulting her husband, she could not bear it any longer and immolated herself in the sacrificial fire. When Shiva heard of his wife's death, he makes a ferocious dance called Rudra Thandava and wakes up Veerabhadra from his hair who attacks the guests at sacrifice and ended up by decapitating Daksha. At last, on request of Daksha's wife Vairini (Kannamba) Shiva forgives Daksha and brought him back to life giving him goat's head instead of his own.
