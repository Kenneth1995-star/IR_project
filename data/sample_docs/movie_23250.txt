Bloody Brotherhood

The Cheung brothers Ka-wai (David Lam) and Ka-wah (Andy Lau) are entering Hong Kong illegally. Ka-wai is caught and deported back to mainland China while Ka-wah jumps into the sea and successfully sneaks into Hong Kong after he is rescued by a boat girl, Kin (Irene Wan), and her grandfather .
After Ka-wah enters Hong Kong, his courage and fighting skills are recognized by triad leader Tong Fai (Michael Chan), whom takes Ka-wah under his wing. Later, Ka-wah and Tong are framed by rival triad leader Ma Kok-hoi (Shum Wai) and Tong is imprisoned while Wah flees to Taiwan with Kin, whom he is now married to.
Kok-hoi later becomes the main leader of the gang and a drug trafficker and wants to expand his trafficking network to Taiwan. He sends his henchmen to negotiate with Ka-wah, who now owns a transportation company, to cooperate with them. When Ka-wah refuses, the vengeful Kok-hoi sends a killer to Taiwan to kidnap Ka-wah's daughter in order to force him to cooperate. The killer turns out to be Ka-wai. While kidnapping Ka-wah's daughter, Ka-wai accidentally suffocates her to death and feels very remorseful for what he has done.
After Ka-wah discovers that his daughter's death was caused by Kok-hoi, he returns to Hong Kong and seeks revenge. During the fight against Kok-hoi and his henchmen, Fai was killed by Kok-hoi. Later Kok-hoi is stabbed to death by Ka-wai, who in turn, was gunned down by the police.
