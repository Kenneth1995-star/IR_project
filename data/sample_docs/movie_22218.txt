The Trotsky

Montreal West high school student Leon Bronstein (Jay Baruchel) believes that he is the reborn incarnation of the socialist revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Shortly after he starts to work in his family's clothing factory, he attempts to unionize the workplace with such actions as a hunger strike. He is pulled from his upper-class private school by his father (Saul Rubinek) and sent to the public school system. There, he continues his quest to live out Trotsky's activism, as he is pitted against the strong-willed principal Mr. Berkhoff (Colm Feore). Meanwhile, he seeks romance with older McGill University graduate student Alexandra (Emily Hampshire).[2][3]
