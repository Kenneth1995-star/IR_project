Blast of Silence

Frankie Bono, a hitman from Cleveland, comes to New York City during Christmas week to kill a middle-management mobster, Troiano. First he follows his target to select the best possible location, and orders a gun from rat-loving dealer Big Ralph. One night, he meets a former friend from the orphanage he grew up in, rattling his cool and putting his life in danger.
