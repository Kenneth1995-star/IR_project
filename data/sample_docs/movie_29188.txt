Kaveri and Ekambaram got together and spend time playing. Ekambaram's mother did not like it. But Ekambaram's father married Ekambaram and Kaveri while they are still children as per the custom of those times. Soon after, Ekambaram went abroad for further studies. When he returned after studies, his mother said Kaveri has died. So he married another girl. But she dies for some reason. Ekambaram comes to know that Kaveri did not really die.
Anandan is Kaveri's brother living in another village. When he heard that his sister fell in a river he is engulfed with sorrow. He gets upset and goes many places like a nomad. He joins a drama troupe. He meets a girl Vasantha and both become lovers. Anandan comes to know that Vasantha's mother is a woman of loose character. He ill treats Vasantha. But Vasantha pleads with him that she is innocent and why he should punish her for her mother's faults.
