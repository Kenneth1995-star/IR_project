Insaan

Shankar (Vinod Khanna) stays with his stepmother and three stepbrothers, but they are not very nice to him. After the death of his father, they get all the property and do not want to share it with Shankar. Later, Shankar gets married to Sona (Reena Roy) and works hard and earns money by farming. They have a child Munna (Master Sameer). His brother loses all his money in gambling and becomes poor. The stepbrothers try to kill him with the help of Sheru (Amjad Khan) so that they can take all the property that he has earned. Thinking that Shankar is dead, Sona tries to commit suicide. Ravi (Jeetendra) saves her and also protects her from her evil brothers in law. Later they get married. After some months, Shankar comes back. But he feels that he is obliged to Ravi, so he doesn't meet Sona. Later Sona comes to know that Shankar is alive and Ravi gets killed by criminals, reuniting Shankar and Sona.
