Crash Landing

Crash Landing follows the tense hours on board a stricken passenger aircraft that was on a routine flight from Shanghai to Beijing. Shortly after taking off, the pilot (Shao Bing) discovers that the plane's landing gear is unable to be retracted. Unable to continue, but unable to land, he and his flight attendant wife (Xu Fan), are forced to circle Shanghai.
Meanwhile, on the ground, a troubleshooter (You Yong) is called to see if he can get the aircraft safely back on the ground.
