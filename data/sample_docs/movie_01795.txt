Their Big Moment

Tillie Whim (ZaSu Pitts), a timid stage assistant to The Great La Salle (William Gaxton) in a small mentalist act playing a Vaudeville theater, is harassed, bullied, and undermined by the act's co-star, primadonna Lottie (Tamara Geva). When Lottie finally attempts to fire Tillie after a performance, La Salle fires Lottie instead.
The remaining troupe are then hired backstage by an audience member (Bruce Cabot) to debunk another mentalist, whom he accuses of exploiting his friend, a grief-stricken woman who has recently lost her husband in a plane crash. Tillie is promoted to Lottie's old role as medium, but unexpectedly deviates from the script when the spirit of the departed tells her that the plane crash was murder.
