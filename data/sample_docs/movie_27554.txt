The film is the narrative which emerges through five different timelines and geographies within the state of Karnataka, encapsulating the lives of four people with a common friend and their love lives while sending across a strong message relating to the common man. Four individuals, each with their own dreams and aspirations, get framed for sins they did not commit and land up in jail. They meet a school teacher who not just shows them hope but also stirs up a passion towards reform.
The story takes place in the cities of Bangalore in 1986, followed by 1995 in Mysore, 2000 in Mangalore and 2007 in Bijapur. The present day is depicted in 2017, in the Central Jail of Bellary and ends in the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha premises in Belagavi. It ends on a happy but tragic note as all five are proved innocent, but the four heroes get shot by police personnel.
