Yo-Kai Watch: Tanjō no Himitsu da Nyan!

One night, the evil Yo-kai Kin and Gin steal the Yo-kai Watch from Nate Adams to help their master Dame Dedtime prevent humans and Yo-kai from being friends! He then encounters Meganyan, who tells him that Yo-Kai are real. He and the crew head to Nate's grandmother, encounter a shadow, and chase it, but to no avail. Meganyan returns, asking to pull out the cork in his body—the cork that suppresses his energy. Nate decides not to pull it out, and asks Jibanyan & Whisper to pull it out for him, but to no avail. Nate pulls it out, and he and the crew get covered in pink smoke. He finds help from the Yo-kai Hovernyan - and uses a time stone to take Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan back in time 60 years to when the Yo-kai Watch was first invented by Nate's own grandfather Nathaniel while he was a kid. Dame Dedtime gets word of this, and tries a plan to push the human world farther from the Yo-kai world. Together, the two boys battle Dame Dedtime and her evil Wicked Yo-kai minions to save the world from her evil plans.
