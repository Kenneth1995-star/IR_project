Vasanth (Ajith Kumar) and Sathya (Prashanth) are best friends since childhood. Manivannan is working under Sathya's mother and he wants his daughter Pooja (Pooja Bhatt) to get married to Sathya so that he would be wealthy for the rest of his life. For this he makes many tricks and pranks to make them walk together alone, to go for a ride and many more. On Vasanth's birthday Sathya goes to wish him but he denies his wish and says his birthday means nothing to him anymore. Simultaneously Sathya's mother decides that her son is to marry Pooja and the engagement day arrives. Without informing her, when she enters the house as all the other guests did, Manivannan insists that she wear the engagement saree. Knowing the situation she leaves the place crying and Sathya follows her. In the middle of the street he shouts at her and asks the reason why she can't marry her.

After knowing this Sathya goes on to have a fight with Vasanth. But after knowing the truth, Sathya decides to sacrifice his love for Pooja and decides to unite Vasanth and Pooja. On a cultural day when Sathya, Vasanth and Pooja give a combined performance, the opposite gang led by Manivannan makes a vengeful plan against Vasanth and stabs him. The blame is then put on Sathya who ends up in jail. When Pooja sees her husband get hurt, she forgets everything and starts to cry for him. Then as soon as Vasanth becomes conscious, he and Pooja finally are united.
