Avittam Thirunaal Aarogya Sriman

Avittam Thirunaal Achutha Kurup(Jagathy Sreekumar) is an elderly man dependent on his children, grandchildren, and extended family. He irritates his family with his nosy nature and overeating. His family members try to avoid him, not wanting to take care of the irksome elderly man.
The family's attitudes to Achutha Kurup reverse when the news arrives that he owns a fifty-acre rubber estate.
