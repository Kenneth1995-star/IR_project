Shri Krishna Leela

Raja Kansa (Sapru) has been told by an oracle that he will be killed by the eighth male child born to his sister Devaki (Padmarani). He has Devaki and her husband Vasudeva imprisoned and kills off all the children born to them. When the eighth child, a boy, is born Vasudev manages to leave him with Nanda and Yashoda, who become his foster parents. The film shows some miracles with the ogress and serpents. It also focuses on Radha (an older married woman) and Krishna's love story. The film ends with a wrestling match between the boy Krishna and a wrestler, which Krishna wins, and his killing of Raja Kansa. Krishna frees his parents from the prison.
