Having You

A man named Jack is living with his partner Camilla but one day Anna, a one-night stand from 8 years earlier, shows up and informs him that they have a seven-year-old son called Phoenix. Jack begins to spend time with his son but is reluctant to tell Camilla about everything that has been going on. However she later finds out when Phoenix has an accident in the playground and is rushed to the hospital where Camilla works: she and Jack fall out. It is later revealed that Anna has a terminal illness and she asks Jack to care for Phoenix after she dies, which he agrees to. In the end Anna dies and Phoenix goes to live with Jack, who makes things right with Camilla. The film ends before Camilla has her baby.[1]
