Chandrolsavam

Chandrolsavam is a film that deals with a very unusual theme - a man trying to redeem his past. It's a film about a man's love for his nostalgia.
Shreehari, the protagonist, was compelled to leave his village and home after being convicted for plotting a murder, and returns home after spending a year in jail and living in Paris for many years. Back home, he tries to get back every moment of his past-his teenage romance, the sights and sounds that he had once savoured because he does not have much life left, he is afflicted with cancer.
Much of the story revolves around his childhood love Indu (Meena), and about the other two friends, one who turns out to be a husband of Indu and another one Ramanunni (Ranjith) who tried to kill her husband and tried to put the blame on Shreehari to get Indu. While Shreehari returns Indu was taking care of her bed ridden husband. After his return Shreehari proves his innocence to Indu and her husband. In an attempt to get Indu, Ramanunni kills Indu's husband. Indu comes under the shelter of Shreehari, bu she is kidnapped by Ramanunni and saved by Shreehari. Meanwhile, Doctor Durga (Kushboo) enters Shreehari home and everyone gets disappointed by her arrival as they want Indu to be united with Shreehari and Durga reveals the truth that she is running her hospital along with her husband in Delhi. And the patient (Shreehari) escaped from their hospital without their knowledge to come to his native village to see his childhood friends.
Chandrolsavam is about Shreehari's celebration of his life, love, friendships and memories. It tells the story of a man in search of his past and through it shows man's unending love for the life he has lived.
