However, when the family along with his old father is on its way home with the money, fellow villager Prakash Raj backstabs, kills all and runs away with the money leaving his wife and son behind.
Prakash Raj is head of a huge empire (with his friend Sheshu as partner) and is into all kinds of nefarious activities. Enter our hero, Kantri who flexes his muscles, shakes his leg and gets into the gang of Prakash Raj to earn money for his orphanage, where he grew up (he's orphaned at a very young age). Kantri (Jr. NTR) falls in love with Varalakshmi (Hansika Motwani) who is such a lucky girl that she wins a foreign trip, a house and household gadgets for her family.
