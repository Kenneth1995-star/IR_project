Lizette acquires four front-row tickets to the Dan Hill concert in Toronto, Ontario - one for her, one for her husband, Terry (Scott Renderer), one for Simon (Andrew Miller), and one for Simon's date. At the very last minute, Simon's date cancels and the group decides to invite Cheryl Ann to fill the seat.
Cheryl Ann becomes a memorable character not far into the film. She is eager, possesses an open attitude, and has a positive outlook on life no matter what comes at her. Her mother is dying, and she wishes to bring her to Greece for treatment from a "miracle man." Her car sometimes doesn't start and most of the time she ends up walking all the way to her job with Lizette at the donut shop. Despite the unfortunate events she is constantly victim to, Cheryl Ann sees the good in everything. [3]
Lizzette wants nothing more but to escape their small town of Stayner, (now Clearview), and everything in it, including her coworker Cheryl Ann. So when she receives the news that Cheryl Ann will be joining the group for the trip, she is anything but amused.[4] The problem is that Simon will not go on the trip without a date, and Terry will not go without Simon. Both men would rather stay in town and attend the local hockey game, however Lizette wants this trip to be a success and therefore allows Cheryl Ann to come along.[5]
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the evening does not go according to plan and the friends must examine their relationships with eachorther and others in town.
