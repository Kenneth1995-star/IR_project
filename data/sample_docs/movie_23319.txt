Touch and Go

Police officer Pitt's (Wan Yeung-ming) partner Lau was killed by the triads. The case also involves the seizure of a number of pornographic photos of politicians from an earlier investigation. The murder was witnessed by chef Fat Goose (Sammo Hung), and Pitt forces him to be the eyewitness and have the killer arrested. The killer, Lam Man-fu (Tommy Wong), however, was bailed out by his lawyer Kam Tse-ping (Lam Chung) and Pitt's superior Keung (Lau Kong) also forbids him from interfering with this case. At this time, Fat Goose's house was also torched and was determined to cooperate with Pitt to tackle the triads.
