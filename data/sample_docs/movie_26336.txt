The film, as its name implies, centers on Gurneal "Neal" Ahluwalia (Uday Chopra) and Nikita "Nikki" Bakshi (Tanisha Mukherjee), two Canadians of Punjabi descent, born and raised in British Columbia. But Neal and Nikki are different in many ways.
Before getting married Neal wants to spend 21 days on vacation with 21 women. On his way, he meets Nikki in a club, where Neal is with his date Kristi. Nikki gets drunk and starts dancing. Neal leaves his date and takes Nikki to a hotel where he watches T.V. while Nikki falls asleep. The next morning, Nikki thinks that Neal raped her when he didn't. She uses this to blackmail him all the time. Nikki interrupts his romantic meetings with other women from time to time, including once when Nikki interrupts Neal while he is having sex with another woman.
When Neal tells Nikki the truth why he is in Canada, she gets mad and dumps him. Nikki then takes Neal to a resort town Whistler promising that she will make him meet other girls there. In reality, her ex-boyfriend Trish is there with his girlfriend Amanda, and she wants to make him jealous. When Neal learns this, he doesn't agree but eventually does. They are successful in making Trish jealous. He tells Nikki that he wants her back, but she dumps him. They later spend a night together at a camp site but are unable to express their love to each other.
Neal then returns since it is time for his wedding. Later he finds out that the girl to whom he is to be engaged, Sweety (Richa Pallod), is Nikki's cousin. At the engagement ceremony just when Nikki is approaching to stop the engagement, it is revealed that Nikki's cousin had exchanged vows on the internet with her true love Happy Singh (Gaurav Gera). Sweety proceeds to run away with Happy, while Neal proposes to Nikki because they realise that they are meant for each other.
