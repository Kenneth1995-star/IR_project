Accident

Deepak (Ashok Mandanna), the spoilt son of a powerful politician Dharmadhikari (Ananth Nag) runs his imported car over pavement dwellers one fateful night under the influence of drugs. Except for a lone survivor, all are killed. Ramanna (Nagabharana), the survivor, identifies the driver. His friend Rahul (Srinivasa Prabhu), son of an advertising agency chief (Arundhati Nag), is with him during the accident. The shock of the accident leaves Rahul deeply traumatised. Unable to hold keep the secret any longer, Rahul shares the truth with his mother. She in turn implores to Dharmadhikaari to save them. Dharmadhikari who is slated to win a by-election cannot afford to let this accident ruin his political ambitions. He hushes up the case with the help of Chief Minister and sends his son on a trip abroad. Inspector Rao, (Ramesh Bhat) is the investigating officer. Ravi (Shankar Nag), a daring investigative journalist, joins him and the duo begin to putting together the evidence. With Rao’s help, Ravi gets to the bottom of the whole affair. When Rao identifies the culprits, Dharmadhikari asks his retired driver to say he was driving the car. Rao is asked to go on leave and Ravi’s editor refuses to run the story. On his way to the airport, Deepak dies in an accident. Dharmadhikari wins, but loses at the same time. Shankar Nag, apparently changed the climax. He originally wanted to work it around the assassination of Indira Gandhi
