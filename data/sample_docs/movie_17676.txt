The Craic

It's 1988 and two best friends from Ireland (Jimeoin [McKeown], Alan McKee) flee from Belfast after a violent confrontation with Colin (Robert Morgan) of the IRA and illegally enter Australia, finding seasonal work picking fruit at orchards to afford hostels, sustenance and booze costs (but so cash strapped, their whiskey and cokes are made by taking swigs of whiskey and coke, mixing the two on the fly in their mouth), the last often used to dim the two's fear of immigration officers.
After some gentle persuasion, Fergus Montague (McKeown) goes on a TV dating game show and wins a trip to Queensland. This, however, occurs just as the pair's apartment is raided by immigration officer Derek Johnson (Nicolas Bell) and Wesley Murray (McKee) is forced to escape and eventually joins his friend in Queensland. Meanwhile, Colin is sent to Australia in a witness protection program after he gives up some of his former colleagues, and (much to the skepticism of his watchers, the S.A.S.) names Fergus and Wesley as terrorists. Irritated by their lack of progress he eventually takes off to find them himself.
The two make their way up the coast and become acquainted with backpackers Alice [(Jane Hall)] and Erica (played by Catherine Arena, Jimeoin's real life wife) along the way. After their car overheats and explodes in the outback, the duo narrowly evade Colin, who has finally caught up with them. With the help of a local who calls himself Ron Barassi (Kyle Morrison) the duo make their way to a pub where immigration, the S.A.S. and a police force who discovered their burnt-out car and Colin have all arrived at. As the duo are being carted away, Colin shoots out the windows of the police car and the duo escape once more, running off into the sunset.[1]
