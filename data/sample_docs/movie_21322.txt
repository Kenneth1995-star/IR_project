Pulp

Pulp tells the story of Tony Leary, the nice-guy owner of Junk Comics, who is gearing up for one last roll of the dice. He plans to launch his new superhero title, The Sodomizer, at the British International Comic Show, and nothing will stop Tony from making it a success. Nothing except a gang of Geordie criminals who are using another comic company to launder their dirty money. Tony is drafted by the police to identify the culprits and bring them to justice. Aided by his trusty geek sidekicks, Rick and Keith, Tony must defy the odds if he is to become a real life hero.
