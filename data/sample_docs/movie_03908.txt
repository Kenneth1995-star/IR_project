Seven Days Ashore

Dan Arland is a fun-loving playboy who has been away at sea for several months. A pair of violinists in Dot Diamond's all-girl band, Carol and Lucy, have no idea that Dan's been romancing both of them. Both end up waiting for him when his ship arrives in San Francisco. His actual girlfriend, Annabelle Rogers, finds out about Dan's being on shore leave, too.
Dan begins coming up with schemes to get out of his dilemma. He persuades a couple of shipmates, Monty and Orval, to pose as millionaires and woo the two musicians. The ladies discover what he's up to and turn the tables, amusing themselves by making Dan believe he's about to be served with a breach-of-contract lawsuit. After a series of mixups, he and Annabelle decide to get married before Dan's seven days ashore are up.
