Arvind Shivashankar (Nani), who came to the city from a rural area, is a naive employee in a company. He cannot tolerate corruption, bribery, breaking rules, lavishness, and the urban culture of youth in cities. He is caught by traffic police for a minor mistake though not of his own. Although he has all documents with him, he is asked a bribe by traffic policeman. When he refuses to pay the bribe, a complaint is booked against him and he is sentenced by the court, even though he complains about the bribe.
Finally, he does a sting operation with two of his friends and 10 honest employees in various government offices by applying for identity cards like PAN card, voter card, and ration card for an anonymous person.
