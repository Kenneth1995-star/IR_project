Bhatti Vikramarka

The story is based on the historical characters of Bhatti and Vikramarka. It also shows some of the Bethala Kathalu (Stories of Vetala). Indra invites Vikramarka to Heaven and requests him to decide who is the best dancer between Rambha and Urvasi. Vikramarka gives two garlands to them to wear and dance. The garland worn by Urvasi stays fresh, whereas that one worn by Rambha withers. He judges Urvasi as the best dancer, as she is fearless about her performance and win. As a token of gratitude, Indra gifts him a Simhasanam with 32 Salabhanjikas.
Prachandudu performs 99 yagnas and in search of 100th yagna to achieve some magical powers. Mantrikudu tells him to invite Vikramarka for the sacrifice. He agrees and reaches the Smasanavatika, where he told him to get bhetala, who is hanging from a tree. He cuts the rope and gets bhetala on his back. While returning, he narrates a tricky social problem and asks Vikramarka to answer. After successfully answering all the stories, bhetala instructs him about the ill intention of Prachanda. Prachanda on his return asks Vikramarka to perform Sashtang Pranam. The cautious Vikramarka tells him as a king he does not know how to do it and requests him show how to do it. He kills Prachanda while he is on Pranam and gets the magical powers.
