Speechless

Julia Mann (Davis) and Kevin Vallick (Keaton) are insomniac writers who fall in love, but their romance is thrown for a loop because both are writing speeches for rival candidates in a New Mexico election. Julia is working for the Democratic candidate and Kevin for the Republican candidate.
Also complicating matters are Kevin's ex-wife (Bedelia), who is on the Republican's campaign trail, and "Mr. Flack Jacket," television war correspondent "Bagdad Bob" Freed (Reeve), Julia's estranged fiance, who wants her back.
