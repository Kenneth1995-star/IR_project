Parijatham

The film has three story lines. The first line which is the first part is about the well known myth of Naragasura. Naragasura, the demon king has invincible powers due to the boons he had received from Devas and with all that he wreaks havoc on everyone. Narada knows that only Bama, the wife of Krishna who was Naragasura`s mother in the previous birth can annihilate him. Narada adept in his covert ways to achieve his goals subtly gifts a parijatham flower to Krishna and make him in turn gift it to his first wife Rukmani. As expected the demon king dies at the hands of Bama but not before making a request that his day of death be celebrated by people as Deepavali. The next story line has the same parijatham that breeds enmity in Bama against Rukmani. Finally she understands that Rukmani`s devotion to Krishna far exceeds her own, a humbling experience. There is a third line which is a comic interlude that instersects the film throughout. N.S.krishnan, T.A.Mathuram and side kicks Kaka Radhakrishnan and Pulimootai Ramasamy take care of that.[3]
