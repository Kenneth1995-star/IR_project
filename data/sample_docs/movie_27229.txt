Ravi, a recent college graduate, has many opportunities to enter different fields but he goes with his father's dream of becoming an Inspector. Ramanna gets transferred into a town whose residents are troubled by the rowdy Kari Kaala (Mohan Raj). The police force in the town turns a blind eye to the acts of Kari Kaala. One day Ramanna gets information that Kari Kaala is creating trouble in the market place. Being an honest police man he goes on site to investigate where he takes him on. Hearing of trouble, Ravi too rushes to the market place. Ramanna is no match for the goon and Ravi tries to intervene before his father is killed. A fight ensues between Kari Kaala and Ravi and both are arrested by the police. Since he managed to defeat the reigning rowdy, Ravi is typecast a rowdy by the people of the town.
After recovering, Kari Kaala targets Ravi and his family. With the police failing to protect him, Ravi is forced to fight for his life and ends up killing Kari Kaala.
