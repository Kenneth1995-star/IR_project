Up the Junction

Wealthy young heiress Polly Dean (Suzy Kendall) gives up a privileged life in Chelsea and moves to a working-class community in Battersea, where she takes a job in a confectionery factory in an attempt to distance herself from her moneyed upbringing and make her own living. She becomes friends with two working-class sisters, Sylvie (Maureen Lipman) and Rube (Adrienne Posta). Rube becomes pregnant and has a traumatic illegal abortion. Tragedy then strikes when Rube's boyfriend Terry (Michael Gothard) is killed in a motorcycle accident.
Meanwhile, Polly begins a relationship with a working-class boy named Pete (Dennis Waterman). Pete envies Polly's access to an easy life, and is frustrated by her rejection of the upper-class lifestyle. Pete and Polly's relationship ends in turmoil when Pete, after stealing a car in an attempt to woo Polly, is caught and sentenced to a prison term.
