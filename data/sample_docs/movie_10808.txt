Red's Dream

Taking place on a rainy night in an unnamed city, a red unicycle named Red is lying in the clearance corner of a bicycle shop called "Eben's Bikes". Red dreams of being the center of a circus act, which is represented within a dream sequence in which he is ridden by a circus clown named Lumpy. After cycling onstage to little fanfare, Lumpy begins a juggling act with three colored balls, which he continually drops by accident, prompting the unicycle to roll out from underneath him and catch them. Eventually, Lumpy accidentally launches one of the balls out of the ring, prompting Red to go out and retrieve it without his notice. After realizing that his unicycle is out from beneath his feet, Lumpy falls from the ground, after which Red catches the other two balls and begins juggling them to an uproarious applause; however, the dream ends, and Red awakens after bowing to the audience, realizing that he is still in the bike shop. Depressed, he returns to the corner where he was previously resting and becomes inanimate again.
