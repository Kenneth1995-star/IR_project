Golmaal

Ganesh (Selva), a good-for-nothing youth, falls in love with Aishwarya (Monica Nerukkar). Her father Karnal Rajappa (Rajan P. Dev) is a very strict father who hates love. Ganesh and Aishwarya decide to elope but her father later has a heart attack and Aishwarya refuses to marry him. Karnal Rajappa's state of health deteriorates, therefore he arranges his daughter's wedding as soon as possible. Three terrorists (Sathya Prakash, Mahanadi Shankar and Bhanu Prakash) escape from jail. While preparing Aishwarya's wedding in Karnal Rajappa's house, Ganesh enters in her room and tries to convince her. In the meantime, the three terrorists enter in their house and begin to sequester them. These terrorists are ultimately Ganesh's friends and it was Ganesh's plan to marry his lover Aishwarya. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
