Mandy

Harry and Christine Garland have a deaf daughter, Mandy. As they realise their daughter's situation, the parents enroll Mandy in special education classes to try to get her to speak. They quarrel in the process and their marriage comes under strain. There are also hints of a possible affair between Christine and Dick Searle, the headmaster of the school for the deaf where Mandy is enrolled. Eventually, the training succeeds to the point where Mandy says her own name for the first time. Mandy's speech was achieved by using a balloon. She was able to feel the vibrations of sound onto the balloon and knew she had made a sound.
