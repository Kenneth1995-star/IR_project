Inuyasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler

Two hundred years ago, the suitor Takemaru kills Lady Izayoi. Inuyasha's father, injured from the battle, uses Tenseiga to resurrect Izayoi. She and her newborn son, Inuyasha, escape from the palace, where Inuyasha's father and Takemaru died.
In Tokyo, Kagome's family examines a sword and sends it to the storehouse. The sword, turning out to be So'unga (owned by Inuyasha's father), breaks the seven hundred-year spell from the spirit of the sheath, Saya. When Inuyasha touches the sword, it possess him and he brings it back to the past. He ends up using "Dragon Twister", a calamity technique. Sesshomaru, sensing So'unga's voice, discovers that InuYasha is possessed by the sword. The two of them fight each other, until Kagome helps Inuyasha resist So'unga's power and drop the sword. With the Beads of Subjugation broken, Saya explains to everyone that Inuyasha's father wielded all three swords. While the sealed one is sent to the "Bone Eater's Well", it was not used by either Inuyasha or Sesshomaru. When So'unga recovers Sesshomaru's arm, he orders the revived Takemaru to turn against the heroes. Takemaru occupies the castle and summons the undead army, but the heroes foil it. Before Takemaru dies again, he realizes he loved Izayoi. Sesshomaru uses the Tenseiga to kill the imps. So'unga creates itself a new body and opens a gateway to the netherworld, threatening to end all life on Earth. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru decide to work together. They combine their attacks with the Tenseiga and Tessaiga, causing So'unga and the arm to fall into the pit of hell. Before the soul of Inuyasha's father disappears, he thanks his sons for sealing it away again. Kagome forces Inuyasha to wear the repaired necklace again.
