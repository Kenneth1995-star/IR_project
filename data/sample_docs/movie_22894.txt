Bleeding Steel

Hospital doctors call to inform Special Agent Lin Dong (Jackie Chan) that his daughter Xixi (who suffers from leukemia) is in critical situation. He speeds over to the hospital with a teddy bear strapped into the backseat of the car. On the way, co worker Xiao Su (Erica Xia-hou) calls him to inform that a critical witness is in danger. Agent Lin stops right outside the hospital, pauses, and turns back to protect the critical witness Dr. James.
Dr. James injects himself with a chemical substance stored with a mechanical heart right before the police bursts in to escort him away. They are ambushed by man in black and almost all in the team are killed. Xixi meanwhile dies at hospital. Xiao Su manages to protect Dr. James from being killed, while Lin Dong manages to ram Andrew against an oil tank using his car and cause a huge explosion by shooting the oil tank. The car flips and the scene changes to 13 years later.
