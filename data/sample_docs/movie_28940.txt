Poompavai

Poompaavai is the daughter of Sivanesan, a jeweller based in Mylai (now Mylapore), which is ruled by a chieftain. Her stepmother despises her and plots against her. Poompaavai devotes herself to worshipping the Hindu god Shiva. One day, Shiva appears before her father in the guise of a sadhu, and gifts him a rare ruby, which he decides to embed in a crown that the chieftain has ordered him to make. To his dismay, Sivanesan realises that his daughter has given the ruby away to a sadhu seeking alms. The chieftain refuses to believe this, and banishes Sivanesan and his family. They wander all over until they meet Thirugnana Sambandhar, a saint to whom Poompaavai is attracted. However, he tells her not to indulge in such desires but instead seek divine knowledge. After learning of Sambandhar's powers, the Mylai chieftain decides to forgive the banished Sivanesan's family and reinstates them. However, Poompaavai dies after being bitten by a snake. A shocked Sivanesan rushes to Sambandhar, who prays over her and successfully resurrects her. She again requests him to marry her, but Sambandhar says that having given her life, he is now like her father. He instead gives her divine knowledge and she becomes his devotee.
