Abdul is a truck driver plagued with severe alcoholism and depression that causes him to want to end his life. One day another truck driver shows him a newspaper advertisement that offers help for suicide-ridden youth. Abdul decides to try them out and travels all the way to the countryside. Once there he is joined by four other youths, including a printing press proof-reader, Prakash Raikar; a young woman, Maya, who had been molested and hates men, as well as two other males, which include Sunil, who is gay. They meet with the person who placed the advertisement, a wheelchair-using former Indian Army Major Vishwas Sawant and his assistant, Vasu Mudaliar. The two are escaped convicts by the names of Jagga and Badri, that seek their patient's deaths.
