Saudamini

A Maharshi (sage) blesses King Vikramasenan and Queen Saudamini to beget a child. The queen becomes pregnant. But the king is lured by the court dancer and he neglects the queen. The minister advises the queen to drive away the court dancer from the country. But the court dancer sows seeds of doubt in the king's mind that the queen is having an affair with the minister. So, the king orders the minister to be executed and sends the queen to the forest. The queen delivers a son, Udhayasenan, in the forest and he is growing up. In the meantime, the court dancer and her paramour, the commander blinds the king and take over the administration. Hearing this, the queen sends her son to get his father freed and regain the Kingdom. On his way, the prince meets princess Hemavathi and they fall in love with each other. The son defeats the commander and recaptures the Kingdom. The king's eyesight is restored with the help of an angel. The family is united. [3]
