It's Great to Be Young

Mr Dingle (John Mills) seeks to interest his students in music in order to enjoy life, while the new headmaster, Mr Frome (Cecil Parker) believes Dingle is ruining the children's traditional education.
Mr Dingle's students come up with a way to raise money by playing to crowds in the street and persuade Mr Dingle to help them. When this fails they decide to jazz it up and bring in some younger kids to help which is a success so, with the help of one of the student's parents, they are able to buy new musical instruments.
However, when Mr Dingle ends up on the front page of the local newspaper, the headmaster locks the instruments up. The students manage to get them out of the locked cupboards, rehearse and put them back without anyone noticing.
Mr Dingle takes a job playing the piano in his local pub but he is spotted by one of the teachers who reports him to Mr Frome who fires him for it. The children protest Dingle being fired by leading a strike and a sit in.
Eventually, order is restored as Mr Frome relents and allows Mr Dingle to return.
