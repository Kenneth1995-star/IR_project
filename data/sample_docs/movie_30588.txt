Dhanush, Sindhu Tolani, Pasupathy

Subramani (Dhanush), known as Sullan among his friends, is the son of a corporation garbage lorry driver Mani (Manivannan). A first-year college student, his only objective in life is to have fun with his friends. He has a few unexceptional run-ins with Soori (Pasupathy), a money-lender who charges atrocious rates and then goes after those who fail to pay him back, but when Soori's actions touch his own family and friends, Sullan is forced to strike back.
