Barsaat

Badal (Bobby Deol) is a naive but intelligent young man who comes from a small village to the big city to attend college. He is introduced to city life by Damru (Harish Patel), who calls himself Danny. When Badal attends college, he meets pretty and precocious Tina Oberoi (Twinkle Khanna) and, after a few misunderstandings and misadventures, they fall in love.
This relationship is not approved of by Tina's wealthy widower step-dad Suresh Oberoi (Raj Babbar), who hopes to marry Tina with his friend's (Bharat Kapoor) son. Suresh complains to the college principal (Vijay Kashyap), that Badal has been responsible for sexually harassing a girl at the college one night, but Tina testifies in favour of Badal and insists he's innocent for the wrongdoing. Suresh then asks a corrupt cop, Negi, (Danny Denzongpa) the city's assistant commissioner of police, for assistance.
Negi arrests Badal on trumped-up charges and imprisons him. Badal's widowed dad Bhairon (Mukesh Khanna) comes to the big city to try to make sense of why Badal is in prison. Suresh gives a contract to Negi to have Badal killed. Negi agrees and hires a gang of ruthless outlaws to hunt and kill Badal. He also pressures Tina not to acknowledge and meet Badal anymore, and Tina reluctantly agrees. When she learns that he is not dead, she goes to him. In an effort to save her, Suresh dies and Badal kills Negi. At last, Tina and Badal unite with the dying Suresh, approving their match.
