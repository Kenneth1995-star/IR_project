The Shakedown

Augie Cortona, a newly released convict, opens up a photographic studio that serves as a front for pornographic and blackmail activities. He runs into trouble with a rival gangster, and bitter warfare erupts. Scotland Yard track down Cortona by employing an undercover female model to infiltrate the ex-con's set-up.[2]
