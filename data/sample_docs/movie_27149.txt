Bili Hendthi

Arathi is affianced to a guy who is visiting the United States. Being thus a de facto daughter-in-law, she assumes the role and practically lives with her in-laws. However, when her fianc√© returns, she finds out that he has married Alicia, a "white woman", and is no longer interested in her. The rest of the story mostly revolves around how Alicia wins over all and sundry with her agreeable character and willingness to meld and melt into Indian society. Arathi assumes a larger-than-life good samaritan character, which is presumably the very antithesis of a jilted lover.
