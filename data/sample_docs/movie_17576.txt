The Place at the Coast

Young Ellie McAdam's passion and shelter is the pristine landscape surrounding the village of Kilkee on the Australian east coast where she and her father Neil, an abstracted widower, spend peaceful holidays in a ramshackle beach house disrupted by visits from their obstreperous extended family. When Neil is blinded by the sudden rediscovery of love, Ellie finds herself isolated in her opposition to a development that will destroy the landscape forever.
