Mahapurush O Kapurush

Bireshwar Chatterjee (Dipankar De), a wealthy industrialist, is a very happy man. The reason for his happiness is that Shri Shri Sadgajananda Maharaj (Bratya Basu), a holy man with powers that control even the Andromeda Galaxy (boasted by Sadgajananda himself), is residing at his house. Naturally, many people from the upper strata of the society (the mayor, a tollywood actress, a writer, etc.) is coming to pay homage to the saint. Unknown to everyone, Sadgajananda is actually a con man, Gopal, who makes a living conning people, along with his partner, Aapu (Lama). In a parallel story, a thief (also Bratya Basu) breaks into a house of a family of four people, where he is accidentally killed. The family members decide to dispose off the dead body in some remote area but are constantly harassed by the police inspector (Biswanath Basu). By a series of events, the dead body lands up in Bireshwar's mansion, where meanwhile, Sadgajananda and his partner had fled with valuables, leaving Bireshwar's prestige in jeopardy.
