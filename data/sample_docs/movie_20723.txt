Onegin

In early 19th century Russia, a bored St Petersburg socialite named Onegin inherits his uncle's estate in the country. There, he meets a neighbouring landowner and poet and a widowed mother and her two daughters. The poet is engaged to the elder daughter. Her sister writes Onegin a passionate love letter but is cruelly spurned by him. His flirtatious attentions towards the poet's fianc√©e lead to a duel and the death of the poet. Onegin disappears. On his return, six years later, he encounters the woman he spurned, who is now married to a prince. Onegin begs her forgiveness for his past behaviour.[2] The film compresses the events of the novel somewhat; for example, the Naming Day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatyana. As a result, Onegin's reasons for dancing with Olga and insulting Lensky are left somewhat confusing. Much like the 1988 film version, Onegin gives the impression that, during the duel sequence, Onegin shoots to kill.
