Sweepstakes winner Joe is taken to the cleaners by con men G. Y. Prince (Milton Frome) and R. O. Broad (Bill Brauer) by investing his winnings in Consolidated Fujiyama California Smog Bags. The Stooges head to their offices to get Joe's money back. Instead, they find two sympathetic businessmen (the two crooks, in disguise) who offer to pay back the losses if Moe, Larry and Joe will pose as juvenile wards for a rich and eccentric millionaire, Montgomery M. Montgomery (Gene Roth). But Montgomery is actually Prince's and Broad's gang leader, and plotting to kill the Stooges.
