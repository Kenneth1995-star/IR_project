Beefcake

This film looks at buff and muscular men of the 1950s in magazines and the repetitive industry that was popular in the health and fitness magazines but were primarily being purchased by homosexual men and underground homosexual communities. [5] The perpetrator of the literature was Bob Mizer, who "maintained a magazine and developed sexually explicit men's films for over 40 years." By the end of the film, a court room drama scene is shot as Mizer attempting to run a male-prostitute ring in the early 60s. [5] Clips of Mizer's actual films are included in Beefcake.
