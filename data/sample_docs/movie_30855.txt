Muniyandi Vilangial Moonramandu

Muniyandi (Bharath), a third year under-graduate zoology student and the son of Muthumani (Ponvannan), who happens to be student canteen contractor of the same college. He meets Madumitha (Poorna), demure young daughter of a local bigwig, Ramaiyya who gives first priority only to the members of his caste. Madumitha makes a coquettish play for all of Muniyandi's friends including Sorimuthu Ayyanar (Vadivelu), a part-time witch-doctor also peon of the college, dressed complete with bells and saffron cloth regalia, but hits it off with him first. Following a heated skirmish in the caste-dominated college elections, the two fall in love. But everything goes topsy-turvy when, once Madumitha's marriage is arranged, she turns around and says that she was never in love with Muniyandi in the first place. Furious, the Muniyandi thrashes her with his slippers and sets fire to her father's coconut grove. Though she never reveal to this incident to anyone, Muniyandi on other hand discovers the secret behind his brothers death. Muni's brother was killed when he tries to help his friend who is in love with a girl of the other caste. Muni participates in college elections to go against Madhu's words. On the day of nomination Muni realizes that Madhu love him truly but had reverted from her feelings due to the request from his father to save his life. Muni convinces college students from conducting election in college and put a stop caste game in college. Ramaiyya and the other caste head were supposed to be killed by Raju (Muni's brothers friend and the old girl's lover), which Muni thwarts. Finally, Muni, with his father's acceptance, returns to Madhu (who was waiting for him near the temple) and unites with her.
