Tropic Zone

Reagan's character, Dan McCloud, is an American (described as a "soldier of fortune" in the publicity for the picture's release[4]) who becomes the foreman of a Central American banana plantation. Learning that his employer, Lukats, is corrupt and trying to corner the market, McCloud joins with one of the smaller growers (played by Rhonda Fleming) to organize the workers and stop Lukats' scheme.[5]
Reagan later dismissed this film as a "sand and banana" picture with a "hopeless" script.[6][7]
