Two a Penny

Jamie Hopkins (Cliff Richard), an art student and frustrated pop star lives with his mother (Dora Bryan), who works as a receptionist for Dr. Berman (Donald Bisset), a psychiatrist who is experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Jamie wants to make money quickly, and begins to work at the doctor's office as a pretence in order to steal drugs.
When his girlfriend Carol (Ann Holloway) is converted to Christianity when attending a crusade led by evangelist Billy Graham, she attempts to show him the error of his ways. Soon after, Jamie is caught stealing from Dr. Berman's drug supply, and attempting to double-cross drug dealer Alec Fitch (Geoffrey Bayldon).
Initially hostile toward his girlfriend's newfound faith, Jamie eventually accepts it.
