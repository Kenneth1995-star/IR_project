Faith, Fraud & Minimum Wage

Rebellious Casey McMullen wrestles with the true nature of miracles when her father begins to believe in a religious hoax which she has secretly created. Casey never knew what a miracle could do, until she created one. Frustrated with her life, Casey throws a cup of coffee at the wall of Krowne Donuts where she works, and the splash seems to closely resemble an image of Jesus Christ. Overnight, Casey finds herself becoming the ring-leader of a growing faith circus. Casey's father, haunted by the aftermath of a family tragedy, is letting everything around him fall apart: his mortgage payments, his business, everything. Casey's hoax might just be the revelation her Dad needs, but the result of Casey's hoax are not at all what she expected.
