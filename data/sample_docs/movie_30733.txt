Thiruvilaiyaadal Aarambam

Thirukumaran (Dhanush) is a carefree, laid-back guy who has a great time with his friends (Tiger Kumar (Karunas), Sukumar and others). He falls in love with Priya (Shriya Saran), who is the sister of Guru (Prakash Raj), a rich business tycoon. The story is about a cat-and-mouse game between Thiru and Guru, who is against Thiru and Priya's love. Thiru wins the game at the end.
