Sheetal (Namrata Shrestha) was a heart patient from birth. In order to save her and keep her last wish of life, Dr. Sharma (Sheetal's Dad) played by Amitesh Shah, illegally swaps the heart of Sheetal with Aayush (Aaryan Sigdel) who was born the same day claiming Aayush dead to his real parents. However, a nurse adopts Aayush and raises him in Dharan. After the death of the nurse, Aayush faces the truth that she is not his real mother and travels all way Kathmandu to find Dr. Sharma and reveal the truth.
Dalli (Chulthim Dolma), the one-sided lover of Aayush, follows him to Kathmandu where she assists Aayush in helping his real parents who were living in hard times and were in debt. Helping his real parents from their financial difficulty, Aayush figures out that his life is soon going to be fullstopped.
Sheetal and Aayush who had fallen for each other (unknown of their prior history) Once Aayush is known of the truth, he ignores Sheetal in any possible way. However, Sheetal couldn't get rid of her feeling and later, when she figures out the actual reason Aayush was ignoring her, Aayush is already approaching towards death .
Aayush's leaves a huge pain for both Sheetal and Dalli and whenever it rains they lose themselves in the rain in memory of their beloved Aayush.
