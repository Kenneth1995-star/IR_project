Chaahat â€“ Ek Nasha[4] tells of Mallika Arora (Manisha Koirala), a pop star, who falls in love with Rahul Kapoor (Aryan Vaid), the owner of RK Music World. He thinks of her as his best friend only. Though she is physically attracted to Rahul, she does not want to tie the knot. Rahul and Mallika have had physical relations. However, when he proposes to her, she politely turns him down, saying that she does not believe in wedlock. She is strongly of the view that the instant a couple gets married, love and attraction slip away.
The story takes a new turn with the downfall of Mallika as all of her albums are flopping and she is becoming a fading star. Rahul launches a newcomer, Rashmi Jaitly (Preeti Jhangiani) in his new music video. Rashmi's debut music video is a big hit and she becomes a star overnight. Rahul falls in love with her and Rashmi reciprocates his feelings. Rahul decides to marry her.
When this reality of Rahul's falling in love with Rashmi dawns upon Mallika, she is shattered. She gets drunk and orders her personal bodyguard Jaidev (Sharad Kapoor) to kill Rahul. However, the next morning, when her alcoholic intoxication vanishes, Mallika realizes her mistake and calls up Jaidev in order to stop him from killing Rahul.
But Jaidev, who is in one-sided love with Mallika, is all set to eliminate Rahul. A dangerous game has begun, in which Mallika wants to save her love at any cost.
