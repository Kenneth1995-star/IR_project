High Tide at Noon

A woman named Joanna returns to an island off the coast of Nova Scotia where she was raised, and where memories immediately stir from her past.
She recalls being 17 and having the attentions of three young men. The handsome but arrogant and aggressive Simon Breck repels her, while Nils Sorensen, who loves her, is seen by Joanna only as a friend, not a suitor. She ultimately marries Alec Douglas, a gentle soul who reads poetry to her.
Economic hardship overwhelms nearly everyone on the island, particularly Joanna's parents, the MacKenzies, as the fickle ocean keeps leaving the fishing community's lobster traps empty. Worse for her, Alec amasses a debt well into the hundreds of dollars to Simon, due to his gambling. All three men ultimately disappear from her life, but upon her return, many years later, Joanna is pleased to once again encounter Nils.
