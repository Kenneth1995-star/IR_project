Inside Daisy Clover

In 1936 Santa Monica, Daisy Clover is a tomboy, living with her eccentric mother Lucile, in a ramshackle trailer. Wishing to become an actress, Daisy submits a recorded song to studio owner, Raymond Swan.
Swan puts her under contract for five years. Raymond's wife, Melora, asks Daisy to deal with her job. Lucile is sent to the hospital for mental institution. Daisy meets and spends time with fellow actor, Wade Lewis. Raymond fears that the romance will interrupt Daisy's job. Wade asks Daisy to marry him and the ceremony is held at Raymond's house. During the honeymoon, Wade drives off and leaves Daisy in Arizona. When she returns to California, an extremely intoxicated Melora reveals to Daisy that she had an affair with the closet homosexual Wade. Raymond tells Daisy about Wade's orientation, as he did for Melora. Raymond and Daisy begin an affair.
Daisy sends Lucile to a beach house, but Lucile dies. Daisy suffers a nervous breakdown and spends her days at home under the care of a private nurse. Melora visits and assures Daisy that she is not jealous about Raymond. Becoming impatient with Daisy's long recovery, Raymond tells her she must finish her contract and pending film. After Raymond and the nurse leave the house, Daisy fails to commit suicide. Before leaving, she turns on the oven's gas and the kitchen stove, causing the house to explode and catch fire.
