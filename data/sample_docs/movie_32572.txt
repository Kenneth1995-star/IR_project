Jai Sriram

Sriram Srinivas (Uday Kiran) is a tough and honest cop. He values his job and fights for justice and the protection of society. His moral values and ethics bring him into direct conflict with Chintamani and his son (Aditya Menon). Chintamani is a corrupt politician who runs an illegal organ trade racket by exploiting orphans and homeless people. Our hero Sriram Srinivas decides to put an end to Chintamani’s game. He even goes against the Police Commissioner (Chalapathi Rao)’s orders. But he faces some unexpected difficulties in the form of dishonest colleagues. Sriram’s life is destroyed. His family is killed. There is nothing left for him. That is when our hero decides to take revenge. He starts hunting down Chintamani and his gang. He does not spare his corrupt colleagues as well. What happens in the end and how Sriram achieves his objectives is what ‘Jai Sriram’ is all about.
