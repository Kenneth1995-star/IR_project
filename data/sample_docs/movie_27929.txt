Kanaka Simhasanam

The movie tells the story of Kanakambaran (Jayaram), who runs a drama troupe along with his wife Bharati (Karthika). The company is operating at a loss, but the couple struggle to keep it going as their creditors are breathing down their necks.
One day, they strike gold when Udaya Varma (Janardhanan) and Ramakrishnan (Bheemnan Raghu) ask them to take part a real-life drama: they want Kanakambaran to play Suryanarayanan, the heir to the throne of the palace and childhood sweetheart of the princess Kanjanalakshmi (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy). Kanakambaran takes up the challenge and also places his wife as the cook at the royal palace; in the meantime, a bad guy Narasimhan (Kiran Raj) also has an eye for Kanjanalakshmi. After many days Kanakambaran learns that he was originally Suryanarayanan who was adopted by the palace cook. After a fight, Kanakambaran returns to drama world and Narasimhan becomes a good man. Later, Kanjanalakshmi is married to Narasimhan. The story ends with the song of the drama couples dancing.[1]
