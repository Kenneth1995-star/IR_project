916

916 focuses mainly on the relationship between a single father, Dr. Harikrishnan (Anoop Menon), and his 12th grade daughter Meera (Malavika Menon). It narrates the events of two closely knit families losing their balance; Harikrishnan's, and Dr. Ramesh's (Mukesh), his wife (Meera Vasudev) and their two children. While Dr. Harikrishnan is an altruist who considers his profession a means to serve society, Dr. Ramesh thinks otherwise. Prasanth (Asif Ali) appears as a romantic interest of Meera, leading her astray into the world of malls, cellphones, and the Internet. The movie comes to a twist when Meera goes missing. [2]
