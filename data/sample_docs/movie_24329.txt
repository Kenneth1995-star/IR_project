Prem loves a gypsy girl Dulari (who was kidnapped by gypsies in her childhood) but her father orders him not to marry her. Prem, however, disagrees and leaves the house to marry Dulari. He brings Dulari to his other house to marry. The gypsy sardar's son also wants to marry her and kidnaps her again. He also loots Dulari's real father and ties him at his backyard. Another gypsy woman Kasturi (Geeta Bali) gets to know Dulari's truth and frees her father. Prem after fighting frees Dulari again. His mother brings both back home, but his father refuses to bless them. Another gypsy, who knows Dulari's truth and has her childhood photo comes to Prem's house. They all realize, Dulari is daughter of friend of Prem's friend, another businessman. Dulari is reunited with her family.. And she and Prem get blessings of their elders.
