Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswathi

Thakur Hansraj (Amrish Puri) is a greedy man who kills his brother-in-law to fulfill his greed. Using false means, he takes the signature of his sister Bharati Devi (Nirupa Roy) on the property papers taking control of the entire property. Bharati Devi's son, Ganga (Amitabh Bachchan) takes a pledge that he will one day avenge the wrong done to his family.
Ganga becomes a truck driver who transports goods. Jamuna (Meenakshi Sheshadri) jumps on the truck one day to save herself from a goon who is after her. Ganga has to stop the truck as the road ahead is blocked. It starts raining heavily and the only place nearby is a lodge for couples on their honeymoon. Ganga who has discovered Jamuna, decides to go there to take shelter with Jamuna pretending they are a couple. The next day, when the same goon returns to take Jamuna away forcibly, Ganga fights him. Jamuna falls in deep ice and there is no fire nearby to save her life. In the process of providing Jamuna with body heat, they end up having sex.
Ganga is arrested for beating up Thakur's son and is jailed for two years. When he returns, Thakur sends his person to kill him. A blast takes place at the bridge and Jamuna and their child fall into the river. Ganga gets hold of his child but cannot find Jamuna. Jamuna loses her memory, but reaches the home of singer Shankar (Mithun Chakraborty), who fell in love with her the first time he saw her during one of his qawaali programmes. Meanwhile, a girl, Saraswati (Jayaprada) emerges, who loves Ganga. The remainder of the movie deals with how Ganga and Jamuna reunite, the roles played by Saraswati and Shankar, and how Ganga exacts his revenge from Thakur.
