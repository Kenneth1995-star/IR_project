Vallarasu

Vallarasu (Vijayakanth) is the Deputy Commissioner of Police and a very honest police officer who has arrested Wasim Khan (Mukesh Rishi), a terrorist from Pakistan. He is married and has a wife Anjali (Devayani) and 2 children. Vallarasu kills his senior police officer (Raghuvaran), who is his father-in-law, on knowing he is hand-in-glove with terrorists and anti-national elements. Anjali leaves Vallarasu after she comes to know he had killed her father. Vallarasu takes the help of some youths who are disillusioned by their inability to join the police force to fight the terrorist and other criminal elements. Vallarasu fights R. Kandasamy (P. Vasu), a rich man who is behind the attempts to destabilise the country. With the help of Seshadri (Karan), a software engineer, Vallarasu succeeds in killing the son of Kandasamy. In retaliation, Kandaswamy attacks (Sriman) and Seshadri who both die. In the climax, Anjali unites with Vallarasu after knowing the truth, and he kills Kandasamy and Wasim Khan.
