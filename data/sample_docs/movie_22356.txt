Me and My Moulton

Me and My Moulton is a humorous autobiographical short film based on Kove's experiences as a 7-year-old girl in Norway, one of three sisters who long for a bicycle. The film explores the emotions of Kove's character, who is often embarrassed by their unorthodox architect parents.[4]
Kove was quoted in a Toronto Star article as saying the story had been on her mind for years and that her goal was to convey a girl’s conflicting feelings about her parents: “These feelings are not easy for kids. It’s confusing when you don’t have all the insights that you get later in life to realize your parents embarrass you but at the same time you really love them. There are mixed emotions.”[4]
