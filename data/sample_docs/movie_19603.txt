Ambush in Leopard Street

Small time crook Harry (played by Michael Brennan) plans one last job before he retires, but things do not go quite according to plan. Bruce Seton, who played police sleuth Fabian on television, here plays against type as Harry's sidekick 'Nimmo'. The plan is to ambush a truck containing Â£500,000 of diamonds as it makes its way down Leopard Street, but heavy security means recruiting a larger criminal gang than usual, and inexperienced newcomers threaten to derail Harry's scheme.
