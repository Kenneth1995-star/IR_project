Bewafa Sanam

Sundar and Sheetal love each other and hope to get married soon. His mother approves of this match, Sundar makes his living by playing cricket and has become a very popular cricketer and this has brought about many enemies in his life. Among them are Gautam, who conspires with Sheetal to bring about the destruction of Sundar, to which Sheetal agrees because Gautam has Sheetal's mother captive and threatens to kill her if Sheetal does not agree to all his schemes and they send goons after him and after trashing the goons, he lands himself in jail and here is where he will find out that Sheetal is not what she claims to be. Frustrated at this, on Sheetal and Gautam's wedding, Sundar picks up a pistol and shoots Sheetal in public and is charged for this crime, a charge that carries the death sentence. Later in the movie, a journalist tries to help him and finds out everything that happened. It is revealed that the actual murderer was Gautam. Once Sundar realises that Sheetal was forced to do everything and she actually loved him, he requests the authority to let him visit Sheetal's grave one last time before he is hanged for his crime and they fulfill his request. Sundar kisses the grave and the police come with a letter saying that Sundar is free. Everyone becomes happy and they call Sundar, but he dies kissing the grave of his lover.[2]
