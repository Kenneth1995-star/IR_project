Patiala House

The movie is about Parghat Singh Kahlon alias Gattu / Kaali (Akshay Kumar) who is living the life his father Gurtej Singh Kahlon (Rishi Kapoor) chose for him. Gattu had been good at cricket and wanted to play for England though his dad would never let him become a member of the England team. His dad had told him if he played he would commit suicide. His siblings hated him as he was an exemplary in the house. He was always alone until Zeeshan and Simran (Anushka Sharma) come into his life.
In the present day, Gattu gets another chance to fulfil his dream and Simran and his siblings convince him to give it a shot. If he gets on the team, their father might be able to realise that the world isn't as racist as it used to be. As he gets on the team, they hide the fact that Gattu is on the team but their father eventually finds out. Seeing his son on a team he despises gives him a heart attack and he ends up in the Emergency Room. Gattu plays cricket anyway for his siblings. He is deeply hurt to be disgraced by his father but he also loves cricket and hopes to change his father.
The people of Southall all come together and try to convince Gurtej that it is okay to be a cricket player for England. He locks himself inside the house where his wife tells him that she has never acted as a mother, only as a wife and often forgot she was both. She turns on the T.V. wanting to see her son fulfil his dream. Gurtej watches with her and realises how badly he had treated his son. The family comes back in the house and Gurtej requests for one of them to drive him to the stadium. Gattu is playing poorly because he is so upset that his father disgraced him. Only at the last ball of the game, Gattu manages to win the championship for England. His father compares his bowling to Late Lala Amarnath. His father apologises to him and Gattu's siblings are now able to follow their dreams.
