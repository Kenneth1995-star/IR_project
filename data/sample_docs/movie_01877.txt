Enchanted April

At Hampstead Court Housewives Club, two women sit in the living room with a fireplace. Outside it's raining. One of the women reads a book (a Biography of Madame Du Barry); the other woman is nervously looking in the room and finally decides to look up the newspaper. When she sees a certain announcement she has to talk, saying to the other woman how beautiful it would be to leave dreadful London and go south to Italy, renting a Castle for two or more people and splitting the costs. So they find the way to San Salvatore and the Enchanted April is there from the very minute they arrived.
Their husbands and lovers are soon popping up and passing by, and the Italians who know, understand the English people. A mixture of slapstick comedy and on the other side the rarefied figure of Ann Harding.
