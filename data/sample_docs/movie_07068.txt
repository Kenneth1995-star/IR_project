Man in the Shadow

The cow town of Spurline is effectively ruled by Virgil Renchler (Welles), owner of the Golden Empire ranch.
One night, some of Renchler's hands beat a young laborer, Juan Mart√≠n, to death. The newly elected sheriff of Spurline, Ben Sadler (Chandler), decides to investigate the murder, but must contend with Renchler's henchmen and the fierce opposition of the townspeople, who fear Spurline would be ruined without the Golden Empire's business.
Ranch foreman Ed Yates admits to Renchler that he killed Martin, but employee Chet Huneker is persuaded to tell the law that he hit Martin accidentally with a car. Renchler's daughter, Skippy (Miller), tells the sheriff what she remembers from the night of Martin's death.
Sadler is beaten by Yates and Huneker, then dragged through town, tied to the back of a truck. Sadler gets a shotgun, tosses aside his badge and, with help from cropper Aiken Clay (Dano), goes after Renchler and his men, defeating them with the help of the townspeople, who then return Sadler's badge to him.
