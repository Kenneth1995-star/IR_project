Engal Thangam

The capital of the Tamil Country at the end of the 60s...
Thangam (MGR), a nice truck driver comes to the rescue of Soumadhi (Pushpalatha), his blind younger sister, by putting on (by assuming) the offences of Moorthy (A. V. M. Rajan), her husband.
Moorthy is a childhood friend of Thangam.
Today, Moorthy fell to the hands of a mysterious group of burglars, because he 's the best professional safe-cracker in the city.
Thangam wants at all costs to save him from this gang and to stop them.
Thangam will be helped in his quest by beautiful and intelligent Kaladevi (Jayalalithaa), his lover.
