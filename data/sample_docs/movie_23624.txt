Wong Kai Joe (Louis Fan) has had hatred of his uncle Wong Ping Yee (Sammo Hung) in his heart for a very long time and does what he can to oust his uncle from the village and to claim rights to the Dragon Head Cleaver, a symbol of power to the clan. During a function, he used Yee's nephew to put poison in the form of salt. The guest become sick and Wong Ping Yee is forced out of the village. The story then shifts to Ken'chi who is the first to graduate from his school after being the first amongst his batch to place the emblem in the flag.
