Minority Opinion

Tenants who have been evicted from their homes are in the middle of a sit-in protest, when the police arrive. A 20-year-old police officer and a 16-year-old boy, the son of a demonstrator, end up dead. The boy's father, Park Jae-ho gets arrested for the cop's death, but he insists it was self-defense and that he had only been trying to protect his son from being beaten by the riot police. Rookie public defender Yoon Jin-won is initially doubtful of Park's claims, until he gets approached by reporter Gong Soo-kyung who has her own suspicions about the government's account of the incident. Yoon then teams up with fellow lawyer Jang Dae-seok to pursue the truth through a jury trial.
