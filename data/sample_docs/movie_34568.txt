Spies, The !The Spies

Section chief Kim (Kim Myung-min) was dispatched to South Korea 22 years ago to spy for the North Korean government. But spying is not his job anymore, or at least, it’s not what he does in daily life. Now, Kim makes a living by selling fake Viagra pills smuggled from China and returns home every night to his wife and two loving children.
When Kim unexpectedly receives an assassination order from his boss (Yoo Hae-jin), he gathers his teammates which consist of assistant manager Kang (Yum Jung-ah), a single mother and real estate agent, adviser Yoon (Byun Hee-bong), a retired senior citizen who specializes in making forged IDs, and assistant manager Woo (Jung Gyu-woon), a farmer whose expertise lies on hacking computers. Although these four people no longer want to be part of the assassination coup, they have no choice but to follow the order.
While performing a reconnaissance routine, Kim enters the residence of their target as a cable repairman and notices a large safe in one of the rooms. Later, he meets his fellow spies and devises a secondary plan to steal the safe’s money. No one knows if they will actually be able to get hold of the money as they in turn have become the target of the South Korean government.[5]
