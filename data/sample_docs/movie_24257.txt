Ladies Only

Three girls from different regions of India, Sabita Devi (Gujarat), Bibbo (Punjab), and Prabha (Bengal) meet at a railway station. With no place to stay they decide to find accommodation together. A cook (Bhudo Advani) joins them speaking the language from each state. A young crook (Surendra) enters their life and trouble starts brewing between the girls when they all fall in love with him.
