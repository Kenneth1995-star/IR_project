God for Sale

God for Sale is a satirical take on what all determines the faith of a person. The film opens with the arrest of Poornananda Swami (Kunchacko Boban) who is alleged of child sacrifice. His story is unveiled through versions put forth by the accused and his brother (Suraj Venjaramoodu).
The plot of the movie shifts to the seventies. Attingal village is home to Kamalasanan Pillai (Suraj Venjaramoodu), a tailor. One fine morning, after a Kadhaprasangam performance, Pillai was found dead under suspicious circumstances. From there, the plot shifts to a more contemporary period. Prasannan (Kunchakko Boban), son of Kamalasanan Pillai, is now a hardworking daily wages labourer, who has a lady love (Jyothi Krishna). Again, the backdrop changes, and the protagonist is seen as a brilliant law student in a famous college. Prasannan confronts some bitter truths in his early life that alters his personality. When he joins the college, he is attracted to Leftist thinking. Later he falls in love with a rich woman, and eventually turns into an affluent person, and an emotional downfall turns him into an alcoholic. The journey of Prasannan from there to the retreat centre and ultimately to a person who claims to be the avatar of God is the storyline of the film.
