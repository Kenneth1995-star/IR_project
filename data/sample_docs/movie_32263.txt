Capt. C. S. Nair, a Naval officer, and Rekha constitute a happily married couple. Inspector Stephen and captain are good friends. When the captain leaves for his job, Rekha has to spend a lonely life in their big mansion. She occasionally takes a drive and spends time with Stephen's daughter Lilly. Captains elder sister Sharada, who was staying separate from her husband, had a kid Biju. Sharada had died of tumour and since then Rekha was taking care of Biju like her own son.
During the next occasion of leave, when captain is informed that Sharada is no more, he suggests to admit Biju in a boarding, so that he gets the best ever schooling possible. Captain meets Balu, a photographer, accidentally and he likes him very much and treat as his own brother. They spend times together along with Balu's friends in outings and other leisure events.
Captain leaves for his job and Rekha and Balu fall in an affair accidentally. Balu realize that it is a mistrust and runs away from the affair. Rekha had a difficult time to recover from the incident. However she could not conceal it for long, and during the next visit of Captain she discloses about the affair. Though she doesn't reveal the man, Captain traces that Balu is the culprit owing to the indifference in behaviour of Balu.
As he couldn't be the same husband again, Captain insists Balu to marry Rekha, which Balu denies. Leaving to what his mind leads forms the climax.
