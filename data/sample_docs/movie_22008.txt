Two Thousand and None

A recently divorced paleontologist visits his doctor who informs him that he is suffering from an unusual brain disease called Talbot's Syndrome, and that he has less than six weeks to live. Initially philosophical about his fate, the man decides to enjoy himself as much as he can until his imminent death, much to the disapproval of his ex-wife, his best friend, his boss, and his new girlfriend. Before long, he starts having evocative visions of his childhood in Armenia and decides, as his last mission in life, to dig up his parents in Canada and bury them in Armenia, where he believes his family belongs.[3]
