Thangavel (V. K. Ramasamy) runs a successful business enterprise with his partner Sabapathy (V.S. Raghavan). He has a large urn which he considers bad luck. To get rid of it he donates it as a prize for a competition at his daughter Latha's (K.R. Vijaya) college.
Bhaskar (Jaishankar) lives with his best friend Seenu (Nagesh). He is in love with Latha and they go to the same college. At the competition, Bhaskar wins the urn and back home while cleaning the urn, Seenu and Bhaskar unwittingly release a Genie imprisoned in the vase for three thousand years.
The name of the genie is Jee-Boom-Baa (The Tamil version of Abracadabra) (Javar Sitaraman), who vows to help the two guys who set it free. It offers them money, cars, mansions to live and takes care of every need of them. Bhaskar who is in love with Latha, seeks the magic powers of Jee-Boom-Ba to impress Latha's dad but things don't go quite as planned.
Sabapathy and his son (K. Balaji) who are running a smuggling racket, realise that something is amiss with Bhaskar's sudden ascent. The enemies of Bhaskar seize this opportunity to abduct Latha and a series of dramatic incidents ensues. Will Jee-Boom-Baa come back to help the friends?
