Jekhane Bhooter Bhoy

The film starts with Tarinikhuro or Tarinicharan Banerjee, one of Satyajit Ray's characters, telling some boys from his fanclub about ghosts. In the first and second stories the ghosts he talks about were Satyajit Ray's Anath Babur Bhoy and Brown Saheber Bari. The last one was Sharadindu Bandyopadhyayâ€™s Bhut Bhabishyat.(initially four stories were supposed to be filmed, but the fourth one, Lucknowe Duel was dropped later to avoid the length).[3]
