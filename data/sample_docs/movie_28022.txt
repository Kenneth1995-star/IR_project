Kanichukulangarayil CBI

Ajith (Saikumar) and Suresh (Meghanathan) are the proprietors of Aanamala Chit Funds. The success of Aanamala Chit Funds is the hard work of its Managing Director, Ratheesh. But due to some differences between his bosses, Ratheesh resigns and sets up another firm and started competing with Aanamala.
Ratheesh becomes successful soon and this makes Ajith and Suresh jealous. Soon, Ratheesh and his sister are killed by an oncoming truck while travelling by car at Kanichukulangara. First the police starts investigation, but due to corrupt officials the investigation goes wrong. Then CBI intervenes.
