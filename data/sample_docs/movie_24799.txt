Ek Nari Ek Brahmachari

Raisaheb Surajbhan Chaudhary lives a wealthy lifestyle in a palatial mansion with his wife of 30 years, Rajlaxmi, and two sons, Rajkumar, who has been married to Shyama for several years; and Mohankumar who is studying in an out of town college. Surajbhan is disappointed with Rajkumar as he has as not yet produced an heir to his family. To make matters worse Mohan, a devout worshiper of Lord Bajrangbali, has taken a vow of celibacy and refuses to get married. Things change dramatically when a young woman named Neena, along with her son, enters the Chaudhary household claiming that Mohan had married and abandoned her. She goes through a number of medical tests which determine that the child is actually an heir of the Chaudhary family. Now Surajbhan and Rajlaxmi want Mohan and Neena to get officially married, much to Mohan's chagrin. Things get complicated when Surajbhan finds out that the child is actually Rajkumar's, and that Neena may have been pulling the wool over all their eyes.
