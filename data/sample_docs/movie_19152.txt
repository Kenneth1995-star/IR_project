The Gay Dog

A miner, Jim Gay, owns a greyhound, "Raving Beauty", which has been very successful in races at the local stadium. But his bets on the dog are not winning him much money, so Gay hits upon a plan to lengthen its starting odds and clean up at the bookies. Putting the plan into practice is no easy task, especially as he is also intent on marrying off his daughter to his young friend and fellow miner.[3][4]
