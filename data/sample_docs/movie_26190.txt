The background of the movie is student politics in the University of Allahabad and the dirty turn it takes. When Anirudh (Jimmy Sheirgill) meets Niharika (Hrishitaa Bhatt) at university, they quickly become romantically involved. Unfortunately, their relationship can't escape the political battles between two rival gangs of students headed by Gaurishankar Pandey (Ashutosh Rana) and Ranvijay Singh(Irrfan Khan). When Anirudh meets Ranvijay (Irfan Khan), who has eliminated Gaurishankar Pandey, the former believes that he is merely helping his fellow student.
Anirudh gets involved in violent politics and shoots Niharika's cousin accidentally. Ranvijay Singh helps him escape to Mumbai with the help of his aide (Rajpal Yadav). Anirudh later learns the truth of Ranvijay Singh whose ultimate aim is to marry Niharika.
Badrishankar Pandey (Murad Ali), the brother of slain Gaurishankar Pandey, helps Anirudh kill Ranvijay in order to avenge the loss of his brother. A fierce gun battle takes place at the Kumbh Mela between the gangs of Ranvijay and Badrishankar Pandey before Anirudh kills Ranvijay. The Chief Minister, Kamalnath Tiwari (Sudhir Pandey) helps them escape the crime scene and gets Anirudh discharged from all the cases as he was also blackmailed by Ranvijay.
