Candy Mountain

Set in New York City, Candy Mountain tells the tale of a struggling guitarist named Julius (O'Connor). After he promises a rock star he can find an elusive guitar maker and acquire his valuable products,he sets off on a quest to Canada to find the legendary Elmore Silk (Yulin), in order to strike a deal with him. Along his journey via T-Bird, Volkswagon, and hitchhiking, he experiences a series of encounters and misadventures with those who claim to have known the reclusive Silk. Each encounter provides him with valuable insight into the kind of man Silk is, and his journey is filled with “musicians playing small roles: David Johanson as the star who wants to buy up the guitars, Tom Waits as Elmore’s middle-class brother, Joe Strummer as a punk, Dr. John as Elmore’s cranky son-in-law, Leon Redbone as one-half of a peculiar Canadian family who enjoy imprisoning passers-by”[4]. As he ventures further North, and reaches Canada, he is finally in the presence of the famous guitarist he had been searching for. Once he meets Silk, he is faced with the realization that financial gain is nothing compared to the development of one's artistic ability.
