Bhavani (Kushboo) is an inspector at police station of woman officers, with a head constable (Ambika) and two constables (Kovai Sarala and Vindhya) also in operation, with a driver (Vadivelu). Bhavani falls in love with engineer Subramani (Ranjith), whom she financially supports, and eventually gets married with him, while continuing to adopt a non-nonsense approach to her police duty.
In a sub-plot, the assistant commissioner (Anuja) assists the Deputy Commissioner (Thalaivasal Vijay) in indulging in unlawful acts and eventually facilitates him to rape Chithra (Vindhya) inside the premises of the jail. How Bhavani finds the culprits and achieves justice forms the rest of the tale.
