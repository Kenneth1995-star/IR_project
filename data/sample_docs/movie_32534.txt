Lovely

Akash (Aadi) is a practical and easy going young guy and he does not have a very good opinion about women and love stories. His friend Kittu (Vennela Kishore) is in a Facebook relationship with a girl named Lalli (Chinmayee Ghatrazu). When the time comes to meet each other, Kittu develops cold feet and out of a fear of rejection, sends in Akash to meet Lalli. On the other side, Lalli decides to send her friend Lavanya (Shanvi) to the meeting. It is love at first sight for this ‘new’ couple and very soon, they develop a deep bond. Just when everything seems nice and rosy, Lavanya’s father Mangalampalli Maharadhi (Rajendra Prasad) enters the scene and he is not impressed with Akash’s behaviour. It is now up to Akash to convince Maharadhi to change his mind. Will Maharadhi change his mind
