Yolki 1914

The film takes place in the Russian Empire in 1914 against the backdrop of the First World War which is just beginning. Six segments tell about life in large and small Russian cities, in noblemen's estates and poor urban families.
Dandy Boris Efimovich (Ivan Urgant) buys a manor on the Black Sea coast to impress his rich bride Bella (Evgeniya Khirivskaya), but former owner of the house Evgeny Pavlovich (Sergey Svetlakov) does not have the heart to tell the numerous households who live there that they do not have a home anymore. And to make matters worse, the next day is Christmas.
Ivan (Aleksandr Pal), a soldier lying in a hospital set up in the Konstantinovsky Palace, collects signatures from all over Russia to return the holiday of the tree. Officer of the tsarist army (Konstantin Khabensky) helps him in this matter.
Officer of the tsarist police Pyotr Kuznetsov (Artur Smolyaninov) and his girlfriend Xenia (Katerina Shpitsa) are to perform at the international figure skating championship in Russia, but Pyotr is torn between love for the sport, the girl and his service.
Village lad Senka (Anton Bogdanov) is friends with a tame bear, but the extravagant and ever-hungover gentleman (Yan Tsapnik) is trying to separate them in order to curry favor with the count (Viktor Verzhbitsky) who has long wanted to hunt a bear.
Friends from Yekaterinburg (Alexander Golovin and Alexander Domogarov, Jr.), enlist as volunteers for the war, and before leaving they want to visit their acquaintance Katya (Anna Khilkevich), who has not decided which of them she chooses to have as a boyfriend. But Katya is in Perm. She calls the guys to visit, but also requests them to pick up her grandmother Marya Ilinichna (Galina Stakhanova).
Glasha and her little brother Grisha need a Christmas miracle - their mother is very sick, and there is no money or food left for the family. They are saved by a chance meeting with Feodor Chaliapin.
