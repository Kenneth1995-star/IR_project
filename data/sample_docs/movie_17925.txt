The story is set in Australia in Sydney where Will Henderson (Brett Lee), tall and blonde with a charming smile, who teaches Australian English to immigrants, falls in love with Meera (Tannishtha Chatterjee), a beautiful divorcee Australian woman of Indian origin and a single mother of a 10-year-old girl, Smitha. Meera is smart and independent and has carved out a successful life for herself and her daughter. Meera 's ex-husband Deepak Khurana (Gulshan Grover) had earlier tried to lure and take away infant Smitha with him to India but was nabbed by the police after a complaint by Meera. While Meera's parents (Akash Khurana) and (Supriya Pathak) want to make a good match for her, she is not ready for any relationship. It takes a while before Meera is willing to take a risk by dating Will, despite family pressure to find 'a nice Indian match'; how the situation between Meera and Will develops through a series of ups and down is the focus of the narrative. Smitha confides in Will that she wants to meet her father, to which Will responds by helping her to meet him. But the clever Deepak hatches a plan to leave for India via New Zealand with Smitha. He almost succeeds but is nabbed by the police again after Will reveals to Meera his attempt to help Smitha. Meera lashes out at Will for his folly and tells him that Deepak is gay and a very mean, self-centered man who is least interested in his daughter. Police are informed and block Sydney airport and railway station, ultimately stopping Deepak at the port where he was planning to escape by ship with Smitha. After some misunderstanding, Will decides to quit his job and leave Sydney. Smitha asks her mother to stop Will from leaving since he is a good man at heart. Meera agrees and rushes to the airport to stop Will but finds that the flight has already taken off. She returns home dejectedly but is surprised to find Will there with her parents and daughter Smitha waiting for her.
