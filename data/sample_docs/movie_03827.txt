The Impostor

Clement (Gabin), a condemned murderer literally minutes away from the guillotine, is "liberated" when the Nazis bomb the French jail that holds him. During his escape he steals the uniform and identification papers of a dead French soldier. He then hides from the law by joining the Resistance movement. Clement's new identity and purpose in life reform him. In the end he sacrifices himself in service of his country.
