Pallavi

Shanta (Vimala Naidu), a bouncy university teenager, wants to grow her hair as long as that of Vyjayanthimala and is as idealistic as her boyfriend Chandru. The two apply for the same job, which Shanta gets. She eventually marries her boss, Jagannathan (P. Lankesh), but continues working. Her old boyfriend suddenly resurfaces, a fugitive from justice, and accuses her of having sold out in return for security.[1]
