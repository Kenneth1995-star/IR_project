Namma Annachi

Ayya (R. Sarathkumar) was an honest police officer, the villagers respected him for protecting the village against the heartless don Vaiyapuri (Mohan Natarajan). He lived hapilly with his wife (Rupini) and his son Annachi. One day, the don killed Ayya and his wife in front of their son. Later, Annachi hurted heavily Vaiyapuri and fled to the city.
20 years later, Annachi (R. Sarathkumar) worked hard and became a brave man who fought against the injustice. He was adopted by an old couple (S. S. Chandran and Ganthimathi). Vaiyapuri controlled the city. Annachi began to work in Vaiyapuri's factory and realized that the factory paid the labourers less than expected. Gayathri (Raadhika), a labour officer, came to help them but Vaiyapuri sent her to jail for prostitution. Annachi and Gayathri finally got married. During a strike, Annachi saw Vaiyapuri trying to kill the strikers. So Annachi turned berserk and killed Vaiyapuri.
20 years later, Annachi becomes a godfather who helped the poor and the oppressed while Annachi's only son Prabhakaran (R. Sarathkumar) becomes a lawyer. Prabhakaran and Priya (Heera Rajagopal) fall in love with each other. Vadivelu (Radha Ravi), who was Vaiyapuri's right-hand, is now a corrupted politician. At the election, all citizens vote for the non-candidate Annachi, thus canceling the election. An angry candidate poisons poor persons during Annachi's fest and Annachi kills him. Prabhakaran sees this murder and the matter is taken up in court by Prabhakaran who wants to punish his own father. Annachi is later discharged. Soon, Annachi clashes with Vadivelu and Vadivelu kills Gayathri. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
