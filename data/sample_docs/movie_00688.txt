Dressed to Kill

The gang of a mob boss grow suspicious of his new girlfriend. She's a beautiful young girl and they don't believe she would actually associate with the mob and wonder if she's really a police "plant". The mobsters dress nattily to not appear "out of place" in the ritzy neighborhoods prior to a heist.
