Hanuman Junction

Krishna (Arjun) and Dasu (Jagapati Babu) are orphans and are close friends since childhood. Their motto in life is to win over the people and market by brute force methods. They start KD & Co together and make a fortune. Dasu has a younger sister Devi (Vijayalakshmi). Krishna too treats her as his own sister. Three of them live together and own a fortune earned at Hanuman Junction. Krishna has a childhood sweetheart Meenakshi (Sneha).
Sathru (Venu Thottempudi) joins KD & Co as a manager. He has a flashback. He loves Devi back in college. But she expresses her helplessness by telling that she marries the guy who is recommended by her brothers. Sathru is on the mission to win over the brothers to marry Devi. KD & Co organizes a cultural show in which Sangeeta (Laya) participates as a singer. The foolishness of KD & Co makes Sangeeta stay for four extra in Hanuman Junction, which lands her in a soup. When Sangeeta attempts suicide, Dasu and Krishna rescues her and brings her to their house.
Now Sathru and Devi decide to get a suitable girl each for Krishna and Dasu so that they will give green signal to the marriage of Sathru and Devi. From here onwards, the comedy or errors start. The relationships among the pairs alter. If you want to know how a serious mass film turns into a comedy flick with Venu excelling as a comedy star, you got to watch Hanuman Junction on the silver screen.[4]
