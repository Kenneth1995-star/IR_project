Hochelaga, Land of Souls (Hochelaga terre des Ã¢mes)

One night on the campus of McGill University, a rainstorm opens a sinkhole in the field during a game at Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, killing one player. Observing the development, archaeologist Antoine Morin theorizes the sinkhole may lead to evidence of Hochelaga, where French explorer Jacques Cartier contacted Indigenous peoples in Quebec. Morin hires Baptiste, a graduate student studying Mohawk history, to lead an archaeological excavation of the field.
The study brings to light that the site was the scene of a hard-fought battle between Indigenous warriors in 1267, when many Iroquoians were killed. Jacques Cartier arrives in 1535, claiming the land for the Kingdom of France. The territory subsequently sees an outbreak of fever in 1687. During the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837, two French Canadian Patriote rebels seek sanctuary with the lady Sarah Walker, who attempts to guard them against British Colonel Philip Thomas.
