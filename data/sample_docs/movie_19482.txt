The Treasure of San Teresa

Ex-OSS operative Larry Brennan (Eddie Constantine) returns to Czechoslovakia after retiring from his military service during World War II. He is intent on seeking out a hidden cache of Nazi jewels stashed in this country during the war. There he has to join with Hedi von Hartmann (Dawn Addams), his former lover and a daughter of the German general who previously owned the gems, but Larry is not sure whether he can trust her. Soon Larry begins to realise that he is being double-crossed and triple-crossed.[4]
