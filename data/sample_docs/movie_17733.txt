Visitors

The film deals with the feelings of a young woman sailing solo on a yacht around the world. The loneliness makes her start losing her sanity. The film in some ways is close to the theme of The Shining by Stanley Kubrick. Director Richard Franklin attempts to create an atmosphere of isolation and cabin-fever phenomena experienced by the lonely girl in the open sea.
