Tomboys

Kat has been the victim of repeated sexual assault and has had enough. Along with her group of mates, she has decided that since the law won't hand out any justice, then it's time to take matters into her own hands and distribute some payback on her own terms. It helps that one of her friends has a disused barn on her isolate property that should afford some privacy from prying eyes.[3]
A party provides the opportunity for Kat and her friends to kidnap the intended target, who is a serial rapist, and immobilise him in the barn soon to drip blood.
