Kunwara Baap

Prannath (Kishore Sahu) goes to the jeweller’s to buy a ring for his to-be fiancée. While he is in the store, an unwed mother leaves her infant in the back of Prannath’s car. When he comes out he realises he’s stuck with the baby much to his discomfiture as his betrothed refuses to believe his story. The situation gives rise to several funny sequences till the villainous father of the child admits to being the real father and agrees to marry the mother of the abandoned child.
