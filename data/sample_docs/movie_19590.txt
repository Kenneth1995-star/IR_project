A Taste of Honey

Jo (played by Rita Tushingham) is a 17-year-old Salford schoolgirl,[3] with a difficult, 40-year-old alcoholic mother, Helen (Dora Bryan). After sustaining a fall while walking past the dockyards after school, Jo meets a black sailor called Jimmy (Paul Danquah) who invites her onto his ship to attend to her grazed knee. They soon start a brief romantic relationship, after which Jimmy returns to his ship and departs. Relations between Jo and her mother become strained when her mother meets and marries a new man, Peter Smith (Robert Stephens).
Feeling rejected by her mother, Jo starts a job in a shoe shop and rents a flat on her own. She meets a gay textile design student, Geoffrey Ingham (Murray Melvin), and invites him to move in with her. When Jo discovers she is pregnant by Jimmy, Geoff is supportive of her, even offering to marry her, saying at one point: "You need somebody to love you while you're looking for somebody to love."
Helen re-appears on the scene after the failure of her relationship with Peter, who turns out to have been a selfish lout. She moves in with Jo, which causes tensions between Helen and Geoff. Geoff decides he can no longer stay at the flat and moves out, leaving Helen to care for Jo and her soon-to-be-born baby. Symbolic of Helen's disdain of Geoffrey is her return, near the end of the film, of the bassinet he gave to Jo.
