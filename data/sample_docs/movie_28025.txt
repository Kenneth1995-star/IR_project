Veruthe Oru Bharya

Sugunan (Jayaram) is a husband who habitually underestimates his wife Bindu (Gopika) in managing a family. Sugunan wants his wife only to keep house - cook food for him, iron his clothes and clean the house. Bindu does all these and more, but there's never a word of appreciation or a compliment from her husband. He doesn't even acknowledge the work that she is doing without any rest in her life. This often results in quarrels between them, but like any docile Indian wife, Bindu tolerates it for some time.
Sugunan is also indifferent (and possibly hostile) to Bindu's family - even though her father makes many attempts to get close to him. Bindu is upset at his behaviour. When he has the electricity supply to her father's house shut down since they were drawing power from the electrical grid, during her brothers wedding,Bindu misunderstands.
Later, during a trip to Kodaikanal, Sugunan doesn't "allow" Bindu to indulge in normal tourist activities like train rides etc. Sugunan's indifference when Bindu's mother dies drives home the point that she is just a non entity in her husband's life. Once Sugunan slaps her in a fit of rage and she decides enough is enough and goes back to her house.
A boy persuades Sugunan's teenage daughter Anjana (Nivetha Thomas) to go for a drive with him, and the jeep breaks down. Some thugs chance upon the hapless girl and try to molest her. The police arrive and rescue the two youngsters. Alarmed by the situation, Sugunan and Bindu are reunited and live happily ever after.
