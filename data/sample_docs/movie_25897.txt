Itihaas

Wealthy, powerful, and influential Thakur Digvijay Singh (Raj Babbar) come to a Village and fall in love with beautiful Naina (Twinkle Khanna). They are bethrothed and are to be married soon. But Naina has fallen in love with the son, Karan (Ajay Devgn), of Thakur's employee, Balwant (Amrish Puri). When Thakur finds out about this, he instructs his men to bring in Naina alive, and Karan dead. Karan and Naina run from this community all the way to Bombay. The Thakur announces a hefty reward, and soon bounty hunters are all over Bombay looking for the hapless couple. When Balwant hears about this, he too goes to Bombay, and does locate Karan and Naina. Karan is relieved to see his dad, but his relief soon turns to disbelief, as Balwant instructs him to let go of Naina, as he himself has come as an agent of the Thakur, not as his father.
