Sex Competition

An extravagant millionaire invites four young men to participate in a sex tournament - a game with a prize of half a million dollars. The goal is to seduce as many women as possible in 5 days of stay at the seaside resort. But the targets are not easy â€“ grandmother, wife of an oligarch, virgin, feminist and sectarian. But unexpectedly love starts to interfere with the game of sex.
