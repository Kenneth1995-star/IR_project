Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. 
AI is a broad field that includes machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.
Machine learning enables computers to automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
Applications of AI range from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis and financial forecasting.
