During his holiday, he meets his friends here and they bond every night over a few peg of drinks. During one of these days, Rashid's friend Nanmarayil Suran (Vinay Forrt), an autorickshaw driver, locks him with a prostitute in a garage from the outside to let the two have some fun. He fails to turn up as promised and the two end up spending two nights and one day together in the garage.
