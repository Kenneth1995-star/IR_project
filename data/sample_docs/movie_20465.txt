Business as Usual

Babs Flynn (Jackson) is the manager of a Liverpool boutique. When she accuses the regional manager of sexual harassment she is sacked and mounts a public campaign to get her job back. The film met with positive reviews. It starred a young Craig Charles as Cathy Tyson's love interest (they were a couple at the time). It was based on a real case at a chain of boutiques called Lady at Lord John.[1][2]
