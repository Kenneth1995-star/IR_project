Every Thing Will Be Fine

Tomas Eldan is a novelist, living with Sara in a rural area of Quebec. Their relationship is strained, as she wants marriage and children while he just wants to focus on his writing. Tomas is driving home on a wintery rural road when a toboggan carrying brothers Christopher and Nicholas slides into the path of his vehicle, resulting in Nicholas' death but causing no physical damage to five-year-old Christopher.
Tomas breaks up with Sara a short time after the tragic accident, then he briefly spirals into alcohol and drugs before ending up in hospital after a failed suicide attempt. He tries to get together with Sara again but it doesn't work. He turns his focus back to his writing, gaining success while still troubled by the effect of the tragedy on his life. He maintains fleeting contact with Kate, mother of Nicholas and Christopher, who struggles with her own guilt and loss. Tomas later marries Ann, an employee of his publishing house, adopting her daughter Mina.
Eleven years after the accident, a winner of the Giller Prize for his latest novel, Tomas receives a letter from now 16-year-old Christopher. Christopher is a self-proclaimed "problem child", whose school psychologist has suggested reaching out to Tomas. Their contacts are troubling, but end with Tomas and Christopher eventually helping each other get a calmer handle on their lives.
