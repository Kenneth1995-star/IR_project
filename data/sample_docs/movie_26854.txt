Login is a Hindi feature film about three different individuals and how the Internet and social networking sites changed their lives. True to its caption â€“ "Connected online but disconnected in life", the film portrays how everyone is glued to Internet and hence getting away from their true selves. Jai is a young office going guy who seeks a girl friend through on line dating sites. Vandana is a housewife who spends her free time chatting on social networking sites. Debu is a guy working in a call centre who uses the Net to make money. How the usage of the Internet had affected the lives of these three characters forms the crux of the story.
