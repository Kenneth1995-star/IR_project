Ithaya Geetham

A king is in deathbed. He requests his friend to take care of the queen (Rajalakshmi) and their daughter (Rajakumari). The friend has two sons. While the elder son (Veerappa) goes to fight a battle, the younger son (Mahalingam) and the princess fall in love with each other. The elder son returns victoriously and claims the hand of the princess. The princess vacillates. So the younger brother goes to another battle. But he gets injured. The princess realises her folly and helps in the treatment to the younger brother. The two brothers decide to settle on a duel. The younger brother wins and marries the princess.[2]
