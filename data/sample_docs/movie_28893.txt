K. Subramanyam

Chetha (Papanasam Sivan) is a cobbler of a lower caste and a devotee of Vishnu living in a slum situated near Hastinapura. Drona (Kothamangalam Subbu) believes that people like Chetha do not possess any right to worship God and treats Chetha in an inferior way. An unexpected turn of events occur when Drona's son, Seva (Ramachandra Iyer), falls in love with Chetha's daughter, Shantha (G. Subbulakshmi), who reciprocates his feelings. Chetha is shocked to learn of their love, but accepts it when he realises that God does not consider any distinction between caste and creed. However, Drona, on learning of Seva's love, becomes livid and immediately orders Chetha to make one thousand pairs of Sandals before daybreak, and that he will be beheaded in public if he fails to accomplish the task. Chetha starts making the sandals. After a point, he becomes completely exhausted and closes his eyes to rest. When he opens them however, he is surprised to find out that the one thousand pairs are ready. He realises that it is God's work. Seeing the task completed, Drona too realises the devotion of Chetha to Vishnu and happily accepts the marriage of Seva and Shantha.[2]
