Seenu

Seenu (Venkatesh) is an honest, not-too-good-looking, village artist who comes to the city to find a job. He ends up being a banner artist. Shwetha (Twinkle Khanna) is a U.S. citizen, who loves India and its culture and stays with her relatives to learn Bharatanatyam. She is a soft natured, loving girl who loves to help people in distress but cannot stand it if anyone lies or cheats. Initially, when these two meet, she mistakes Seenu to be a mute and pities him. Swetha's occasional friendlier association with Seenu, in the means of helping, gradually blossoms into love. By this time, it is too late for the guilt-ridden Seenu to disclose the truth as he feared the risk of losing her. Despite all his efforts to reveal the truth, Swetha comes to know of his sham by herself. However, at the end, she realizes Seenu's true intentions for acting as a mute and forgives him. However at the climax, when Swetha asks Seenu to speak to her, he keeps silent because he had asked a doctor to cut his tongue so that he could be the Swetha had come to love.
