Kismet Ka Khel

Pratap (Sunil Dutt) is accused of murdering the wealthy Seth Maganbhai Mehta. As a fugitive on the run, he meets Anokhi (Vyjayantimala) and her assorted group who make their living by any means, begging, stealing, or deceit. At first, Pratap is derisive of Anokhi and her friends. He soon realises the camaraderie they share and their inherent goodness. He slowly wins them over and changes their erring ways. Anokhi and her friends then help Pratap find the real murderer.
