Steal My Heart/Catch Me

Lee Ho-tae is a police profiler who has a 100 percent success rate in tracking down suspects. One day while he's on a stakeout, the criminal attempts to flee and gets run over in a hit and run accident. When Ho-tae follows the driver to make an arrest, he finds himself face to face with Yoon Jin-sook, the first girl he ever loved. Their relationship had ended ten years ago. Taken aback, Ho-tae stalls his fellow officers by locking up Jin-sook in his own home, but as old feelings resurface, he finds out more shocking truths about his ex-girlfriend, like the fact that she's a notorious thief who's long been on the most wanted list for stealing priceless artworks and gems across Seoul. Together, they try to come up with a solution to keep Jin-sook out of prison while the rest of the police force search for her.[6]
