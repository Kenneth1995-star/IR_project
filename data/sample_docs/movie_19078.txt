The Fake

When Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna and Child arrives at London's Tate Gallery for a special exhibition, American Paul Mitchell (Dennis O'Keefe) is assigned to guard it. However, on examination, Paul realizes the painting has been replaced with a fake. Joining forces with Tate employee Mary Mason (Coleen Gray), Paul attempts to find the original and collect the museum's $50,000 reward for its recovery.
