Touch of Pink

Alim is a young gay man. Born in Kenya and raised in Toronto, he moved to London to get away from his conservative upbringing. He faces the hardships of coming out to his widowed mother Nuru, as well as hardships in his relationship with his boyfriend Giles. Alim has an imaginary friend (or maybe a guardian angel or ghost friend, depending on how literally or symbolically one takes the film) who is supposedly Cary Grant, who gives Alim advice when he is in trouble. Unfortunately, the advice often seems to make more trouble.
