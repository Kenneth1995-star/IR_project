Guru Sishyan

Guru (Rajinikanth) and Sishya (Prabhu) are two friends and petty criminals. They end up in jail and come across an innocent man Manohar (Pandiyan) who tells them that his sister was raped by Muthuraaj (Radha Ravi) and who had killed a taxi driver (witness) with the help of foolish corrupt police officer Nallasivam (Vinu Chakravarthy) and pinned the murder on Manohar. Manohar is sentenced to death row for the killing by the court. Guru and Sishya believe in Manohar's story and decide to find the truth and prove his innocence once they get out of jail. Guru fractures Manohar's hand so that his death sentence would be delayed, until it heals, under law. Guru and Sishya get released from prison and set in motion an elaborate plan to find out the real killers. Along the way, Guru, who believed that his parents were murdered, finds out that they are in fact being held captive by Muthuraaj's brother Rajamanickam (Ravichandran), who is trying to find the map to a treasure. The location of the map is known only to Guru's father who is suffering from memory loss and is tortured to make him remember it. Babu finds out that his parents were murdered by Rajamanickam. Guru and Sishya help them find the treasure to free Guru's parents and Guru finds out that Manohar is his own brother. The ensuing fight at the treasure location, ends up with Muthuraaj and his brother arrested by the police after Guru and Babu beat them up and the treasure cave collapses after Guru, his family, and Sishya escape from it. Sishya marries Muthuraj's niece Chitra (Seetha) while Guru marries Nallasivam's daughter Geetha (Gautami) and they live happily ever after.
