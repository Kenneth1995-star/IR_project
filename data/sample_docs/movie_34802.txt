I Can Speak

An elderly woman (played by Na Moon-hee) constantly files complaints with the local office about the wrongs that she sees around her each day. Along the way, she forms an unlikely friendship with a junior civil service officer (played by Lee Je-hoon) who begins to teach her English. Being the teacher of the elderly woman, he realizes the genuine reason why she learned English and becomes an important supporter in earnest.
Though the film is a comedy, the genre serves as a vehicle to discuss the deeper topic of Korean "comfort women" during World War II.
