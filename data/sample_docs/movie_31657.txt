Vasanthi becomes very friendly with Madhu and behaves very close to him as she sees Madhu just as a brother and nothing else whereas in Madhu mistakes Vasanthi's friendly nature to love. One day Madhu has to leave to Chennai for higher studies. He writes letters but he never gets any reply from Vasanthi to any of his letters. When he comes back he finds out Vasanthi and her family left the city without telling anybody. Madhu finds a letter from which he realizes that Vasanthi only saw him as a brother. He gets very depressed and falls sick. Seetha (Savitri), Ramakrishnaiah (Gummadi)'s daughter takes care of Madhu by taking care of his health and giving him company. The whole story is how he recovers from the depression he faces because of Vasanthi.
