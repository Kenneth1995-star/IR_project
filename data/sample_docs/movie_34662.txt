Gyeongju

Choi Hyeon visits Korea to pay his respects to his recently deceased friend Kim Chang-hee. He sees his other friend Kang. Hyeon is a history professor by profession in China but people often mistake him for a weirdo. When people try to connect with him he snubs them, but maintains an outwardly close relation. After paying his respects he roams around Gyeongju, capital of the Silla Kingdom, and now famous for only tombs and tumulis. He visits a teahouse that he, Kim and Kang visited seven years ago. Hyeon gets curious about an erotic piece of art that vanished which was displayed there and shows interest in the current owner of the joint, Gong Yun-hee. They further start to spend the day together. She invites him to her bed but he is preoccupied with his thoughts and the picture. He leaves in the morning and knows that some people whom he saw yesterday have died. He wanders more. In the next morning at the teahouse Gong Yun-hee is seen curious about the erotic art which she has covered with wallpaper after acquiring the joint. A flashback is shown where Hyeon and his friends sit around the teahouse table and comment on the erotic poetry painting with the writing "Lets have a drink and then each other". Kim Chang-hee's current widowed wife appears to be the previous owner of the teahouse.
