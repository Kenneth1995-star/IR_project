House!

The aging "La Scala" bingo hall is administered by Welsh-Italian Giovanni Anzani (Freddie Jones). In its heyday, it was the United Kingdom's biggest bingo hall, but its glory days are gone... and though the facility is run-down, the staff is loyal. Gavin (Jason Hughes) is the cheeky bingo caller. When a large international conglomerate announces they are about to open a huge family entertainment center nearby, promising competition through large payouts for their own bingo competitions, Linda (Kelly Macdonald) comes to the aid of the La Scala using her psychic gift.[1]
