Tower of Terror

Anthony Hale is a British secret agent in Germany who takes a job as assistant to lighthouse keeper Wolfe Kristan and plans to return to England with some valuable papers. The plan is for him to be picked up by a British boat. He meets and befriends Marie, who has escaped from a concentration camp. She had tried to evade capture by the local police by jumping into the sea but was rescued and taken to the lighthouse by the deranged Kristan, who sees in her the image of Marthe, his wife whom he killed 16 years earlier and buried in the basement of the lighthouse. After several violent encounters with Kristan Hale and Marie manage to make their way down to the beach where they board the British boat. The lighthouse is destroyed by gunfire from a Germam destroyer whose captain had been alerted by Hale's signal to his rescue vessel; Kristan, prostrate with grief over his wife's opened grave, is killed during the bombardment.
