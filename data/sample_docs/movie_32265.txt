Ashok (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) is a mechanic who is thrown out of the house due to his rash actions that led to the death of his grandmother. His father (Prakash Raj) still harbours anger against Ashok despite his actions that have a positive outcome. He then accidentally meets an insecure yet talented dancer named Anjali (Sameera Reddy), and falls in love with her. Anjali witnesses a crime involving KK (Sonu Sood), the leader of one of the largest crime syndicates in Andhra Pradesh. KK attempts to engulf Anjali within his evil plans, while Ashok wages a one-man war against KK's gang.
KK gets Ashok's friend Rajiv (Rajiv Kanakala) killed while capturing Anjali. Ashok avenges his friend's death killing KK's man, thus enraging KK. His gang captures Ashok's sister and ask for Ashok in return for her safety. Ashok's father drags him to KK's manor and asks Ashok to save his sister. Ashok and KK fight each other and just when it seems like Ashok will emerge the winner, KK's mother (Vadivukkarasi) shoots at Ashok. However, she accidentally kills her own son and then she dies.
Eventually Ashok's sister is married and his father accepts Ashok again.
