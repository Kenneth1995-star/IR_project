Adalat

Dharam Chand or Dharma (Amitabh Bachchan), an amiable village farmer is thrilled when his wife, Radha (Waheeda Rehman) gives birth to a baby boy, whom they decide to name Raju. Dharma heroically saves the lives of Ajit (Anwar Hussain), Sujit (Sujit Kumar) and Suresh when they are being attacked by a tiger and they graciously offer him a job in Bombay (now Mumbai) whenever he decides to visit. When the village experiences economic crisis and drought, the family migrates to Bombay, where Ajit makes Dharma the manager of his warehouse in the city.
Dharma is very honest with his job and courteous as well. After a few months, Dharma is tricked into signing a document which makes him the owner of the warehouse he is working at. One fine day the police raid his warehouse and he is arrested for trafficking gold and drugs. Being a village simpleton he doesn't understand the law and is easily implicated by his bosses for illegal activities carried out by them.
