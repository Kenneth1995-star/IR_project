Professor Brij Mohan Agnihotri (I. S. Johar) is a confirmed bachelor, and he firmly refuses to get married. He has a student named Ramesh (Joy Mukherjee), who considers him his mentor. On a visit to his friend out of town, Brij meets his friend's beautiful daughter, Punam (Saira Banu), and falls in love with her. Throwing all caution to the winds, he changes his appearance, and attempts to conquer Punam, but he later finds that Punam is attracted to his student, Ramesh. Now the professor has to decide whether to get rid of Ramesh, or to reverse their roles and make him his mentor.
