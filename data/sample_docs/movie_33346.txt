Inuyasha the Movie: Affections Touching Across Time

Inuyasha's father defeated a powerful Chinese yōkai moth named Hyōga, five hundered years ago. The Shikon Jewel shard revives his son, Menōmaru, and his loyal servants, Ruri and Hari (who plan to avenge their family). When Miroku and Sango meet the duo, Ruri copies the wind tunnel and Hari possesses Kirara. Menōmaru kidnaps and places a spell on Kagome. He breaks the seal to release the power of his predecessors. Though becoming stronger, he achieves the title of the clan. While staying at the tree fortress, Menōmaru uses the spell to possess Kagome. Inuyasha attempts to evade Kagome, when he discovers that she is wearing Kikyō's clothes. Kagome inadvertently kills Inuyasha, pinning him with an arrow on "The Sacred Tree" (like Kikyō did to him fifty years ago). After Kagome resists the spell, she apologizes and seemingly mourns for Inuyasha. When Kikyō tells Kagome that she does not belong in the feudal era, she sends her to the "Bone-Eater's Well". A grief-stricken Kagome ends up returning in the present day and wanders though Tokyo. After sensing that Inuyasha is alive and unconscious under Menōmaru's spell, Kagome shoots the arrow into the well, causing it to explode and freeing Inuyasha from the spell. She travels back in time and reconciles with him. As Kirara resists the spell, Miroku and Sango defeat the duo. When Menōmaru emerges from the moth cocoon and reveals his giant body, Inuyasha and Kagome combine their powers to destroy Menōmaru. The two spend time in Tokyo.
