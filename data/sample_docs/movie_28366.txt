3 Dots

Vishnu (Kunchacko Boban), Pappan (Prathap Pothen) and Louis (Biju Menon) are three ex-convicts who live together at Pappan's abode, trying to pick up from where they had let their lives off before being jailed. After many unsuccessful efforts to find employment, they appeal to Dr. Isaac (Narain), who was a counsellor in the prison. He suggests that they consider some form of self-employment and he will support them. Vishnu converts Pappan's Omni into an ambulance. Pappan runs a playschool and Louis works for a driving school run by a neighbour, Grace (Anjana Menon), a widow. But Dr. Isaac has some other intentions in supporting them and this forms the crux of the story.
