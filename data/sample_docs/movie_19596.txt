A Weekend with Lulu

Young couple Timothy (Leslie Phillips) and Deirdre (Shirley Eaton) plan a romantic weekend on the coast in pal Fred’s (Bob Monkhouse) ice cream van and towed caravan, affectionately called “Lulu.” When Deidre’s mother (Irene Handl) insists on coming along as her daughter's chaperone, Timothy’s plans are somewhat compromised. A ferry boat mix-up further complicates things, and lands the holidaymakers in France where they encounter a variety of irate Frenchmen.
