Girl o' My Dreams

Larry Haines (Edward J. Nugent) is the school's track champion. The “Big Man on Campus”, his success goes straight to his head. His friends, Spec Early (Sterling Holloway), Bobby Barnes (Arthur Lake), and his girlfriend Gwen (Mary Carlisle), get fed up with him, and his swollen head.
They decide that he needs to get his big head deflated; so, they rig the “Joe Senior” college contest, so Larry comes in second. They make sure Don Cooper (Lon Chaney Jr.) wins; and, he begins to go out with Gwen, much to the dismay of his own steady girlfriend Mary (Gigi Parrish).
It soon becomes clear that Mary's not the only thing Don's forgotten about. It looks like both Don and Larry are in such a muddle they, and, their school, are going to lose the track meet. Once again, it's up to the girls to sort out the mess, and spur them on to victory.
