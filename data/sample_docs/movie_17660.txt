Parklands

Rosie returns home to attend the funeral of her father Cliff, who left her mother years earlier. His mistress Jean invites Rosie to stay with her for a while, allowing her time to learn about what her father was doing throughout the years they were separated. Her investigation into his past leads to diaries he kept, and entries he made suggest that despite his career as a policeman he was a corrupt man involved in the drug trade.
