Soulless 2

Escaping criminal prosecution in Russia, former bank executive manager Maxim Andreev (Danila Kozlovsky) lives in Bali, surfing and enjoying the sun and the ocean. Once he saves a life for an amateur surfer, who turns out to be the young head of the Russian state corporation that finances innovation. In gratitude, Roman (Miloš Biković) offers Max a job in Moscow. When news of this leaks, representatives of the Russian special services who are seeking compromising evidence against the state corporation, seek the expulsion of Andreev to Russia and demand from him that he accept Roman's proposal and gather material on his boss. Since otherwise he faces a prison, Max reluctantly becomes a "snitch" and again plunges into the world of Moscow's glamor.
