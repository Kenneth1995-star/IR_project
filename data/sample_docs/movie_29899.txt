Idhaya Vaasal

Aravind (Ramesh Aravind) is a successful businessman. His brother Murali (Achamillai Gopi) became a drunkard since his wife divorced him. So his father Krishnaswamy (Sethu Vinayagam) felt guilty and gave Aravind total freedom to choose his future wife. Aravind falls in love with Vaani (Meena) at first sight. He proposes his wish to Vaani's father, but he declines. He has his reason for itÂ : his elder daughter (Sabitha Anand) married a rich man and then they were separated. Aravind follows her everywhere despite being beaten and humiliated. Ganesh (R. Sarathkumar), an ex-police officer, befriends with Aravind and helps Aravind. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
