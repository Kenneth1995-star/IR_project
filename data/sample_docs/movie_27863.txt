Perumazhakkalam

Akbar (Dileep) is happily married to Raziya (Meera Jasmine). Akbar goes to the Persian Gulf for employment. There he befriends Raghu Rama Iyer (Vineeth) and John Kuruvilla (Biju Menon). The three become good friends. Akbar loans some money to another Indian named Haneefa working with them. Haneefa absconds with the money and all efforts to get back the money goes in vain. During a fight with Haneefa, Akbar hits him but misses and accidentally kills Raghu. He is now facing the death penalty. The only way for him to escape the penalty is to obtain a letter from Raghu's wife Ganga (Kavya Madhavan) that she pardons him.
Raziya and her father Abdu (Mamukkoya) travel to Palakkad to meet Ganga to plead for mercy and obtain such a letter from her. They stay in Abdu's old friend Kunjikannan's (Mala Aravindan) house. Ganga's in-laws refuse to let her meet Ganga but Raziya persists. She finally meets Ganga when she is visiting the temple, but Ganga is confused and leaves the scene. Raziya is finally thrown out from the community compound by Raghu's relatives. Ganga finally realizes that she must pardon Akbar, but Raziya has left for her home by then. Realizing that pardoning Akbar could lead to ostracisation by her community, Ganga braves the situation and meets Raziya and signs the letter of pardon. When she returns home, she is thrown out of her home by her in laws and the community.
Akbar returns after serving a seven years sentence and the family go to meet Ganga where the children of the families bond with each other oblivious to the relationship between their parents.
