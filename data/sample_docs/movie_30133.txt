Vishnu

Vishnu's (Vijay) father Thangadurai (Jaishankar) wants to bring up his son as a timid person, but Vishnu desires to explore the world and hates his father's overprotection, so Vishnu leaves home and goes to work in an estate claiming that he is an orphan. The owner of the estate adopts Vishnu as his son. Meanwhile, Vishnu falls in love with Radha (Sanghavi). Everything goes fine for Vishnu, until his adopted father shows a photograph and asks Vishnu to kill the people in the photo if he really wants to prove the affection he has for him. The man gives the reason that he wants them killed because they ruined his family. Vishnu agrees immediately, but he's shocked to see Thangadurai in the photo. How Vishnu gets to solve the mystery forms the climax of the movie.
