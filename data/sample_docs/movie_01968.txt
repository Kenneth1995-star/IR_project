Pursuit

Pilot Mitch Mitchell (Chester Morris) is asked to whisk a young child, Donny (Scotty Beckett), from California into Mexico by the youth's mother, who is involved in a nasty custody dispute with her sister. Mitch agrees to take on the job, but he must also take along Maxine (Sally Eilers), who works for an agency hired to bring the child back. She's agreed to help the boy escape, but the three must still avoid detection. Things come crashing to a head in Mexico.
