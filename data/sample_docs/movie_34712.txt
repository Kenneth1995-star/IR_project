Black Stone

Black Stone tells the story of a deserting army recruit who returns to his parents' home in Seoul, where they worked in a food processing factory, to find they have disappeared. Intent on discovering where they have gone, he enters the jungle where his father was born, and finds it to be contaminated.[1] The film is the last part of a trilogy about environmental pollution, inspired by the French film director Robert Bresson and the Thai film director Apichatpong Weerasethakul.[3]
