Dimanche/Sunday

Dimanche tells the story of a young boy who goes to his grandparents' house in a small town in Quebec after church on Sunday. Bored with the adult world, he wanders outside to indulge his hobby of creating in elongating coins by placing them on train tracks. Doyon has said that the film is inspired by his youth in Desbiens, Quebec.[6]
