Sisir Roy (Soumitra Chatterjee) is a 72-year-old man, long retired from a government office as Upper Division Clerk. His family consists of his son Prasanta (Bhaskar Banerjee) and daughter-in-law Mandira (Soma Chakrabarty). Sisir's wife died many years ago. Everyday, Sisir goes to the park and interacts with different people. Over a period of time, five young people become acquainted with him. Ahana (Sohini Sarkar), a newly married girl, restless and immature, who repeatedly flees from her in-law's place, much to the anxiety of people close to her. Her newly married husband Prasit (Gourab Chakrabarty) is quite baffled about her behaviour and is desperately on the lookout for a solution. Saswata (Kaushik Sen) is a 35-year-old man who teaches Mathematics in a boys' school. For the last eleven years, he has been entrusted to teach Calculus. Saswata has no thrill in life and is desperately in search of that. Sananda (Radhika Apte), a 30-year-old IT engineer, is a single mother of a 3-year old child. Sananda has a dreadful past, which keeps haunting her. Biswanath (Rahul) is a typist who sits on one side of the park, quite aware that the number of customers is rapidly dwindling as more and more people prefer electronic type using computers, but he does not have the means to buy a computer. Reena (Nina Chakrabarty) is a young girl, working at a petrol pump, who is struggling against an uncertain future and insecurity. All these five people are either going through or on the verge of a crisis in their lives. In midst of such a situation, Sisir's son and daughter-in-law leave for Meerut. And now Sisir is left completely alone. Detached from his own kin, Sisir now reaches out to his extended family by involving himself more intimately with the four new people in his life. He touches upon their minds trying to change their thoughts, and in turn, their lives. But in the process, he puts his own life into a vortex of complexities.[1]
