Love In Vegas (Love in the Big City 3)

Since the events described in the second part five years have passed. The heroes of the film settled down: they have expensive cars, nice apartments, successful careers, happy families. But the trouble is Alisa, Nastya and Katya begin to get tired of the annoying everyday life, because all day they are engaged in the upbringing of children and household.
While mothers are completely occupied by their children, the fathers have the opportunity to distract themselves at work and during rare bar visits. They work all day, and on weekends they sleep or make small family walks, turning their life into a routine.
To break the vicious circle, the heroes will have to seriously change their lives and an old friend comes to help them â€” Saint Valentine (Philip Kirkorov).
