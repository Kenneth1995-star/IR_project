Thuruppu Gulan

Mr. Menon (Devan), a multi-millionaire, buys considerable real estate and entrusts it to one of his trusted lieutenants, Sreedharan Unnithan (Kalashala Babu), to construct a 5-star hotel. He also buys a small plot adjacent to the 5 star hotel and gives it to Kochuthoma (Innocent), Kunjumon's (Mammootty) father to construct a small tea and snack restaurant. Menon leaves for Singapore and Kunjumon is packed off to Calicut by his father, as he fears that his son's life might be in danger as he badly wounded one of the local goons who picked up a fight with Menon. Unnithan fails in forcing Kochuthoma to vacate the land since the restaurant is damaging the reputation of the 5 star hotel. Using his political influence Unnithan jails Kunjumon and Kochuthoma.
After a few years, Menon decides to return to his native land and get his daughter married off in a good way. But Sreedharan Unnithan and his sons, in an effort to foil his plans, have him framed in a cooked up case and get Menon imprisoned. His daughter, Lakshmi (Sneha) reaches Kerala to find a way to help her father. She meets up with the hero Gulaan Kunjumon, the hero of the Calicut Market. To avenge his imprisonment Kunjumon leases the bar in the 5 star hotel through Swamy and spoils the hotel reputation. With many twists and turns and a lot of misunderstandings, it becomes clear that Kunjumon aka Gulan is the son of Kochuthoma, and Kunjumon finally realizes that Lakshmi is the daughter of Menon, not Unnithan.
