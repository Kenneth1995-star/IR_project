The Moonshine War

A man John "Son" Martin makes moonshine whiskey, owning and operating a profitable still in Prohibition-era Kentucky. One day, he gets a visit from an old Army acquaintance, Frank Long, who is now an Internal Revenue agent.
Frank is willing to look the other way in exchange for a percentage of Son's business. But when he is unable to persuade Son to cut him in on the profits, or even reveal where the moonshine is hidden, Frank sends for the dangerous Dr. Emmett Taulbee, who uses more violent methods in getting what he wants.
Emmett and his henchmen go too far, killing Sheriff Baylor, and even Emmett's girlfriend when she tries to get away. Frank can see that he made a mistake, so he volunteers to help Son fend off the gang. Still out numbered, Son finally tells Emmett's men where the moonshine is buried in exchange for his life. But when the crooks start digging, they set off Son's buried dynamite instead.
