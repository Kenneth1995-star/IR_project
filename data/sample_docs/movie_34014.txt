Congkak

Kazman is a dedicated husband who, despite his wife Sufiah's protests, decided to buy a bungalow for their family near a lake as a family getaway. Whenever she is in the new house, Sufiah feels as if someone is watching her. At night, Sufiah and Kazman's daughter Lisa goes downstairs to play congkak with someone whom only she can see. Lisa's invisible friend compounds Sufiah's uneasiness about the new house. Sufiah throws the congkak in the lake, but is awakened the next night by the sound of the congkak being played again. Sufiah gets up to investigate the congkak sound, and sees an old lady playing it. Soon afterward, Lisa disappears, and the oldest resident in that area, Pak Tua, comes to the family's rescue and helps to locate the missing girl.
