Basement

A group of people gets stuck in a basement parking for the night. At the onset, some are irritated and just can’t wait to go home, while some don’t even give a damn, knowing they can easily come out the next day. But when the power is shut off and as it gets close to midnight, strange things start to happen.
It all starts with one death. Followed by another and another. They don’t really witness the killings, but they hear the screaming, and they see the bloodied bodies thereafter, making them fear for their lives.
As the night unfolds, they soon realize they’re not dealing with an ordinary being. There’s an evil creature stuck inside the basement with them. But what kind of creature is this? And how can they fight it? [4]
