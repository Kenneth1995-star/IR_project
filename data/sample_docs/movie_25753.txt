Ghar Ki Izzat

Ram Kumar is the eldest of four sons in his family. He has brought up his three younger brothers, Shyam, Sohan, and Mohan, with love and fatherly care, together with his wife, Sita. Sita has a younger sister, Gita, who also lives with them, and is a child-widow. Ram does not approve of anyone referring to Gita as such. Ram decides that it is time for Shyam and Sohan to get married, and he picks their brides for them. Shyam marries Mona, and Sohan marries Sheela. With the entry of these two new wives, the equilibrium of love and respect is disrupted, as both want more control and demand more respect, which leads to clashes and quarrels all round, and changes in the lives of all the inhabitants.[8]
