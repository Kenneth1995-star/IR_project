Parvathy (Bhama) is a girl who lost her mother at birth. She is brought up by herfriend Lekshmi's (Divya) mother in their Agraharam. Both of them enroll in a music college, where Parvathy falls in love with Devanand (Vineeth), her lecturer.
One day Devananth’s grandfather decides to get in touch with Agraharam in order to propose a marriage between Parvathy and Devanand. When he reaches Lekshmi’s house, Lekshmi's mother cleverly fixes the marriage of Devanand with Lekshmi instead of Parvathy. On learning that Parvathy is pregnant with Devanand's child, Parvathy's father commits suicide. Parvathy's now surviving relative is a rowdy lorry driver (Anoop Menon). To escape his clutches she runs away from the Agraharam. She is chased by hooligans and is rescued by a lady (scrap dealer).
Lekshmi goes on a pilgrimage after 2 years of marriage (It is from this point that the film actually begins, and then the above story is told in flashback), and finds Parvathy begging with a baby in Palani and notifies her relatives. Meanwhile, the lorry driver comes with police escorts and forces Parvathy to leave with him. Lorry driver takes her to a place where a musical concert is taking place. Devanand was performing there. Parvathy is reunited with her love. The film ends with Devanand, Parvathy and their child going on a pilgrimage. Lekshmi is also there in the same bus.
