Gandhi Pirantha Mann

Rukmani (Ravali) is pampered and brought up by her father Periyavar (Radha Ravi) and four uncles. Balu (Vijayakanth) manages to get married with Rukmani by hiding the truth. Balu tells her the reason why he marries her.
Gandhi (Vijayakanth), Balu's father, and Lakshmi (Revathi), Balu's mother, were kind-hearted teachers and were transferred to a village. Gandhi and Lakshmi were determined to abolish the caste system in school. Soon, they clashed with Periyavar and his four brothers. They finally killed the innocent Gandhi.
Balu is now determined to eradicate the caste hatred in Periyavar's village. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
