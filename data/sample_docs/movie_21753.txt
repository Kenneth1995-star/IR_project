The Hounds of Notre Dame

The Hounds of Notre Dame is about 36 hours in the life of PÃ¨re Athol Murray, a hard-drinking, chain-smoking Catholic priest, teacher, political activist and coach of the school hockey team, The Hounds. Peacocke gives a powerful performance as Murray, who defies his superior and gives anti-CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) speeches in 1940s Saskatchewan. The film received outstanding reviews and Peacocke won a Genie Award for best actor, but it received only limited distribution and came to symbolize the problems inherent in producing quality Canadian features.[1]
