His and Hers

While researching his latest novel "I Conquered the Desert" in North Africa, Reggie Blake (Terry-Thomas) finds himself lost in the desert. Rescued by a Bedouin tribe, and finally shipped home, Reggie enthusiastically adopts Bedouin dress and customs, much to the frustration of his wife (Janette Scott). Fran declares herself unnable to live with him, so they split their home down the middle. There is further drama when Reggie's publisher (Wilfrid Hyde-White) rejects his new novel out of hand.
