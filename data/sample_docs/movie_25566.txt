Jai Shiv Shankar

This is a story of three men; first is Jai, frank and fearless journalist and crusader, for whom the most dangerous of swords, guns, or bombs are no match. He may lay down his life, but will not compromise with the ultimate truth. The second one is Shiva, violent angry man, who has been branded by the society as an anti-social element but is, in fact, a victim of the circumstances in his life.
There is a silver streak beneath his terrorist exterior and his lifestyle is a phenomenon by itself. And the third one is Shanker, who has been directed into forbidden paths of life by those elements who are a curse on society, for furthering their own interest. However, when he realized his mistake, he takes them on, one after another, and exposes them in public. And when these three youths Jai, Shiv and Shankar join hands and launch a tirade against evil, the murky world of sin, tyranny, and oppression shudders and the society looks up to the new awakening.
There is also an honest and upright Government officer Pooja, who succumbs to the pressure of red-tapism in bureaucracy. Then there is Priya, who is the gift to future of healthy society. "Jai, Shiv, Shankar" is thus a clash of ideas, between the perpetrator of oppression and the upholders of truth.
