Four Dimensions of Greta

Hans a young German journalist arrives in London to write an article about au-pair girls, but is requested by friends to investigate the whereabouts of their teenage daughter Greta. He interviews four individuals who all paint distinctly different pictures of the missing girl - each revealing a different aspect or dimension. These reminiscences constitute the film's 3-D sequences. Hans finally tracks down Greta and discovers she has been kidnapped by an East End gangster.[3][1]
