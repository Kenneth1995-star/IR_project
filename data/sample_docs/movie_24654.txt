Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayegi

Ye Raat Phir Na Aayegi is a rivetting film about a woman's two-centuries old skeleton mysteriously coming to life as Kiran, after it was excavated by Reeta and her assistant Rakesh from a site of archaeological interest. Amid the passage of these surreal events, Reeta and her widower father come to know that Kiran has resurfaced after two centuries to claim Suraj, her lover from the past life, who is presently engaged to Reeta as her fiance.
