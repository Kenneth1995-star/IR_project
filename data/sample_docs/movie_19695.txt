Siege of the Saxons

King Arthur learns one of his knights is plotting to take over and marry his daughter. Soon the soldiers of double-dealing Edmund of Cornwall slay the king. However his daughter Katherine escapes with the help of outlaw Robert Marshall. Claiming she is dead Edmund makes ready to usurp the throne in league with Saxon invaders.
After coming close to death more than once at the hands of the sinister limping man, Katherine and Robert and other loyal countrymen rescue the great wizard Merlin from the hands of Edmund's men to help them save Camelot and England. They arrive at Camelot just as Edmund is about to be crowned. On Merlin's advice, Robert challenges Edmund to kill him as a traitor using Arthur's sword Excalibur.
Edmund is unable to draw the sword from the scabbard, whereupon Robert presents the sword to Katherine, the rightful heir, who draws it out easily. Katherine is recognised by the court as the new Queen, and following a battle against Edmund's remaining men and the invading force of Saxons, Katherine's armies prevail and she offers the lands of Edmund and other renegades to Robert so that he can rule alongside her as King.
