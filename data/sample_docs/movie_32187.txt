Pasupathi plays the game in such a way that Dharmayya Naidu is forced to give granite quarry as a dowry to Pasupathi's family, due to which Dharmayya Naidu's daughter commits suicide. When Samba comes to know the reason behind his sister's suicide, he occupies the quarry and kills Pasupathi's brothers. Pasupathi kills everybody in Samba's house in retaliation.

The rest of the story is all about how he returns to Seema and takes vengeance against Pasupathi and then starts serving in educational field.
