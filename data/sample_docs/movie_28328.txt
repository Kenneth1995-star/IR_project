Idiots

Sanusha plays a rich heiress who hires a killer called Beeran (Vijayaraghavan) to murder her and implicate her two-timing boyfriend for the crime. Beeran, a novice, gives the contract to Freddy (Baburaj), a juice stall owner who owes Beeran money. As the girl waits for the killer to arrive, a thief (Asif Ali) breaks into her apartment. This launches a series of comical incidents that go on until the next morning.
