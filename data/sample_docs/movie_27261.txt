Amruthavarshini

Hemanth (Sharath Babu) and Veena (Suhasini) are a happily engaged couple with Hemanth working for an advertisement firm. One day, Abhishek Bharadwaj (Ramesh Aravind), a poet and Hemanth's childhood friend, visits them. Abhishek is depressed as his girlfriend Shruti (Nivedita Jain) died due to cancer. Shruthi had made Abhishek promise that he will marry another girl after her death. Abhishek becomes obsessed with Veena as she has a strong resemblance with Shruthi. Hemanth comes to know about this but doesn't reveal this to Veena. Hemanth takes Abhi to a cliff and ask him to change his mind and go back home. Abhi tries to kill Hemanth by letting the jeep down the hill, the jeep hits Hemanth and he falls off the cliff. Abhi does not try to save him even though he could have, when Hemanth was hanging by the cliff. Hemanth's automatic camera captures of the whole episode. When Veena accidentally sees those pictures, she understands what really has happened on that day. She pretends to have moved on and suggests that she is ready to share her life with Abhishek. She asks him to take her to the cliff where Hemanth died as it was Hemanth's long cherished dream to take photos from the cliff. She confronts him, revealing that she knows what had happened and shows him those pictures of that day. She then commits suicide from that cliff, in front of Abhishek, as a revenge.
