Raja (Raja) is a CID inspector of police who is charged to solve the murder of the smuggler Durai. The only clue he would have is that the killer rode a white horse, wore a monster mask and a black coat. Raja falls in love with the soft-spoken college student Raani (Vineetha). He then meets the tomboy Jhansi fighting with some goons. She looks a lot like Raani and she reveals that she is her twin sister. The same killer murders the smuggler Maruthu (Alex). Finally, Raja finds the killer who turns out to be Raani who is also Jhansi.
In the past, Sub-inspector Ramachandran (Delhi Ganesh) was an honest police officer. He lived happily with his two daughtersÂ : Lakshmi (Vahini) and Raani. One day, he faced the smuggler Manikkam who severely injured his leg. Lakshmi became a school teacher. Manikkam and his associates Maruthu and Durai spread terror among the villagers. One day, Lakshmi ridiculed and slapped Manikkam. The vengeful Manikkam, Maruthu and Durai raped Lakshmi in her school in broad daylight. Lakshmi, Raani and Ramachandran lodged a complaint against the rapists but the court discharged them. Lakshmi immediately committed suicide in the court. Raani and Ramachandran decided to take revenge on the rapists.
Raani is now determined to kill Manikkam before Raja and the police catch her.
