Venkatadri Express

The film focusses on a family living in Hyderabad whose head is Ram Murthy (Nagineedu), a retired head master. He is a disciplined person and always tries to make his relatives behave in the same way. To avoid bad remarks from the society about his family, he sets up a family constitution of discipline. His mania for discipline is such big that if any one of his family members commit 100 Mistakes, that person would be banished from the family and that mistake can be anything which Ram Murthy hates which ironically includes laughing out loudly. Thus all of the family members maintain a disciplinary life to avoid being banished from the house. In detail, the family consists of Ram Murthy's wife Seetha, an Asthma patient; his daughter Kasthuri, his son in law Anand and their kids. Apart from them are Ram Murthy's two sons Brahmaji (Brahmaji) and Sundeep (Sundeep Kishan). Since Ram Murthy's brother Subrahmanyam (Prithviraj) was alleged to be committed 100 Mistakes though he didn't, he is sent away from home. While all of the family members commit mistakes less than 20, Sundeep commits 99 Mistakes and one more, he is out of the family. So to avoid that Sundeep starts leading a careful life. Brahmaji's marriage is scheduled at Tirupathi and the whole family boards Venkatadri Express at Kacheguda. Sundeep's mother forgot the Mangala sutra at the house and Sundeep goes away to bring it back. Moreover, to his convenience, Sundeep is in S4 while others are in S3. So Sundeep goes outside the station and waits for an Auto-Rickshaw, But none accepts to go to his area. Meanwhile, a miser techie Prarthana (Rakul Preet Singh) reaches Kachiguda railway station to board the Venkatadri Express and the Auto-Rickshaw driver goes to bring the change in order to pay her off the balance amount after receiving the fare. Sundeep gets into the vehicle and goes to his home. He breaks the house's lock with a stone as he has no keys to open it. He takes the Mangala sutra and goes back to Kachiguda Railway Station. Prarthana catches yet another auto and reaches to the station. There she pays off the fares of both the vehicles and goes to board the train.
Meanwhile, a passenger Dasthagiri (Sapthagiri) asks Sundeep to take care of his bag till he gets into the train after buying a water bottle and Sundeep accepts it. They both save each other's Mobile numbers so that Sundeep can give a missed call to Dasthagiri if the train leaves the station and due to that, Dasthagiri would board the train. However a tiffin vendor and a customer quarrel. Sundeep in order to avoid committing the 100th mistake keeps quiet. The story shifts to next day morning around 9:30 in the Morning at Tirupathi Railway Station. Ram Murthy and his entire family travel in two cars which are led by two baaraat bands. Ram Murthy, Seetha, Kasthuri and her younger son travel in one car and Sundeep, Brahmaji, Anand, Anand's son Nikhil and their servant travel in another car. Sundeep's shirt has Blood stains and when Anand, Brahmaji ask the reasons for the stains, Sundeep narrates the story which happened in the past 12 hours. To compromise and stop a quarrel, Sundeep gets down from the train and starts speaking with the aggrieved persons. Prarthana misguides the customer that Sundeep is a Robber and goes along with the customer to complain on Sundeep. Meanwhile, Sundeep is thanked by the tiffin vendor. But to Sundeep's misfortune, Venkatadri Express leaves the platform. So with the help of the tiffin vendor's friend and goods transporter Audi short for Aunimutyam (Thagubothu Ramesh), Sundeep goes to Shadnagar. While Sundeep reaches Shadnagar, Audi goes to the nearby Bar and quarrels with the local police calling their brandy as cheap liquor.
