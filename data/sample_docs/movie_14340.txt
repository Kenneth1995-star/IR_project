Pieces of April

April Burns, the eldest daughter in a highly dysfunctional family, lives in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with her boyfriend Bobby. Although estranged from her family, she opts to invite them for Thanksgiving dinner, probably the last for her mother Joy, who has breast cancer.
The film focuses on three journeys: the family's arduous trek from suburbia to New York City; April's preparations for the meal, made much more difficult when she discovers her oven is broken; and Bobby's efforts to find a suit so he can make a good impression on his girlfriend's relatives. During the family's journey, we learn about Joy and April's relationship - and, in a crucial moment, we see an insight Joy gains about her relationship with her daughter. During April's journey, she meets many of her neighbors and establishes city-family relationships with them, as we see during the final meal. Bobby's journey ends with a return to the gathering that is an exact capture of White America's stereotypes of black men.
All these journeys tie together in the final scenes of reconciliation and hope for the future.
