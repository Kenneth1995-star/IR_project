In the Fog

The film is an adaptation from Vasilâ€™ Bykaw's short story. The action is set in 1942 on the territory of Belarus occupied by the German army. The Germans face strong resistance from the Partisans and hatred of local people. The Partisans suspect Sushenya, a track-walker, of collaboration with the Nazis because he was first arrested and then suddenly released after they had blown up a German train. Two of them capture Sushenya and lead him to the forest where they are going to shoot him as a traitor. They fall into a trap set by the Germans who severely wound one of the partisans. Sushenya attempts to save his executioner's life by carrying the wounded Partisan on his back to the nearest village. Nevertheless, Sushenya is under suspicion. He laments that he was a well-respected and trustworthy village resident, raising a family in peace, however the war changed that forever.
