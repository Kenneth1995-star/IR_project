Bead Game

A single bead multiplies into two beads. From there, they continue to expand, turning into Atoms which eventually transform into creatures. These creatures magically ingest each other then mutate into other mythical beings. For example, a monster eats a dinosaur then transforms into a seal. This sequence displays how creatures deal with conflict without the control of brain power.
As the cycle continues, the beads eventually turn into humans. The chronological arrangement demonstrates how civilization has dealt with conflict inspired by creatures of the past, only now, with the advancement of technology in terms of the weapons used. For example, in its earliest sequence, it shows humans blasting cannons into enemy territory. It then moves on to humans shooting rifles during war.
The entirety of the short film is based on how different time periods dealt with competition, this this case, it is displayed through malicious actions shown through the evolution of the beads.
To accentuate the seemingly unbroken chain of evolution over centuries, Patel chose to film the beads themselves growing in a constant flow of movement into larger and more complex creatures and images, with the camera continuously zooming out to accommodate the escalation; this requires him to film on a continual basis without deviating from whatever path he had taken once filming began, and cuts had to be kept to an absolute minimum.[6]
