Soggadu

Ravi (Tarun), a school dropout and vagabond, falls in love with Swati (Arti Agarwal) the minute he sets his eyes on her, but loses sight of her in a sea of people and traffic. As only a possessed lover can, he tries to find her in a city of ten million people. Armed with just the first three letters on the license plate of her car, he tries to find her whereabouts. After tumultuous attempts and near hits and misses, he manages to find her. Swati lived under the shadow of a tyrannical brother who was trying to get her married. Ravi manages to establish visual contact with Swathi and understands from her mute plight that she wanted to leave home. Ravi helps her escape home and is elated to know that she left home for him. His bubble quickly bursts when he comes to know that Swati had used his help to get to her lover Chandu (Jugal Hansraj). Ravi braves the goons who chase them, fights the tears of heartbreak, and decides to help Swathi meet her lover. This draws ire from Ravi's friends who had helped him all along in his love story. They think Ravi should dump the girl. He disagrees and they desert him. Armed only with unflinching, selfless love, Ravi embarks on an adventure with Swathi to find her lover Chandu. Finally, he manages to fight the goons of Swathi's brother and unites Swathi and Chandu. Ravi's selfless sacrifice melts Swathi's heart and makes her wonder what true love was.
