Passage Home

Captain Lucky Ryland (Peter Finch) is about to retire. There is a flashback of several years to a voyage on a ship he was captaining from South America. He is forced to give a lift to a British governess, Ruth Elton (Diane Cilento), who is returning home. Both Ryland and his first mate, Vosper (Anthony Steel), fall for Ruth. Ryland proposes to Ruth but when she turns down his offer he tries to rape her and she is rescued by Vosper.
There is a subplot about the dissatisfaction of the ship's crew with the supply of potatoes. The potatoes are dumped overboard and Ryland is determined to find out who is responsible. It turns out this was done by Ike the bosun (Geoffrey Keen), who later dies at sea.
