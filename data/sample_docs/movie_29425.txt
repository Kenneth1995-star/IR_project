Poova Thalaiya

Gemini Ganesan is a widower and S. Varalaxmi is his mother in law. Jaishankar is the younger brother of Gemini Ganesan and he falls in love with S. Varalaxmi's youngest daughter Venniradai Nirmala. A healthy competition takes place between evil minded S. Varalaxmi and Jai Shankar so as to overthrow one another.
