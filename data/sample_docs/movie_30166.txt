Parijatham's mother Pattamma wanted a son-in-law who will let Parijatham dance after the marriage. She finally got married with another folk dancer Palanisamy (Sivakumar). Palanisamy's brother Kottaisamy (Selva) was a good for nothing young man who spent his time with Kattamuthu (Goundamani). Later, Parijatham changed Kottaisamy into a responsible person. He got married with the folk dancer Mala (Abhirami). Rumors around Parijatham and the rich landlord Naicker (Vinu Chakravarthy) became more intense. Palanisamy could not bear this rumor and split up with the pregnant Parijatham. One day, Kattamuthu's sister was raped by a rich landlord, she then committed suicide and Kottaisamy ridiculed the rapist in public.
