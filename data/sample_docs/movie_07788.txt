The Terror

In 1806, Andre Duvalier, a French soldier lost in the Confederation of the Rhine, is saved by Helene, a young woman who bears a resemblance to Ilsa von Leppe, the wife of the Baron von Leppe who died twenty years before. Andre sets out to investigate Helene's true identity and, in doing so, learns the Baron's darkest secret: After he found Ilsa with another man, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed her lover.
Over the last two years, the Baron has been tormented by Ilsa's ghost, who has beseeched him to kill himself so they could be together. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so and atone for his crimes. Unbeknownst to him, Ilsa's ghost is being commanded to haunt him by a peasant witch named Katrina.
After preventing the Baron from killing himself, Andre and Stefan, the Baron's majordomo, capture Katrina and force her into compliance. Katrina then reveals herself to be the mother of a man named Eric, whom she believes the Baron killed twenty years before and hopes to avenge by damning his soul to hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that the Baron died twenty years earlier and that Eric took his place, living his life until he deluded himself into thinking he was the true Baron von Leppe.
Realizing her error too late, Katrina goes with Andre and Stefan to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt. Katrina's pact with the Devil, however, makes her unable to walk on consecrated ground and she ends up burning to death after being struck by lightning.
At the von Leppe castle, Eric floods the crypt as Ilsa's ghost attempts to kill him and Stefan struggles to stop her. By the time Andre gains access to the crypt, it is already starting to cave in and he is only able to save Helene. The two share a moment outside the castle before Helene turns into a rotting corpse.
