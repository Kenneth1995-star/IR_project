4 the People

Vivek (Bharath), Aravind (Arun), Eshwar (Arjun Bose) and Shafeek (Padma Kumar) are four angry engineering students who cannot stand the corruption in society. They take the law into their own hands and they form the secretive clique called 4 The People (their dress code is black and everything about them is black) that takes out corrupt officials. They have a website where the public can lodge their complaints. Soon the police are on their track. A young cop (Narain) is in hot pursuit of the gang. In a racy climax the foursome attempt to kill the Minister but fail. Seeing the brutality of the police the students come to the support of the foursome. One of the students kills the minister and is joined by three more students. They escape due to the support of students. The revolution continues.
