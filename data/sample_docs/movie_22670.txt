A Wedding Invitation

High school sweethearts Qiao Qiao and Li Xing are about to graduate from university when Li Xing surprises Qiao Qiao with a marriage proposal. Qiao Qiao, however, declines the proposal, offering rash arguments as to why she's not ready. Little does he know, Qiao Qiao has a devastating secret. Nonetheless, they write a breakup agreement; if they're both single in five years, they'll get married. They part ways and five years pass. Believing Li Xing is still waiting for her, Qiao Qiao waits patiently for his call. But when Li Xing finally does contact her it's to invite her to his wedding. Qiao Qiao is flabbergasted and is determined to win her former flame back at any cost, even though the secret that forced them apart lingers.
