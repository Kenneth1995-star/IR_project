Shaurya

Major Siddhant Chaudhary (Rahul Bose) and Major Akash Kapoor (Javed Jaffrey) are lawyers in the Indian Army and are close friends. They are on opposite sides of a case where a soldier Captain Javed Khan (Deepak Dobriyal) kills his commanding officer Major Rathod (Pankaj Tripathi). The accused is mysteriously silent and not willing to talk about the incident. Siddhant, who is the defense counsel, is apathetic at first but starts taking a keen interest in the case after meeting Kavya (Minissha Lamba), a journalist who demonstrates that the case is not as simple as it seems. The underlying theme in the movie is Siddhant's gradual understanding of what Shaurya means (his father was himself a decorated army veteran), and the resulting conflict with Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh (Kay Kay Menon). In the End, It is revealed that Maj. Rathod, while conducting a search operation in a village, roughed up and killed a villager, and threatened a little girl without any fear because he had backing from Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh. Enraged and fearing for the girl's life, Capt. Javed shot him. The movie ends with a climax where eventually, Capt. Javed is acquitted of his charges and given back his honor, as a result of which, he is back in service with full ranks and respect and a criminal case is filed against Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh.
