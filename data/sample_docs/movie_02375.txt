Danger on the Air

Nan Grey, as Christina "Steenie" MacCorkle, a radio advertising executive, is suspected of murdering her client, Berton Churchill, as Caesar Kluck, a soda magnate.
Loathed by all who met him, or forced to work, with his underhanded business machinations, the victims, and suspects, start piling up. Including thug, Joe Downing, as Gangster Joe Carney; Lee J. Cobb as Tony Lisotti, trying to protect his daughter, Louise Stanley, as Maria Lisotti, from being another notch on Kluck's belt; and, Peter Lind Hayes, as Harry Lake, who is desperate to get on the air, seemingly at any cost.[1]
It's up to radio engineer Donald Woods, as Benjamin Franklin Butts, and "Steenie's" brother, Frank Milan, as Alexander MacCorkle, to try to clear her, before the real murderer gets rid of another victim; unless, of course, it is one of them. Time is running out.[2]
The novel contains footnotes, which are intended to be both funny and informative, as well as further commentary on the nature and philosophy of radio and broadcasting, than there is time for the movie to encompass.[3] The novel's author Xanthippe, was the pseudonym of Edith Meiser who wrote and produced extensively for radio.[4] She is particularly known for her work on radio with the Sherlock Holmes mysteries.
