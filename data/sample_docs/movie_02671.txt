Smashing the Money Ring

A counterfeit money ring is being run from prison by a gangster, Dice Matthews, and a casino owner, Steve Parker, who is behind bars for slugging a cop. Law enforcement agent Brass Bancroft goes undercover as a convict, getting help on the outside from his right-hand man, Gabby, while infiltrating the counterfeiting ring.
Parker's daughter, Peggy, becomes involved, identifying a guard who's also in on the scheme after her father is murdered. Bancroft and Matthews make a break for it, but although the guard shoots both, Bancroft recovers and sees that justice is done.
