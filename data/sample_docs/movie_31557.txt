Santosham

Zamindar Dayanidhi (R. Nagendra Rao) is a crooked, cruel, greedy and a huge miser whose profession is to roll the destitute by giving loans and takes the authority on them. Unable to repay the money he has borrowed from Zamindar for his son Anand’s (N.T.Rama Rao) higher studies, Sundaraiah (Vadlamani Viswanathan) commits suicide. A depressed Anand makes an aborted bid to kill the Zamindar and on the same night, he along with his friend Madan Mohan (Jaggaiah) stumbles upon the corpse of an England-returned rich young man Paramanand (again N. T. Rama Rao) resembles Anand. On Mohan’s advice, Anand takes his place. The dead man’s blind mother (Kakinada Rajaratnam) believes that Anand is her son and performs his marriage with Dayanidhi’s class-conscious daughter Sarasa (Jamuna). Dayanidhi objects to his son Murthy (Ramasarma) marrying their servant-maid Amrutham (Anjali Devi) and tries to kill her by torching her hut. How Anand saves Amrutham, tames Sarasa and brings in a change of heart in Dayanidhi forms the rest of the story.
