Kisan Kanya

Kisan Kanya was based on a novel by Saadat Hasan Manto[6] and focussed on the plight of poor farmers.[6] The story revolved on the life of a poor peasant Ram (Nisar) who was being ill-treated by his landlord Ghani.[9] Eventually, Ghani is murdered and Ram becomes the prime suspect in the eyes of the public.[9] The film performed moderately at the box-office.[6]
