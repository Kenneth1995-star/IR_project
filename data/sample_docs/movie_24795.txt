Caravan

The film is an action thriller about a young woman, Sunita (Asha Parekh) and her father Mohandas (Murad), who finds out that his trusted employee, Rajan (Krishen Mehta), has been embezzling money from him. He confronts him and Rajan attacks him, flinging him out of the window of the multi-storied building, but the police think that the death was accidental. This leaves the coast clear for Rajan to wed Mohandas' only daughter, Sunita. Sunita is distraught and ends up married to this "wrong" man, Rajan. Shortly after the wedding, Sunita finds out the truth. She thinks that Rajan has conspired with his girlfriend Monica (Helen) to murder her. So she runs away to find her father's old friend in Bangalore, who may be able to help. On the way, she experiences an accident and ends up with a band of performing gypsies. She meets caravan van-driver Mohan (Jeetendra) and she is attracted towards him. Sunita does not know that she has put herself in danger again - this time at the hands of knife-thrower, Nisha (Aruna Irani), who loves Mohan, and will kill anyone who gets in her way. To make matters worse, Rajan has not given up his search for Sunita.
