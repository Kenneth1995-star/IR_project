Sandhippoma

Vishwa (Suriya) and Nilani (Preetha Vijayakumar) fall in love. Her mother doesn't approve, but goes along with it. Complications arise when Vishwa exhibits "fashion" photos he's taken of Nilani, which further upsets Nilani's mother. Then it comes to light that Surya's father (Prakash Raj) had an affair, and things take a dramatic, tragic turn for the lovers. In the end, both families arrive at airport to prevent Nilani from boarding the flight, but to their bad luck, they could not stop it. Nilani commits suicide by swallowing poison from her ring and Vishwa, who gets hit by a wall, turns mentally challenged with the behavior of a child.
