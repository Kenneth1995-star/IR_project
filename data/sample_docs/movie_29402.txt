Moondrezhuthu

The film revolves around a big box filled with cash and jewellery and a bunch of people eying for it. One of them is a greedy old man with a long tuft (S.A. Asokan), whose daughter is the heroine Jayalalithaa. A manager (Major Sundararajan) is trusted with the box which needs to be handed over to its legitimate claimants (Sriranjani Jr and her suffering family). In his efforts to deliver the box to the rightful owners he is forced to kill and is sent to jail. His son, the film’s hero Ravichandran, to whom he narrates the events, buries the treasure in a village, and writes down the clues to find it in three different pieces of paper, with three different Tamil alphabets, Thi... Mu... Ka.
After many twists and turns, the three villains decipher that the Tamil letters are a clue to the name of the village where the box is buried — Kamuthi — and go there. Now, the land is in the possession of a factory coming up in its place, and another villain (Manohar) also goes after the treasure by killing the others with earth-moving equipment. How the hero assisted by Nagesh deals with this forms the rest of the story.
At the end, the villains are exposed and the box is handed over to its rightful owners. The lovers, Jayalalithaa and Ravichandran, are united too.[3]
