Gokuladasi

Kamaroopan (Honnappa Bhagavathar) is a lustful king who faces the curse of Goddess Parvati and is reborn as a common jeweller in the town of Gokulam. The jeweller happens to set his eyes on a Devadasi named Anuradha (Rajamma) and tries to woo her. Anuradha on the other hand, was a singer-dancer in her previous birth and a devotee of Parvati. She was cursed by sage Narada (Honnappa Bhagavathar) for displeasing him and is reborn as Anuradha. The jeweller keeps trying to seduce Anuradha not realising the actions he had committed in his previous birth. To settle the matter, Krishna (Padmini) rids both the jeweller and the Devadasi of their curses.[2]
