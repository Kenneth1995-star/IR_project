Taurus

The second film of the director-conceived cinema theater about the decline of power, started by the film Moloch. In the face of illness, the historical personality turns out to be simply a man powerless to change anything not only in the fate of a country that is not yet under his control, but also in the fate of his doomed awkward family, and in the fate of his decaying personality.
