Gridiron Flash

Belford College's football team is so bad, unscrupulous benefactor Howard Smith recruits a jailed thief, Tommy "Cherub" Burke, after seeing him play with a football in the prison yard.
Tommy's parole is arranged. He joins the team, alienating other students with his behavior so much that Jane Thurston from the registrar's office takes a personal interest, unaware of his criminal history. The team wins every game but Tommy gets restless and wants to join a gang. Smith persuades him to rob the jewels of a rich couple, Mr. and Mrs. Fields, and split the loot.
Tommy commits the theft but gets a guilty conscience after being bribed to lose the team's final game. He returns the stolen gems and gets back to campus in time to lead Belford to one final triumph.
