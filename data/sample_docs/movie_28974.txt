Gnana Soundari (Gemini)

The story was adapted from a Christian folk lore. Nawab Rajamanickam Pillai conducted it as a successful stage play for several years. Gnanam is the only daughter of King Dharmar. From her childhood she is an ardent devotee of Mother Mary. She is ill-treated by her step mother. She grows into a beautiful young girl and becomes Gnana Soundari. The step mother plans to kill her while the king was away. Arranged by the step mother, Gnana Soundari is taken to a forest by goons. However, instead of killing her, the goons amputate both her arms and abandon her. A prince from a neighbouring state comes to the forest for hunting and finds Gnana Soundari. He rescues and then falls in love with her. In spite of his father's objection the prince marries Gnana Soundari. But she has not divulged her true identity to him. Her father's kingdom is attacked by enemies and the Prince, as a neighbour, helps the father in fighting the enemies. The father (king) comes to know the whole story. Mother Mary restores the arms to Gnana Soundari.
