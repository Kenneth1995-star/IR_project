When they reach the home there is some preparations happening for an offering to a nearby temple in the form of a mythical dance form named karinkaliyattam(karie). They hand over some money to Dineshan’s father.The pardox is this money is used to conduct the dance as an offering to goddess to get a permanent visa in Gopu’s firm which Gopu can easily give if he decides.
