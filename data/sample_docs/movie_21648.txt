This Beautiful Fantastic

Bella Brown is a quirky girl with a unique past who works in a library while trying to write a childrenâ€™s book. She also hates plants, but as a condition of the lease on her house, she must maintain the garden. Her landlord becomes aware of her neglecting the garden and gives her one-month to fix the landscaping or face eviction. Along the way, she develops relationships with her curmudgeonly neighbor, his cook/housekeeper, and an inventor who frequents the library.
