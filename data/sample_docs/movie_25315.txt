Qaidi

Suraj lives in a small rural town in India with his widowed father, Yashpal, and a widowed sister, Sita. Suraj attends college, becomes a graduate and returns home to find that their family home is about to be auctioned at the behest of the cruel and influential Zamindar Bansilal, who refuses to allow them any more time to repay his outstanding loan. The auction takes place but is not enough to pay the loan, but Suraj assures them that he will do so when he gets a job in Bombay. Shortly thereafter, Yashpal kills himself; Sita is brutally killed, and an enraged Suraj tries to kill Bansilal, Sharma, and Raghu, he does manage to kill Raghu and Sharma, but Bansilal escapes and notifies the police, who locate, arrest Suraj, and have him sentenced to a long jail term. But Suraj escapes from prison and goes on the hunt for Bansilal. Before he could do that, he must first go through the police lines.
