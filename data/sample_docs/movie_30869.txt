Pandhayam

The story- A local thug and criminal who kills people like mosquitoes Masanam (Prakash Raj) slowly rises up the ranks to be a Minister. We have Shakthivel (Nithin Sathya) a die-hard fan of actor Vijay who studies in a city college. He falls in love with the wicked minister's sister Thulasi (Sindhu Tolani) and challenges him (he has a reason for that) and a cat and mouse game ensues. What follows is a series of incidents between the two that leads to a melodramatic climax.[1]
