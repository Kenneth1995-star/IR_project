Set in a medical college backdrop, the film is about a person (introvert), who loves his fellow college mate, but does not have courage to convey his love to her. The film has some memorable scenes, where the Hero wants to convey his Love, then he mistakes that the Heroine is in love with someone else (whereas, actually she is helping her sister and her lover to unite)
Finally, till the time he leaves the medical college, he does not convey his love to the lady and finally, by the time the lady understands his love, he becomes a heart patient himself, where he cannot digest a very happy or sad news.
The film is notable for its remarkable background score which gels with the story.
