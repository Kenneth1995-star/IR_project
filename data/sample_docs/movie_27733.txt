Raveendranath (Mammootty), a worker at Bhilai steel plant, leads a happy family life. His small family consists of Seetha (Lakshmi Gopalaswami), his north Indian wife, and Lakshmi and Chinnu, his two daughters. Ravi left his home in his teenage days after a scuffle with his father and has no connection with anyone back home. The sudden death of his colleague makes Ravi think about his roots and he makes a sudden visit to his house with his wife and kids.
At home, things have changed a lot in past 18 years. Rajendranath (Devan), his elder brother still isn't welcoming to Ravi due to a sibling abuse which resulted in parenting Suja. His younger brother Hari (Krishnakumar) and sister Sunanda (Bindu Panikker) are afraid that a part of the family property will be now handed over to Ravi. But Geetha (Sona Nair), another sister, is very happy to see him. After seeing him, the health of his mother (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) improves and she asks him to stay for the rest of her life knowing him not to be the cause of a heinous history in their family. In a short time, Ravi succeeds in winning the hearts of his siblings and leaves for Bhilai â€” this time taking his mother with him.
