Rosaappo Ravikkai Kaari

In pre-independent India, villager Sembattayan is a straightforward man who wants to come up in life. He marries Nandhini, an educated urban girl who comes to live with him in his village. Nandhini meets Manickam, an educated urban man and falls in love with him. The villagers begin gossiping about their extramarital affair, but Sembattayan refuses to believe them, instead berating those who accuse his wife. One day, when Sembattayan returns home, he finds Nandhini and Manickam in the same bed. Traumatised, he commits suicide by drowning himself in a pond. Nandhini's guilt causes her to do the same, and each person in the village speculates about the reason for the suicides differently.
