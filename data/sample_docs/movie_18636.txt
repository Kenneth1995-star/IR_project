The Butler's Dilemma

A group of friends undertake a number of deceptions in order to stage an illicit gambling party. Wimpish Rodney Playfair (Hearne) is persuaded, by a promise to erase his gambling debts, to impersonate an old manservant named Chapman (also played by Hearne) for a few weeks in order to unwittingly provide an alibi for an accomplished thief. Hearne's dual roles alternates between him playing the timid young Playfair, (in effect Hearne playing his real age) and the doddery butler 'Chapman', who is 'Mr Pastry' in all but name.
