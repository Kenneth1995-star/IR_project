Jayabheri

The story is set around 1600-1700 during the Vijayanagara empire. Kasinath Sastry (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is brought up by his elder brother Viswanath Sastry (Gummadi) and his wife Annapurnamma (Santha Kumari) like a son and he mastered classical music under Guru Viswambhara Sastry (Chittoor V Nagaiah). Bachanna Bhagavathulu Bangarayya (Relangi) & Narayya (Ramana Reddy) are performing at Vidyanagaram. Kasinath accepts the challenge posed by their star singer-dancer Manjuvani (Anjali Devi) and defeats her. His guru throws him out for sharing the stage with the low caste singer. Kasinath argues that music and literature have no boundaries like caste and creed. But the Dharmadhikari (Mukkamala) castigates him and his orthodox brother has no option but to send him away from home. Kasinath marries Manjuvani and the duo takes music to the common folks staging shows. King Vijayanandarama Vijayananda Ramagajapati (S. V. Ranga Rao) invites Kasinath to join his court. An irked Dharmadhikari plots with the court dancer Amruthamba (Rajasulochana) to defame Kasinath. Amrutha entices Kasinath and turns him into an alcoholic and forces the king to send him out. Rest of the story is how Annapurnamma intervenes facing the wrath of her husband and brings Kasinath back to his normal self-forms.
