Raspoutine

...Russia, 1916. Exhausted by the First World War, shaken by internal contradictions, the Russian Empire slowly and inexorably moves toward its collapse. Some of the well-born aristocrats and members of royal family decide that the only way to save the country is to expel the famous seer and healer Grigori Rasputin from St. Petersburg. This is a simple Russian man without any formal titles, but Rasputin is very friendly with the Emperor and his wife and has a huge impact on them.
Princess Zinaida Yusupova tries to explain to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna the harmfulness of her friendship with Rasputin, trying to prove that Rasputin terribly discredits not only the entire royal power, but also the Empress personally. But all this is in vain! Rasputin regularly cures the only son of the Empress from attacks of haemophilia, and therefore Alexandra never drives out "the holy elder". Seeing that her entreaties are useless, Princess Yusupova decides to act tough. And she persuades her son Felix to organize a plot to murder Rasputin...
