KK (Prem Chopra) and Durgen (Shakti Kapoor) were smugglers. Sikandra (Jeetendra) snatched the smuggled goods from both and distributed the money to the poor. Bajrangi (again Jeetendra), a village boy lived with his sister whose marriage had broken because of poverty. Bajrangi came to Mumbai with his sister to earn money. Sikandar died in an accident. After the death of Sikandar, Sunita and others recognized Bajrangi as Sikandar. But Bajrangi told Sunita the truth. Sunita trained Bajrangi in becoming Sikander. Bajrangi killed most of the people of Durgen and KK. Ultimately K.K. and Durgen plotted to kill Sikandar. Sikandar, with the help of the police attacked both of them and finally arrested KK and Durgen. Bajrangi married Sunita and lived happily ever after.
