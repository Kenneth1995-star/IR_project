Mary and Janaki are two look-alike women but they are not related to each other. Mary (Chandrakantha) is the daughter of a retired collector and Janaki (Chandrakantha, again) is from a middle class family. Mary is affianced to Thomas (V. Gopalakrishnan - Gopi), an army officer while Janaki is married to a company executive (A. V. M. Rajan). Janaki gives birth to a child. Janaki is found to have tuberculosis. So, her mother-in-law (S. N. Lakshmi) separates her from the child. In the meantime, Janaki's mother dies. The mother-in-law's adopted son Peter (Master Gopal) takes pity of the separated Janaki and her child. Accidentally he meets Mary, the look-alike of Janaki. Peter comes out with a clever plan and swaps Mary in place of Janaki. Several complications arise and finally the families are united.[1]
