Kaliyuga Kannan

Kaliyuga Kannan is a drama of faith and disbelief in God of a middle-aged couple. It tells of how the man is made to realise on becoming rich that God certainly does not neglect his faithful and wealth only brings sorrow and pain with it. He renounces all his wealth to his son and daughter-in-law and goes back to his old way of living.[1]
