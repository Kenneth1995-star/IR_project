The Shootout

Hon (Elvis Tsui), Hei, Koon and Bonnie (Kingdom Yuen) are a group of bank robbers who hijacked an armoured truck. Hon and Hei managed to escape from the cops while Koon and Bonnie encounter rookie cop Wong Ka-fai (Aaron Kwok), whom arrests Koon when he fell off his motorcycle. Knowing that one of his accomplices were arrested, Hon bursts into the police station and murders Koon to prevent divulgence of his crimes.
Since this case is serious, Ka-fai and his colleague Mei-san (Ngai Suet) were transferred to the Regional Crime Unit to assist in investigation, where they collaborate with Inpsector Lau (Sean Lau) and Ma (Bryan Leung), whom are frenemies. First, they investigate the armoured truck guards before finding clues that lead them to a karaoke bar, where Ka-fai falls in love with an innocent singer named Man (Fennie Yuen). Soon later, Ka-fai found clues about the hijack case from Man, who turns out to be Hon's girlfriend.
