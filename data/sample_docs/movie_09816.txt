Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen

Retired detective Charlie Chan is asked for his help by the San Francisco police to solve a new series of murders. This time his usual sidekick, Number One Son, has been replaced by Lee's own son, Lee Chan, Jr.
The prime suspect in the killings is a shady lady known as the Dragon Queen, but soon Chan's suspicions fall elsewhere. Among those at risk are Lee's maternal grandmother, Mrs. Lupowitz. Even though Charlie Chan's son is, as is usually the case, rarely accurate in reading clues, he has the full love and support of Cordelia, his beautiful fianc√©e.[2]
