Mili

Mili (Amala Paul) is an introvert who is very depressed. Her self-affectation and inferiority complex puts off everyone. Nobody likes her character but nobody attempts to help her either. She chooses to rise above the challenges and take back the reins of her life. Her transformation and learning to deal with her emotions, forms the crux of the movie. Nivin Pauly plays the role of Naveen, a soft-skills trainer who becomes a support for Mili.
