Powder Room

The comedy follows Sam, as her life is turned upside down on a big night out. When reunited with her old college friends, Sam is forced to re-evaluate her life and constructs an elaborate fa√ßade in order to convince herself and her friends that she has it all. But once her dysfunctional yet devoted trio of best mates intervene, her carefully crafted charade begins to crumble amidst the shots, cigarettes, ciders and toilet transgressions. Faced with some very harsh realities, Sam must struggle to remain true to herself and reassess exactly what she wants from life.
The film tells its story in a series of vignettes showing conversations held in the powder room of a nightclub. The story was partly inspired by a clubbing trip on which Hirons overheard two women talking candidly about anal sex in a cubicle of a women's toilet.[2]
