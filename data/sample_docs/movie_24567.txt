Faulad

An astrologer shares a prediction with his Maharaja (Kamal Mehra) that in 18 years his daughter will marry a lower caste man who will push him from the throne. The frightened ruler immediately orders that all newborn lower caste male children be killed. But one boy's mother places her infant son into a basket, and floats him down the river. A royal maid (Praveen Paul) finds the child and saves him and raises him within the royal court. Over the next 18 years the boy grows to become the adult Amar (Dara Singh). He soon falls in love with the Maharaja's daughter (Mumtaz) and is appointed head of the Royal Site since the Maharajah believes him to be of noble birth. The scheming Prime Minister has his own designs on the princess, and it is not long before he orchestrates Amar's falling out of favor.
