Maryada Ramanna

Faction feud in Rayalseema results in the death of Ramineedu's (V. Nagineedu) brother and he, along with his two sons Mallasuri (Supreeth Reddy) and Baireddy (Venugopal), vow for revenge. Time turns 28 years and comes to Hyderabad. Here lives Ramu (Sunil), an innocent and somewhat unlucky guy whose parents are no more and is ousted out of his job. His life takes a turn with a correspondence that he has got five acres of land in his hometown in Rayalaseema, Andhra Pradesh. He decides to sell that land and sets off to the village. In this process, he also meets Aparna (Saloni Aswani) who is the daughter of Ramineedu. However, much to Ramu's bad luck, he happens to be the son of the man who killed Ramineedu's brother and he ends up in their home itself. He takes advantage of a tradition of their house that not even one drop of blood should fall inside the house. Whether he comes alive out of their hands or not forms the rest of the story.
