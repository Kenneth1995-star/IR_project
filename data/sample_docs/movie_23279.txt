Kawashima Yoshiko

Yoshiko Kawashima is the 14th princess of Prince Su of the Qing dynasty. In order to revive Manchu culture, Prince Su sent Yoshiko to Japan to be trained as a spy by Naniwa Kawashima, who also deprived Yoshiko of her virginity. Yoshiko was ordered to marry a Mongol prince, although the marriage was a failure. After breaking with Naniwa, Yoshiko went to Shanghai and, with her beauty and leverage, she attaches herself to Japanese general Tanaka Takayoshi and helps Puyi establish Manchukuo in Hsinking. She becomes a commander of a Manchukuo army unit and a Japanese spy, seeking revenge on revolutionaries. But upon seeing her former lover Cloud, who became a revolutionary, being arrested for assassinating Takayoshi, Yoshiko has a change of mind. But a crisis will ensue.
