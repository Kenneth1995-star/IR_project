Yugandhar

Yugandhar (N.T. Rama Rao) is the most wanted criminal and killer. He is brave as well as intelligent, so the police force always fails to nab him. He kills Ramesh, who is one of his gang members, when he finds out that he is an informant of the police. His fiancee Kamini (Jayamalini) tries to avenge his death, but Yugandhar kills her. Thereafter, Ramesh's sister Jaya (Jayasudha) takes judo and karate lessons and infiltrates the mob, in order to avenge her brother's death. But before she gets a chance and unbeknownst to her, Yugandhar is fatally shot during a police encounter and later dies. The Police head is soon forced to bring Vijay who a look-alike of Yugandhar in order to arrest Yugandhar's gang members.
