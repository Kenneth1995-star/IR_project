This Boy's Life

Nomadic, flaky, Caroline Wolff, wants to settle down, find a decent man, and provide a better home for her and her son, Tobias "Toby" Wolff. When she moves to Seattle, Washington, and meets Dwight Hansen, she thinks she has accomplished her goals. However, Dwight's true personality is revealed after Toby spends a few months separated from his mother and living with Dwight and his children in a small town in the North Cascades. Dwight seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but his methods include emotional, verbal, and physical abuse.
The marriage proceeds, and Caroline recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Toby befriends a classmate, Arthur Gayle, who is a misfit at school and ambiguously gay . Hoping to leave Concrete, and live with his older brother Gregory, who has been living on the East Coast with their father, Toby decides to apply for scholarships at East Coast prep-schools. Realizing his grades are not good enough, he plans to submit falsified records. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby, saying he is behaving more and more like Dwight. Arthur helps his friend get the papers he needs to falsify his grade records, and Toby submits his prep-school applications. After numerous rejections, he is accepted by the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia, with a full scholarship.
Later, Caroline defends Toby from Dwight during a physically violent argument; they both leave Dwight and the town of Concrete.
(Note: The real Dwight died in 1992. Caroline (Rosemary Wolff) remarried and moved to Florida. Arthur Gayle left Concrete and became a successful businessman in Italy. Dwight's children all married and stayed in Seattle. Toby and his brother Geoffrey both became noted writers.)
