Dharmapuri

The movie is set in a remote village in Dharmapuri, known for making dolls from clay. It is the livelihood of people in the village. A Mokkaiyan (Manivannan) along with his sons Silandhy Karuppu (Raj Kapoor) and Peruchali Karuppu (Bobby) grab the land and give it on a lease for a local MLA Konda Mookan.
Humiliated and agitated, the villagers decide to put an end to their shenanigans. They set off in search of Sivaraman, son of Meiyappan (Vijayakumar), who once strived for the welfare of the village and later forced to flee the village due to Mokkaiyan's family.
They finally spot Sivaraman (Vijayakanth) in Rameshwaram, where he works tirelessly for the uplift of the people. They convince him to return to the village and teach Mokkaiyan and his family a lesson.
Enters Sivaraman on a mission. He comes across Valarmathy (Lakshmi Rai) and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, he also embarks on a mission to teach the baddies a lesson.
