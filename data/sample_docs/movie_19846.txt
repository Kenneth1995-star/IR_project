Sky West and Crooked

The film begins with a flashback to when an eight-years-old Brydie White [Hayley Mills] was with a playmate when he accidentally killed himself with a shotgun. Flashing forward, Brydie is a troubled seventeen-year-old girl, living in a small, isolated village in the West Country of England. It becomes apparent that, because they were alone in the churchyard, some of the adults in the village have always been suspicious of what actually happened, especially the father of her playmate whose shotgun killed his son. Their negative feelings and behaviour towards Brydie are compounded by their disapproval of the fact that her mother was not married to her late father. Her mother is a sad and lonely person who is not a good mother to Brydie, and she drinks heavily. A band of gypsies have recently taken up residence near the village, which some of the villagers are not at all pleased about, so, when one of the young gypsies, Roibin Krisenki [Ian McShane], takes a romantic interest in Brydie, emotions begin to run high in both communities.
