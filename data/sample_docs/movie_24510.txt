Kohinoor

After the passing of Maharaj Dhiraj Rana Chandrabhan of Kailash Nagar, the Senapati, Veer Singh, crowns Rajkumar Dhivendra Pratap Bahadur Chandrabhan as the next King. Veer's wife, who has brought up Dhivendra like her own son, Surinder, would like Dhivendra to get married to Rajkumari Chandramukhi of Rajgarh. The Maharaja of Rajgarh is pleased to hear of this, and asks his daughter to set forth to Kailash Nagar. On the way there, she is abducted by her very own Senapati and held captive until she gives her consent to marry him. Dhivendra rescues her, both fall in love, but are captured by Senapati's men. Dhivendra is gravely injured, but manages to escape and is looked after by Rajgarh's Raj Nartaki, Rajlaxmi, who also falls in love with him. After Dhivendra recuperates, he finds out that Chandramukhi is being held against her will at Senapati's castle, he sets forth to set her free, but is captured in the process. Held in chains, he is blinded by a vengeful Rajlaxmi, and Chandramukhi is given an ultimatum - either wed Senapati or witness the death of Dhivendra.
