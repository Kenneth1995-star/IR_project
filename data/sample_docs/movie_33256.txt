The Way to Fight

In Osaka in the 1970s, a teenage street-fighter named Kazuyoshi Tamai (Kyosuke Yabe) builds a reputation as the toughest guy in town. His troubles start when he discovers that he and his best friend Toshio are in love with the same girl, Ritsuko. Then he crosses paths with Takeshi Hamada (Kazuki Kitamura) a student at a rival high school and an excellent fighter in his own right, who is the leader of the gang of assaulters. Kazuyoshi is determined to challenge Takeshi one on one, but because of a series of unforeseen circumstances, his ambition for a final battle is constantly and comically thwarted. Years later they have each achieved a certain level of success - Tamai as a boxer champion and Takeshi as a popular professional wrestler. The two finally get around to settling their old dispute in the Tokyo Dome.
