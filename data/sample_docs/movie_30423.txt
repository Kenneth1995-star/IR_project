Krishna Krishna

Gopalakrishnan (S. Ve. Shekher), a perfect gentleman, wants to get married as soon as possible. His mother 'Bullet' Pushpa (Manorama) only wants an extremely wealthy daughter-in-law so she rejects every marriage proposal. While Bama (Sukanya) hates the kind of rich grooms her father (Venniradai Moorthy) brings for her. One day, Bama sees Gopalakrishnan at the bus stop and she falls in love at first sight with him. Finally, they fall in love with each other and get married in a police station without their parents' permission. After the marriage, 'Bullet' Pushpa and Bama often quarrel for small matters. Bama hates lies, if the same person lied to her four times, she will not bear the person. Soon, Bama suspects the innocent Gopalakrishnan for having bad habits. She decides to divorce him. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
