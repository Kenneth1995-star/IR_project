Gurudev

Inspector Dev Kumar and Gaurav (alias Guru) are childhood friends. While Dev Kumar is with the police, his dad, Parshu Ram, works with the underworld and is the right-hand man of Kakhan, a criminal don who is Guru's dad.
When Inspector Khan is assigned the case of apprehending Kakhan, his first suspect is Dev himself. Dev must prove to Khan that he is earnest and will not hesitate to arrest Kakhan. It remains to be seen if Dev will apprehend his friend's dad or just play around.
