Kadhalukku Mariyadhai

Jeevanantham "Jeeva" (Vijay) is a very rich young man. Although his parents (Chandrasekhar (Sivakumar) and Srividya) want him to settle down, he goes to another city to do his MBA and stays with friends. During this time, he meets Mini (Shalini) and they fall in love. She reciprocates his feelings, but trouble comes in the form of her tyrannical trio of brothers (James (Radha Ravi), Thomas (Thalaivasal Vijay) and Stephen (Shaji Khan)), who are overprotective of their little sister and take an irrational dislike to Jeeva. They show hostility towards Jeeva and conflicts arise within the households and when the couple decide to elope, they go to Kesavan’s (Charle) hometown and his father (Manivannan) refuges them before the proposed wedding. Jeeva tries to convince his mother one last time and in vain. On the day of the wedding both realise they miss their families. They decide to return home, relinquishing their feelings, and the families are happy and take them back. Jeeva’s mom wants to see Mini so that she can get a better wife for her son and goes to meet Mini. Initially reluctant to welcome them, the brothers hesitate, but their mother welcomes them, ultimately their families accept their love, and they are reunited.
