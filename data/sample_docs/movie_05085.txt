Covered Wagon Raid

A prospective settler, pioneer Bob Davis, is gunned down by hired guns Grif and Brag, who work for saloonkeeper and prospective land baron Harvey "Deacon" Grimes. The killing is witnessed by insurance investigator Rocky Lane, who decides to go undercover and help the dead man's daughter, Susie.
Rancher's daughter Gail Warren gets acquainted with Rocky, but inadvertently reveals his true identity to Grimes and his men. Rocky is able to prevail, however, and leaves town, promising to come back.
