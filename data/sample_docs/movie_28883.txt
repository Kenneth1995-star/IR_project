Sargi

Sargi is a romantic love triangle involving Rubina Bajwa, Jassi Gill and Babbal Rai. The story starts in Punjab where Jassi Gill is shown to be in love with Rubina since childhood but never had the courage to express his feelings. In order to provide a better living for her family, Rubina decides to do a sham marriage with Karamjit Anmol for immigration purposes and moves abroad with him. Unaware, Jassi was left heart broken. Rubina joins a restaurant run by B N Sharma, whose son Babbal Rai, falls in love with Rubina. When Jassi gets to know about Rubina's sham marriage, he also moves abroad and joins the same restaurant in quest to get his love. Now begins the game of one-upmanship among Jassi, Babbal and Karamjit. Jassi or Babbal, whom does Rubina choose forms the rest of the story. The first half sets up the traditional form of romance with Jassi head over heels in love with Rubina but failing to express his feelings. This half is little slow but has a nice charm. After the Interval, there is a sense of deja-vu with Babbal Rai trying to woo Rubina and then the game of one-upmanship amongst the suitors of Rubina.[3]
