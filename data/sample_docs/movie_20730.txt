Simon Magus

A Jew named Dovid Bendel (Stuart Townsend) tries to revive his dwindling village by building a railway station next to it. The squire (Rutger Hauer) agrees to provide the land, on the condition that Dovid will read his poetry. A cunning business man (Sean McGinley) is also interested in the land and he tries to compete using money and threats.
