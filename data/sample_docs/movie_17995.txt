Buk Fatey To Mukh Foteyna

Rimaan (Shakib Khan) is the son of a multimillionaire in Dhaka. He has a love interest in Rumana, who has a friend Apu. Apu’s father Shohel Rana wants to get her married to her cousin Misha Shadogor, who is a rowdy, which Apu doesn’t like. Naturally, her paternal-grandfather bluffs to the family that she has already fallen in love with a guy in the city. Rumana helps her by renting Rimaan as her would-be, just to let her escape the wedding situation for the time being.
