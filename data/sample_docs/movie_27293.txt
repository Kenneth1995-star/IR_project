Preethi Prema Pranaya

Family of Dr. Chandrashekhar (Ananthnag) - a widower in his family has a son Dr. Ashok (Prakash Rai) and daughter-in-law Jyothi (Sudharani) and grandson Vivek (Sunil Rao). Second son Ajay (Arun Sagar) too is a doctor with wife Sheela (Bhavana), an ad professional. Well settled doctor has enough name and fame but the concern doted by his sons irritates him. Their over cautious behavior suffocates him. Too much is too bad. He happens to meet Sharadha Devi (Bharathi), a widow, in an accident and as a doctor he does his duty but with an 'extra care'. This leads into friendship and later they could not resist meeting each other with some pretext or the other. He finds the kind of affection, love and care that he needed at his age through this relationship with Sharadha Devi and vis-Ã -vis. Film takes an enlivening climax when Chandrashekar takes a bold step to face his family member and the society. This demonstrates that every human being needs someone 'who cares for them', 'who listens to them', 'who shares their feelings' no matter what age group you are in.
