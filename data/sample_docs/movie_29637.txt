A mild-mannered and timid man causes amusement when he comes to work in a business â€” because of his resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Soon, however, he finds himself growing into a more forceful and dynamic person, becoming a charismatic leader and a successful businessman as his wife teaches him more and more about Hitler's charismatic personality and leadership abilities. In the end, once he finds out about Hitler's evil deeds, he regrets emulating such a evil person.
