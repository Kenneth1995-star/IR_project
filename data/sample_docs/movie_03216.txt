Tom, Dick and Harry

Janie (Ginger Rogers) is a telephone operator and a daydreamer. Her fondest wish is to land a rich husband. She has a boyfriend, Tom (George Murphy), a car salesman, who wants to get married, which results in Janie dreaming about what their life together would be like.
Listening in on a long-distance phone call between the wealthiest eligible bachelor in town, Dick Hamilton (Alan Marshal), and the girl Dick has been dating, Janie makes a wish that she could meet him. When an expensive car pulls alongside her that instant, Janie takes it as her wish being granted. Turns out it is garage mechanic Harry (Burgess Meredith), driving it to be repaired.
Harry is immediately smitten. He spends time with Janie, kisses her and proposes marriage. Janie's head is spinning and she daydreams about being a mechanic's wife.
Disconnecting a call, Janie causes a quarrel between Dick and his girl. She ends up meeting Dick and falling for him. Tom and Harry are waiting for her, leading Janie to declare that she's engaged to all three. A dream of being Dick's wealthy wife causes her to choose him, but at the last minute, a kiss from Harry changes her mind one last time.
