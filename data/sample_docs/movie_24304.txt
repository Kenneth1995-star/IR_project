Dard

Nawab Sahib (Badri Prasad) lives with his wife, the Begum (Pratima Devi) and their young daughter Suraiya (Munawwar Sultana). While attending a function at an orphanage, he becomes impressed by a student, Iqbal (Nusrat) and brings him home. After some initial friction Suraiya and the boy become friends. Iqbal grows up to become a doctor while Suraiya falls in love with him. She gifts him a big diamond ring. A friend (Husn Banu) of Suraiya's takes great pleasure in teasing the two, which Suraiya doesn't mind but is frowned upon by Iqbal.
Iqbal decides to serve at a village where there is an outbreak of plague. Here he meets Hamida (Suraiya) and the two fall in love in-between his ministrations to the sick. One of the villagers, Dilawar (Shyam Kumar), is a suitor of Hamida and jealous of the love interest between Hamida and Iqbal. Dilawar blackmails Iqbal about their romance, threatening to inform Nawab Sahib unless Iqbal gives him Rs. 10, 000. A scared Iqbal gives Dilawar the diamond ring gifted to him by Suraiya. Iqbal falls ill and the Nawab arrives with an ambulance to take him home. Hamida's father is killed by Dilawar, who then proceeds to lie to Hamida, telling her that Iqbal had left the ring for her and gives it to her. Hamida accepts it and wears it on her finger.
Hamida is taken in by the Nawab who brings her back to his house. Misunderstandings arise between Iqbal and Hamida when he sees the ring. The two however get back together again with their differences resolved.. Suraiya in the meanwhile shows symptoms of consumption, with coughing and fever. A marriage is arranged between her and Iqbal. Suraiya finds out about their love and she sacrifices her love for the two and dies.
