The film is set in Bhatinda, with its thermal power plants and factories always in the background and is based on the true story of this city and its people.[3]
The daughter of an ex Army man (Naseeruddin Shah) discovers that she has a serious life threatening illness. Gradually they piece together the reason for this and discover that it is due to the carcinogenic elements that have entered the ground water. Everyone in the city is affected by it.[4]
A journalist meanwhile has discovered files that will incriminate the people responsible for this ground water poisoning, but he is kidnapped and missing. His girl friend (Sagarika Ghatge), who is also a journalist pursues the case, trying to convince the authorities to arrest the people responsible.
Meanwhile, a mysterious bomb blast in a business tycoon (Sharad Kelkar)'s factory prompts the state CM (Divya Dutta) to hire an NIA officer (Arshad Warsi). He meets the ex-army man seeking revenge for his dead daughter and the journalist demanding justice for her slain boyfriend. He himself tries to balance his knowledge of the truth, his wish for a more stable posting (having just come from a Naxal region), a better family life and his conscience. Nothing is what it seems.
The film raises the contemporary ecological issues of uranium poisoning, reverse boring, fertliser poisoning due to the green revolution and their immediate adverse impact on the people who live in Malwa region, with a lot of thrills en route.[5]
