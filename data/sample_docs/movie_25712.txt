Pehchaan

Judge Jagdish Verma (Raza Murad) has an accused by the name of Yogi Shankar (Kiran Kumar) in his courtroom. Judge Verma was once Yogi's defence lawyer, but now must pass a sentence against him. Yogi pleads his innocence, but the Judge finds him guilty, and Yogi is sentenced to a long term (7 years) in jail. Yogi swears to avenge this injustice and humiliation. Judge Verma's family consists of Urmila, a prostitute (Beena Banerjee), two sons, Kunal and Karan (Sunil Shetty and Saif Ali Khan respectively), and a daughter Tina (Madhoo). Yogi serves out his term and is released from jail, seeking revenge against Juge Verma and his family. He abducts young Tina and plans to use her to control the judge and his judgments. The family is instructed not to contact the police, for the safety of Tina, and to keep this abduction a secret. Tina grows up in the company of Yogi and his men, without knowing her biological family. Tina is then used to ensnare the family into more deceit and entrapment under the direction of Yogi, leaving the Verma family no choice but to go along with Yogi's plan.
