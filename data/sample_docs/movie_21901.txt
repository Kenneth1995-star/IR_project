Clearcut

Arthur (Greene) rises up into the world from beneath the water, in a rural, forested area in Canada. A seaplane arrives, carrying a passenger to a First Nations reserve, where activists are engaged in a loud, chaotic conflict, attempting to block clearcutting on Indian land. The white man from the seaplane is a lawyer, Peter Maguire (Lea), who is representing the band whose land is designated for deforestation. Peter attempts to appeal the court decision which ruled in favor of the logging company, but to no avail.
An elder member of the Nation, Wilf (Westerman) introduces the attorney to Arthur, who the attorney believes is a militant Indigenous activist. Arthur proceeds to kidnap the logging company's general manager, Bud (Hogan) and the four take off through the woods where Arthur claims he will "instruct" Peter and Bud in "listening to Mother Earth".
As they travel deeper into the wilderness, Arthur says he will show them the damage caused to the land. Arthur's behaviour grows increasingly erratic and violent. Wilf's warnings and insinuations that Arthur may actually be Wisakedjak, an Indigenous trickster spirit (whom Wilf also refers to as "the Deceiver") begin to make more sense. Peter is faced with difficult decisions that test his loyalties and sense of reality. At the end Arthur, or whatever he is, returns into the water once again.
