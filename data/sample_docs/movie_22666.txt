Finding Mr. Right

Wen Jiajia is pregnant with the child of her boyfriend, a corrupt businessman in Beijing who is already married and is under criminal investigation. She flies to Seattle so she can have her child in an illegal maternity center as a way of avoiding scandal and obtaining American citizenship for the child. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport she is picked up by Frank, a taxi driver who was a doctor in China before coming to the United States. Frank came to Seattle because his ex-wife took a job in the city's pharmaceutical industry; Frank moved to be closer to their daughter, Julie. Jiajia recognizes Frank because he once treated her father. Frank and Jiajia do not get along at first, but slowly begin to see the good in each other.
In the film, Jiajia's sugar daddy does not leave his wife, leaving Jiajia on her own. Jiajia eventually begins a romance with Frank. However, she leaves Frank to be re-united with her boyfriend in China after the latter left his wife. The relationship doesn't work because Jiajia sees the emptiness of material comfort without real love. She runs into Frank 2 years later atop the Empire State building a la Sleepless in Seattle and they begin a relationship.
