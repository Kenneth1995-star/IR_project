Three friends, Fred (Stretch), Tyg (Bell) and Grouch (Daniels), set out on a motorcycle trip to Wales in order to bring back a haul of cannabis for Fred's friend The Chairman (Bowles). What was meant to be a nice weekend in the country soon turns into an ordeal.
Along the way, they encounter revenge seeking bikers and a giant masked wrestler in the pub. Or maybe it's just those magic mushrooms they had for breakfast.
