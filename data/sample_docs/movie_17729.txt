Take Away

Tony Stilano and Trev Spackneys both own, live over and work in adjoining take-away fish and chip shops in Melbourne. Although they have fallen into a habitual rivalry based on a cause long forgotten, the pair unite when the multinational fast-food outlet "Burgies" unveils a new store directly opposite the twin fish and chips shops.
Stilano (portrayed by Vince Colosimo) is an uptight store runner, demanding everything be in order including his drinks- the coldest must always be at the front. Spackneys (played by Stephen Curry), however is the opposite. His chips are made of dirty potatoes and he couldn't care less about health or safety precautions. Both owners are aided by their two romantically linked apprentices. Sonja Stilano (Tony's cousin, played by Rose Byrne) and Dave (played by Nathan Phillips).
