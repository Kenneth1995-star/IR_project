Baaghi

Raja (Sanjay Dutt) is in love with a night club dancer, Rani (Manisha Koirala). Rani gets Raja a job as a security guard in a Hotel run by Vikram (Aditya Pancholi). Raju's life turns haywire when Manubhai (Gulshan Grover) falls for Rani and tries to get her at any cost. Rani istead of falling prey to his lusty charms prefers to kill herself. Raja then turns into a professional killer in Vikram's gang. Raja comes across Soorya (master Rohan) who idolizes him as his hero and even adopts his lifestyle. Soorya (Inder Kumar) grows up and falls in love with Vikram's sister Kiran (Tina Sen). Initially Raja encourages Soorya, but when he comes to know that the girl is Kiran, he advises Soorya to relent, but in vain. Raja also tries to pacify Vikram, but in vain. Raja becomes a rebel with a cause, mainly to protect love.( Written by Sahibzada Imaduddin)
