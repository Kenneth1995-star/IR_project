Fall

The film follows the mundane life of Father Sam, who tends to his small Niagara Falls parish. His life is weary and he appears to simply be going through the motions of his life routine. Among his parishioners are a young couple wanting to get married outside their own parish and a gay Iranian man who is struggling with his feeling about his recently deceased mother.
Father Sam’s life changes when he receives a letter, which forces his complacent life into descent. The letter is from Christopher, now on his death bed, who Father Sam had mentored 40 years ago. The letter alleges to an incident where Father Sam shares a bed with Christopher when he was 14 years old and he asks whether or not anything inappropriate had occurred.
This leads Father Sam to embark on a roadtrip to Northern Ontario where he visits his mother and sister and then to confront Christopher’s widow Catherine. She bitterly accuses him of having sexually molested her late husband, which Father Sam denies, but it is apparent that not even he is exactly sure about what happened 40 years ago during that night.
The film features lots of lengthy scenic scenes of the natural backdrops of the roaring waterfalls with minimal dialogue in most scenes. The film displays “Murphy’s ability to command the screen with stillness”[5]
