Bloodbrothers

Set in a working-class Bronx community, it tells the story of the De Coco family, a family of construction workers. Thomas is the head of the family with three sons, but one, Stony (Richard Gere) wants to be a teacher, not a hardhat. Then he accepts a job as a recreational assistant at a children's ward. Immediately, bitter divisions begin to surface.
