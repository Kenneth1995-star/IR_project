Dragon in Jail

Wayne Cheung (Kenny Ho) is a rich heir who impulsively committed a crime because he was unable to accept the fact that his mother remarried. After being sentenced to prison, he is bullied by his inmates but is helped by his roommate Henry (Andy Lau), whom he befriends. After release, Wayne goes to study law in Britain while Henry joins the triads due to his family environment. Two years later, Cheung returns and becomes a lawyer while Henry also becomes a gang leader. Due to his conflict with another triad leader Charlie Ma (William Ho), Henry's pregnant wife Winnie (Gigi Lai) is raped and killed. Henry later takes revenge on Ma, and although successful, he is imprisoned again and Wayne becomes his defensive lawyer. With the help of Wayne and his friend Skinny (John Ching), will Henry be released from prison?
