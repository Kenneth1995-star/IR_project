City Across the River

Two members of a tough Brooklyn street gang accidentally kill one of their teachers.
Frank Cusack is a leading member of the Amboy Dukes teenage gang based in a slum-ridden area of Brooklyn. His activities with the gang ultimately lead from vandalism and hooliganism to complicity in the murder of a school teacher. His hopes—and those of his parents—for an escape from the bleakness of slum life are dashed by his willingness to accept the gang code of not informing to the police.
