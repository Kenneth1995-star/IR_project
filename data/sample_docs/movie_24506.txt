Ek Phool Char Kaante

The film is a light-hearted comic love story, wherein Sunil Dutt falls in love with a "phool" (flower) Waheeda Rehman, but has to impress her four uncles, the "kante" (thorns) of the title. Each uncle has a different idiosyncrasy and Sunil Dutt pretends to be an expert in that field in order to impress that particular uncle. The four uncles select their protégé for their niece, not knowing that each is selecting the same boy. When the boy whom they have approved disappears, they agree to marry their niece off to her choice, who is Sunil Dutt again.
