Table No. 21

Vivaan (Rajeev Khandelwal) and Siya Agasthi (Tina Desai) struggle to make ends meet. The couple win a trip to the beautiful island nation of Fiji in a lucky draw. The holiday is fully sponsored, with luxurious hotel accommodation and fine dinners. The duo fly to Fiji to celebrate their wedding anniversary and encounter the charming Mr. Khan (Paresh Rawal) at the resort. Mr Khan invites the couple to participate in a live game show called Table No 21. He tells them that the winner of the game bags a staggering amount of ₹210 million as prize money. He outlines the rules which are eight personal questions asked that must be answered truthfully, and following this, one must complete a task related to the question. The couple decides to enter the game show. At first, the questions seem easy, but as the game progresses, the tasks become increasingly horrific connected to their college life. Vivaan's final task is to murder an individual. He is led to a room, where he is to face his target. When he sees the person he must kill, he recognises him from his past. A flashback shows Vivaan and his friends ragging a boy, named Akram (Dhruv Ganesh). The severe bullying made Akram mentally challenged. Back in the present, it is revealed that Akram is Mr. Khan's son, and that Mr. Khan's intention was to exact revenge and show Vivaan and Siya the damage inflicted on Akram by their actions. Mr. Khan tells them that they are free to go but their sins will follow them everywhere. The movie ends as Vivaan and Siya are still shocked – crying and regretting their choices. The end credits show upsetting cases of ragging.
