Woman in a Dressing Gown

The Prestons are an apparently happy household, made up of wife Amy (Yvonne Mitchell), husband Jim (Anthony Quayle) and teenage son Brian (Andrew Ray), living in a cramped flat on a London housing estate. Although the family appears happy, tensions soon become clear. Though she is a hardworking, breezy, loving character, Amy has always been a disorganised housewife, and finds it difficult to concentrate enough to tidy or cook properly. Jim is having an affair with a co-worker, Georgie (Sylvia Syms), who threatens to break it off unless Jim divorces his wife and leaves his family. He promises that he will do so, and eventually demands a divorce from Amy. Amy is shocked and distraught, while Brian becomes angry with his father.
Amy phones to invite Jim and Georgie back to the Prestons' flat, to try to convince Georgie not to take her husband away. In preparation, she gets her hair done, buys a bottle of spirits for her husband and tries to organise a meal, paying for it all by pawning her engagement ring. However, on leaving the hairdresser's she is caught in the rain, ruining the hairdo. At home, after discussing the matter with a neighbour, a young unhappy wife, who persuades Amy to have a glass from the spirits bottle to calm her down, Amy becomes drunk and falls asleep on the bed, again ruining her plans. After a confrontation she orders Jim and Georgie out of the flat. Jim leaves, but has second thoughts, returning to his wife and son, who cautiously accept him back.
