Cairo Road

A team of Egyptian anti-narcotic agents led by Colonel Youssef Bey (Eric Portman), the chief of the Anti-Narcotic Bureau, and his new assistant Lieutenant Mourad (Laurence Harvey), recently relocated from Paris with his wife Marie (Maria Mauban), try to prevent shipments of drugs crossing the southern Egyptian border. They are constantly on alert as even camel caravans are suspect in smuggling narcotics.
The agents are investigating the murder of a rich Arab businessman named Bashiri. Raiding a berthed ship in the harbor of Port Saïd, leads them to the trail of heroin smugglers, including Rico Pavlis (Harold Lang) and Lombardi (Grégoire Aslan). One of the police agents, Anna Michelis (Camelia) is targeted by the smugglers.
Eventually, Pavlis turns on his partner, killing Lombardi but Youssef sets a trap for the Pavlis brothers, and the capture of the two remaining criminal gang leaders and their men, proves the police are competent at stemming the flow of narcotics.
