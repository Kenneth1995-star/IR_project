Lal Patthar

Raja Kumar Bahadur, known as Gyan Shankar Rai (Raaj Kumar), is an abstemious man who turns to drink after pursuing a young woman named Saudamani (Hema Malini). Calling her Madhuri, he attracts the lower class woman to his rich home but refuses to marry her. He later meets a much younger woman, Sumita (Raakhee), and organises a financial deal with her parents and marries her. The discovery that Sumita had a childhood sweetheart, Shekhar (Vinod Mehra), leads Kumar to plot the downfall of the pair.
