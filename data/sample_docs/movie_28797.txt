Baghtos Kay Mujra Kar

Settled at the foothills of a fort is a quaint village 'Kharbujewaadi'. This village is a land of many a 'Mavla' who served Shivaji Maharaj with great valour. The courage, grit and sacrifice that this village had to offer, played a major role in King Shivaji's fight for 'Hindavi Swarajya'.
But... those were the days. Today, Kharbujewadi is a much developed modern town. Their eternal loyalty to the great Maratha king Shivaji, forever on exhibit, the village is strewn with shops named: Shivaji Vada Pav Centre, Jijamata Saree Corner, Sambhaji Pan Shop, Tanaji Medicals etc. Unfortunately, their love for their beloved king is limited to the signboards, slogans on the cars and saffron coloured tilak on the foreheads.
The most important symbol of the Hindavi Swarajya, the forts of Shivaji Maharaj are long forgotten. The once majestic fort overlooking this buzzing town lays in ruins, tainted with tobacco laden spit, garbage, empty beer bottles and lovers declaring their love for each other on the same walls where the brave mawlas spilt their blood for Swarajya.
But there is a ray of hope... Suryabhan Tanaji Deshmukh aka Nanasaheb is the current Sarpanch of Kharbujewaadi, with two cronies Pandurang Tukaram aka Panda and Shivram Abaji Vahadne aka Shiva. Nana, an ardent follower of Shivaji Maharaj wants to restore the decaying fort for the people to remember their legacy in all its glory. He has designed a plan.
What is this outrageous plan? Is it going to work? Will their dream to restore this fort become a reality?
