Inspector Pink Dragon

Inspector Ma Yue-lung (Lawrence Cheng) bumps into his ex-classmate and longtime lover, Julia (Rosamund Kwan), while catching a thief. They both later go to an alumni reunion and see another ex-classmate, Ma Yau-yau (Tony Leung Ka-fai), who is now Julia's superior. When Yau returns home, he is murdered by Peter (Peter Lai). Heavy Crime Bureau chief Pau Yu Chat (Kenneth Tsang) sends Lung to go undercover to take Yau's job. After Lung goes undercover, he rises in rank and his paychecks increase. Julia also begins to develop feelings for Lung. Lung's girlfriend, Ching (Nina Li Chi), suspects that something is wrong with Lung. Later, Julia brings Lung to meet a land developer, Tang Kwok-kiu (Damian Lau). During that time, another murder case comes up. Lung later finds out that Tang is the mastermind behind this, but he, Julia and Ching has become Tang's chests. Another inspector, Shek Chun (Waise Lee), then gathers evidence and is determined to bring Tang to justice.
