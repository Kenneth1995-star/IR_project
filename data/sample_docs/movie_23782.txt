An old man Lando (Ronnie Lazaro) has buried something under his house. When he is finished, he encounters a group of white people. The chieftain (Manu Respall) demands Lando to return something that belongs to them which he refuses. Angered, he and his tribesmen savagely kill him.
Bikbok (Bugoy Cari√±o) moves to an isolated town with his blind mother Isay (Maricar Reyes), his baby brother and his discontented stepfather Allan (Zanjoe Marudo) to survive poverty where Allan can take charge at the farm after his uncle Lando died earlier. The next day, Allan finds something under the house where he encounters an object that was buried by Lando earlier which reveals to be a crystalline egg. At night, Bikbok watches outside and notices the white creatures watching him.
The next day, Allan's cousin Pey (Ervic Vijandre) takes Isay, Allan and Bikbok to Aling Epang (Celia Rodriguez) to cure their baby. After they leave when Bikbok began to collect some water, he saw a group of sparks and decides to follow it. He stops by where he finds a waterfall and began venturing it. When he plays at the waterfall, he notices the same creatures earlier are watching him. The chieftain orders his tribe to catch him as Bikbok runs. He attempts to escape but the creatures corner him. The chieftain tells him to give back something which it was stolen but Bikbok assures that he and his family didn't steal anything. The chieftain tells him that if he didn't return it otherwise on the third day at night when the new moon arrives, he and his family will be in danger. Bikbok runs to Aling Epang for help and tells her what he saw. Epang realizes the white creatures were the Tamawos, a group of fairy people who were creatures and tribal warriors who always take away people even children. After Bikbok tells her on what they have stolen, Epang tells him that he needs to find out what they have stolen because the tamawos will never stop until it was returned. Meanwhile, Pey was killed by the tamawos when he encountered them at the forest. At night, Bikbok and his family were attacked by the tamawos and Allan was wounded from their attack.
After Epang had his foot healed, Bikbok tries to tell him his story but Allan distrusts him. Allan walks to the forest and tried to find Pey, where he finds his mutilated body. Horrified and grieved, they decide to leave. When Bikbok enters Allan's room, he finds the crystalline egg with a baby inside, realizing it is the object that the tamawos were looking for. The next day, Allan decides to take revenge on the people who killed Pey where the ranch owner (Rez Cortez) began blaming him on the incident. Out of anger, Allan begrudgingly leaves. He returns to the house driven insane and decides to leave when he finds the egg gone. Outraged, he demands them of the egg. When Isay tells Bikbok that he stole it, Allan threatens Bikbok but Isay hits him to protect her son. When Allan threatens Isay, she urges Bikbok to escape. He grabs the egg and runs off but Allan chases after him. Meanwhile, the tamawos capture Isay and the baby. Bikbok tries to return the egg, but Allan finds him and attempts to grab the egg. After some struggling, Allan throws the egg, breaking it where the tamawos notice this. After Allan runs off, the tamawos arrive and see their baby had died which enrages them. Meanwhile, at the cave, Isay finds her baby when the tamawos began to take them. Allan arrives at the cave and fights the tamawos to save her. They begin to escape but the tamawos arrive and corner them. They begin attacking Allan as he begs for mercy but the chieftain refuses for committing everything he had done, telling him that humans are greedy, as the tribe kills him.
As the tamawos start to take Isay, Bikbok runs to the tamawos and begs them to take him instead for their baby. The tamawos gently accept his request. Bikbok bids farewell to his mother, and Isay begins to cry in anguish before Epang arrives and they helplessly watch him get taken away by the tamawos.

After Cynthia and her husband Mar (Jay Manalo)'s anniversary plans were ruined, she began to have labor and Mar takes her to the hospital. The next day, the news featured Marikina where youth workers died at the factory after the typhoon stopped.
The next year, Cynthia and Mar moved to a condominium and they were expecting another baby after their baby died from miscarriage earlier. After working at their new plastic factory, Mar's brother Nante (Edgar Allan Guzman) began to bring Cynthia back to the condominium to cook dinner. It rained before they left and Cynthia became aquaphobic because of the typhoon. At the parking lot, Cynthia left Nante and returned to the condominium.

While there, the man finds the warehouse locked, however, Cynthia decided to show them more around the place. Later, after Cynthia collecting her allowance, she encounters an old woman (Perla Bautista) who returned the donation and gave her warning but then a guard forced her to leave. Cynthia was horrified and she collapsed. After she recovered at the hospital, she noticed children drawing an eye while singing and then returned to the condominium. Cynthia had another nightmare and it involved Mar. She woke up and Mar was nearly drowned while sleeping. After Mar arrived at the apartment, Cynthia began to tell him about her nightmare and the tragedy from the typhoon earlier which Mar disbelieved. That night, Cynthia, Mar, and his mother Maritess (Boots Anson-Roa) and their maid Dina (Tess Antonio) arrived at the factory with a priest to bless it. After the priest left, the old woman, whom Cynthia encountered earlier, was there watching her.
After Cynthia had a baby, she noticed the old lady talking to Dina. Before leaving, Cynthia began to question Dina about what the old lady said.

At the hospital, after her baby's birth, both Cynthia and Maritess became guilty about the youth workers who died during the typhoon earlier. It was revealed that Cynthia & her family were responsible for that tragedy. They locked the youth workers in the warehouse at the factory after their shift. Before the arrival of the typhoon and the family began to leave, they beg the family for help until they were killed from the typhoon. Their spirits began to haunt them by killing each of the family members through water. As Maritess began to leave the hospital, she noticed the children still standing in the middle of the road. She was killed when a truck of mineral water hit her. After selling their new factory, Cynthia began to give the donation back to the old woman but the lady refused because her grandchildren have been working to help her grandmother.
