Sendhoora Devi

Sindhu and Nandu (both played by Shamili) are twin sisters but they were raised separately with no knowledge of each other. Their parents got divorced a few years back. Sindhu lives with her mother Selvi (Kanaka) and grandfather Somasundaram (Venniradai Moorthy) while Nandu lives with her father Gopal (Vivek). Gopal is a popular veterinarian and has four animals in his houseÂ : the elephant Chellappa, the dog Bhairavan, the monkey Ramu and the horse Madurai Veeran. Nandu spends lot of time with her animals, she considers them like her friends.
One day, the criminal Jagannath (Kitty) ask Gopal to put two tubes (containing top secret informations) in his horses' belly. Jagannath has to send the horses to Hong Kong as soon as possible. Gopal refuses to perform surgery on horses in good health and he doesn't want to break the law. Jagannath has no other choice than to kidnap Gopal's daughter. Jagannath's henchmen kidnaps both of his daughters and they lock them up in a room. Sindhu and Nandu realize that they are sisters, and flee away from the place thanks to Nandu's animals. The girls hide the tubes behind a huge Mariamman statue. The girls want to unite their parents, so the twins swap their places to convince their parents. In the meantime, Jagannath is urged to recover the tubes. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
