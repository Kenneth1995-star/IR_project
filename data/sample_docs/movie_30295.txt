Thalaimurai

Pandithurai (Raj Kiran) and Naachchiyaa (Revathi) are a respectable couple in the village. Naachchiyaa manages to conceive after 7 seven long years of marriage. She has a still born baby - Pandithurai replaces the dead baby with an illegitimate baby born to Panchavarnam (Bhanupriya) in the same hospital the same day, out of love for his wife, since he thinks that she would die if she hears that her baby was born dead. Raj Kapoor is the villain who is the father of this baby; Panchavarnam and Pandithurai promise each other that they wouldn't reveal this secret to anybody; but their conversation is overheard by Radha Ravi (Naachchiyaa's loving elder brother) and starts hating Muthu since he thinks he is an illegitimate child born to Panchavarnam and Pandithurai, but manages to keep it to himself out of fear of breaking up his sister's family. Panchavarnam joins the thurai household as domestic help. The son Muthu grows up to be an irresponsible but a very tender man (Adhiyaman), he is greatly hated by his uncle and the entire village. Radha Ravi's daughter (played by newcomer Lakshmi) and Muthu are in love and are supported by the entire family except Radha Ravi, who knows the secret of Muthu's parentage. He blurts the truth out to his sister in anger when she asks the reason for his opposition to their children's marital union. How the various characters involved (Pandithurai, Naachchiyaa, Muthu and Panchavarnam) come to terms with this new revelation, forms the rest of the story.
