Naruto Shippūden 4: The Lost Tower

Assigning on a mission to capture a missing-nin named Mukade, Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Yamato and Sai wield chakra-knives. At the one thousand year old city ruins of Rouran, they confront Mukade, a time traveller attempting to dominate the Ninja World with the power of the Ryūmyaku (the Ley Line in English), an ancient chakra flowing deep underground. He breaks Minato Namikaze's seal to unleash the power, causing the light to engulf Naruto and Yamato, before Sai and Sakura ride on an ink bird and attempt to escape.
Naruto and Yamato are sent twenty years into the past. When Naruto awakens from this time slip, he meets the queen of Rouran Sāra. It is later revealed that Mukade traveled to the past six years and changed his name to Anrokuzan, the minister of Loran who killed Sāra's mother Sēramu. Naruto agrees to protect Sāra, after Anrokuzan declares about the kidnapped citizens and creates to summon the "Puppet Ninja Forces". Minato, Shibi Aburame, Chōza Akimichi and Kakashi Hatake appear to support the heroes. While they rescue Sara's people and Naruto holds Minato's kunai, Sāra recalls her memory about Sēramu's lullaby. Anrokuzan uses the parts of the tower to become a giant defensive puppet. Minato and Naruto use their regenerative chakra enough to create the legendary Super Rasengan. After Sāra disables Anrokuzan's technique, Minato exposes Anrokuzan's weak spot and Naruto destroys it. As Yamato and Kakashi rescue Naruto and Sāra, Minato uses the kunai to completely seal off the power. Just as the heroes vanish from the past, Minato asks Naruto not to change history by erasing all of their memories.
With Mukade gone, Sakura and Sai reunite with Naruto and Yamato. They run into Queen Sāra, who kept the old chakra blade. She informs that it was given to her mother by a 'hero in a dream', and that she remains in the city.
