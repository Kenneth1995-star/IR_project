52 Tuesdays

In suburban Australia, 16-year-old Billie lives with her lesbian mother Jane, who is divorced from her father Tom, and with Jane's younger brother (Billie's uncle) Harry. One day Jane reveals plans to undergo a gender transition, now calling himself James. More importantly for Billie, James wants Billie to live with Tom for a year, with which Tom has agreed, restricting the time Billy is together with Jane/James to Tuesdays from 16:00 - 22:00, starting on the 23rd of August. The film is divided into the corresponding 52 segments, each covering one Tuesday, and starting with a title card showing the date.
Each Tuesday, after visiting James and before returning to Tom, Billie has secret encounters with two older students, Josh and Jasmine, in an apartment Harry allows them to use. Billie films sexual experiments of the threesome.
A setback for James is that he has to stop testosterone injections, because of a rare condition of his body not tolerating it.
After sending a nude photograph of herself to Jasmine, Billie gets into trouble as this is considered child pornography. The school principal, James, Tom and Jasmine strongly disapprove it. Billie is shocked that James destroys one of her tapes, and refuses further contact with him. Josh does not want physical contact with Billie anymore because of Tom's disapproval.
Later Billie is willing to destroy a remaining tape, but since it is in James' house who she no longer visits, she is dependent on Harry, who finally destroys it for her.
When the year is finished, Billie reconciles with James, and starts living with him again. Also Billie, Josh and Jasmine become friends again.
