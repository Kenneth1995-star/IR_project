Bhoomi Malayalam (ഭൂമി മലയാളം)

The movie recounts an incident that took place in Thillenkeri in Kannur district in 1948 April 15. The Communist party was struggling against the rule of Jawaharlal Nehru at that period. In Thillenkeri, comrade Ananthan Master (Suresh Gopi) was the leader of the Communist party.
He was shot dead while he was leading a demonstration against feudals. His wife Meenakshi was pregnant at that time and later gave birth to a baby girl Janaki Amma. Janaki Amma's son is Narayanan Kutty (Suresh Gopi). From the first generation Ananthan to third generation Narayanan Kutty, the film attempts to capture the fear that has been pervading the life of women living in different periods of time, at different places.
