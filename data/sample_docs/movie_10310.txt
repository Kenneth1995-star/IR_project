The Wild Life

The plot revolves around three teenagers living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Bill (Eric Stoltz) has just graduated from high school and got his first apartment. His younger brother Jim, who is fixated on Vietnam and the Vietnam war (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), spends a lot of time practicing with his Nunchakus, getting high, listening to heavy metal on his boombox, and hanging out with Vietnam vet Charlie (Randy Quaid). Other important characters include Tom (Christopher Penn), a hedonistic high-school wrestling champ who works with Bill at a bowling alley, a trendy department store manager named Harry (Rick Moranis), Anita, Bill's ex-girlfriend (Lea Thompson) who works at a donut shop, and her friend Eileen, Tommy's girlfriend (Jenny Wright) who works at the department store with Harry. Anita has a fling with a cop named David (Hart Bochner) who, unknown to Anita, is married. The three boys set out for a night of fun and craziness at a strip bar and later on have a party at Bill's apartment.
