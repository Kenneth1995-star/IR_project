Latha (Rekha), daughter of Menon (K. P. Ummer), a rich businessman gets a threatening call from Raji (Ragini) demanding Rs 5 lakhs not to reveal a deadly secret about her father. Frightened Latha approaches her family advocate Haridas (Janardanan) for a solution. Haridas refers Latha to Captain Hariharan (Mammootty), who now runs a security service. Though initially he is reluctant to take up the investigation on Raji, Haiharan decides to go ahead with it. In the meanwhile Raji is found dead. Inspector Raju Peter suspects Hariharan who informs Latha about the death. Malini (Sobhana), sister of Latha, inquires with Hariharan about Raji, Latha and the reason for the probe, but Hariharan says it's something personal. Meanwhile, Suresh (Vijayaraghavan), their cousin, is found dead too. Hariharanâ€™s probe to find the truth is the rest of the story.
