A Lady Mislaid

Esther (Phyllis Calvert) and her sister Jennifer (Gillian Owen) are spinsters on holiday in a remote country cottage. Things take a dramatic turn when a policeman (Alan White) calls, searching for the body of the former tenant's wife. When a human skeleton is unearthed in a chicken coup, the finger of suspicion points firmly at the previous occupant, Mr. Smith (Thorley Walters).
