Fighting a legal battle for over 10 years in the hope of getting back his land from the forest department, the film narrates the story of Raghu Karhe who, along with his wife, two sons - Panda and Balu, his daughter-in-law and grandson, all wander while shepherding sheep from one village to another.
Balu, a budding wrestler and a daydreamer, foreseeing prosperity and good future in agriculture hopes to find his family a permanent settlement instead of day-to-day wandering.
Fate brings them to a village headed by the rowdy, Ashokrao, who along with his fellow wrestlers terrorizes all the adjoining villages and very often creates trouble by picking up the sheep of poor shepherds. Balu and his family bear everything silently.
In one of the wrestling competitions, Balu defeats Ashokrao's academy's wrestlers, which leads to animosity between him and Balu. Ashokrao compels Balu to a wrestle with his ace wrestler. Feeling the pain of Ashokrao's separatist remarks, Balu applies his full strength and breaks the wrestler's spine and runs away. This further hurts Ashokrao's ego who vows to finish him. Balu's angst for finding resolution culminates in a heart-wrenching climax of the film.
Through its protagonist, the film talks about the entire shepherd community and how their lives are unstable, full of challenges and how at times, they have to pay a heavy price for survival with dignity.[3]
