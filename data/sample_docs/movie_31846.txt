Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, it's the Emperor (Gummadi) is on a vacation and left the administration to his Jagirdar Mahipathi (C.S.R) who is innocent, ineffective and greedy. Taking advantage of his weakness for money, the army chief Prachanda (R. Nageswara Rao) who is cruel and equally greedy, fleeces the people with taxes beyond their ability to pay and usurps their property. In one such incident, he causes the death of Rosaiah (Perumallu), a sick old man who once was a valiant soldier. His son Pratap (N. T. Rama Rao) seeks to avenge his father’s death. He is supported by his friend Jogulu (Relangi) and his sister Mallika (Sowcar Janaki) who nurtured a secret admiration towards him. Along with Jogulu, he inspires a group of youth to revolt against their oppressors. Pratap robs Mahipathi & Prachanda and helps the poor. Prachanda announces a reward for his captors. When Mahipathi’s daughter princess Shobha Devi (Anjali Devi) is on her way to the palace, Jogulu enacts a kidnap drama, Pratap in disguise saves her and introduces himself as Pradeep. Shobha and Pratap are smitten by each other. But Prachanda has designs to marry Shobha. This leads to some comic and some tense situations. The story takes an interesting turn when a veiled person who revealed Shobha later saves Pratap in a piquant situation and later when the emperor in disguise finds the truth behind the chaos in his empire. He imprisons Prachanda and declares Pratap as his heir. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Pratap & Shobha.
