Night Without Stars

When English lawyer Giles Gordon (David Farrar), partially blinded during service in World War II, retires to the French Riviera in 1947, he meets and falls in love with shop girl Alix Delaisse (Nadia Gray), the widow of a French Resistance fighter. Restaurateur Pierre Chava (GÃ©rard Landry) approaches Giles and warns him off with the claim that Alix is already promised to him. He tells Giles that Alix is involved with black marketers, blackmailers and murderers from the war years and demands that Giles forget her and return to England.
