Idhayak Kamalam

The film’s a story of twins — one turns out to be a good girl Kamala (Vijaya) and the other, a wayward woman Vimala (Vijaya again). The mother, on her deathbed, wants the well-behaved girl to forget about her sister who abandons home and becomes involved with a gang of robbers. Kamala’s husband (Ravichandran) is in London studying Law. When she falls ill, the husband is sent for, and she dies in his arms! He erects a memorial for her in his house.
Meanwhile, police inspector (Balajee) arrests a robber’s mistress. She claims to be the wife of the lawyer and the matter goes to court. The lawyer denies she is his wife. But, it turns out she is, in deed, Kamala and that the one who died in his arms was Vimala. The truth comes out and both live happily thereafter.
