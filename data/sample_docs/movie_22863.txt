Lord of Shanghai

In the early 20th century. Xiao Yuegui (Yu Nan) is sold as a maid to a Shanghai brothel, where Madam Dai Yu (Bai Ling) doesn't like her because she has a no-count big foot with big breasts. But soon she becomes a lover of Chang Lixong (Hu Jun), who is the gang leader of Hong society. After meeting with Huang Peiyu (Qin Hao), a leader of the secret society and underground resistance movement Tongmenghui, Chang Lixong is assassinated. Xiao Yuegui becames helpless and then goes to the countryside, where she gives birth to a daughter.[3]
Years later, Xiao Yuegui organizes a theatrical troupe named "Tanhuang Banzi", and she returns to Shanghai. Under the patronage of the second generation lord of Shanghai Huang Peiyu, she rose to prominence. After falling in love with Huang she learns that he was involved in the assassination of her husband Chang Lixiong. Xiao Yuegui persuades Yu Qiyang (Rhydian Vaughan), an attendant to both lords of Shanghai, to promote justice. After Huang's death, Yu Qiyang replaces him to become the third generation lord of Shanghai.[3]
