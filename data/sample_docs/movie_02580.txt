Hawaiian Nights

Hotel mogul's son Ted Hartley simply wants to start his own band, but his father sends him to Hawaii to help run one of his properties there. Ted takes his musicians along and is offered free room and board by Lonnie Lane, the daughter of a rival hotel chain's owner, to perform at her family's inn.
Ted's dad flies over, intending to buy out his rival. He finds out what's going on and intends to put a stop to it, but watching Ted's band perform makes him appreciate that his son actually has found his true calling.
