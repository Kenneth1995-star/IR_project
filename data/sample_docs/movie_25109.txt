Bombay 405 Miles

Ordered to stay away from Delhi's border for several years, two convicts, Kishan and Kanhaiya, decide to hitch a ride through a goods train to Bombay. While on this train, they come to the rescue of an elderly male with a female child, Munni. On his last breath, the elderly male asks them to take care of Munni as millions of rupees are involved. Greed overtakes both and they take the child with them in order to locate her next of kin. Unable to find anyone they advertise in the newspapers, and demand a hefty sum from Veer Singh, who answered the advertisement. What Kishan and Kanhaiya don't know that is that officially Munni is already dead, along with her mother, and brother, purportedly killed by their father, Ranvir Singh, when he suspected his wife's fidelity. Kishan and Kanhaiya find themselves immersed in a web of lies and deceit as they try to fathom what the truth really is. But before they could get to the bottom of this matter, their lives themselves are under threat - by a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.
