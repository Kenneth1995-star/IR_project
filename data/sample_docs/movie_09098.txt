The Voyage

Set in Sicily in the years leading up to World War I, Adriana De Mauro (Sophia Loren) loves Cesar Braggi (Richard Burton), but Cesar, honoring his father's dying wish, allows his brother Antonio (Ian Bannen) to marry her. As fate wills, Antonio dies in an automobile accident. Adriana's mourning for Antonio ends when Cesar steps in to rekindle her lust of life. Soon, Adriana begins having dizzy spells. Cesar helps her to a specialist, and the diagnosis is not good. She has an incurable disease. For the rest of their time together, Cesar woos Adriana and eventually proposes to her on a gondola. Yet Signora De Mauro (Barbara Pilavin), Adriana's mother is not pleased with the relationship and argues bitterly with Cesar and stands in the way.
