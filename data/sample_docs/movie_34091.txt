The Suit

Three youngster living in a small coastal town at the Black Sea spend their time roving about. Some day they discover a black pinstriped Gucci suit in the window of a fashion shop in the big city, where they have to go by ferry. They plan to obtain this specific suit in order to appear as successful and confident adults once they wear it. After a couple of efforts, they manage to acquire the suit and agree to take turns wearing it.
Shtyr puts the suit on to upgrade his image. Wearing the suit, he easily creeps into the champagne reception of a luxury cruise ship, and later he tries to have a talk with his father, who left the family long ago and works as a sophisticated tailor in town.
Geka wears the suit hoping to gain respect from his step mother Asya, who apparently is cheating his father by dating other guys. On the one hand he detests Asya for her more or less obvious sluttishness, on the other hand he appears to be attracted by her.
Mute uses the suit to impress Dina, a beautiful jewish fishmonger he became fond of, but is only used by her in order to get rid of a bothersome man named Artur.
The efforts of all three juveniles wearing the suit end in tragedy.
