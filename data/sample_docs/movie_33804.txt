Assassination Classroom

Earth is threatened by an enormously powerful octopus-like monster who destroyed 70% of the Moon, permanently rending it into the shape of a crescent. The monster claims that within a year he will destroy the Earth, but he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate. In class 3-E; the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, he starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion (i.e. 100 million USD) to whoever among the students succeeds in killing the monster, whom they have named "Koro-sensei" (殺せんせー, Korosensē, a pun on korosenai (殺せない, unkillable) and sensei (先生, teacher)). However, this proves to be an almost impossible task, as not only does he have several superpowers at his disposal, including the capacity of moving at Mach 20, but he is also the best teacher they've ever had, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and perspectives for the future.
As the series goes on, the entire situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher, including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the year term. The series is narrated by Nagisa Shiota, one of the pupils in the class whose main strategy in killing Koro-sensei is making a list of all his weaknesses. At first Nagisa appears to be one of the weaker members of Class 3-E, but he later emerges as one of the most skilful assassins in the class.
