Kovilpatti Veeralakshmi

The film is about a brave woman who is battling against untouchability in a village. Casteism is a curse for Veeralakshmi (Simran) and her ilk, who undergo unbearable torture on account of their being Dalits. However this time it is not from the upper castes but from a brutally inhuman police force. It is a village where the inspector of police is the feudal lord. He beats up the poor men and rapes their women — and the rest of his menials in the force enjoy the leftovers. Subjugated to an unbearable extent, Veeralakshmi rises in revolt.
