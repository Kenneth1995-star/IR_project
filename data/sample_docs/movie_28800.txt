Ringan

It is the heart-warming journey of father and son; the endearing pursuit of a 7-year old boy to find his dead mother, innocently mistaking her to be at God's abode and the tireless plight of his father, a farmer stuck in the vicious circle of drought and debt. With no one else to turn to, they travel to Pandharpur, Godâ€™s abode, where each thinks they will find what they seek. But this search tests their harmony, morality, integrity and faith. Will this physical and emotional quest help them find a way to mend their bond? And will the underdog father and son redeem themselves to find a way out of this cycle of misfortune and emerge victorious?
