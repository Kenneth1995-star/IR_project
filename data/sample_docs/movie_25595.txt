Ek Ghar

Arriving in the city with a hope to find a cosy little home, Rajanna and Geeta are happy when they find one such house. One day, they find a workshop opening up next door. Rajanna is indignant at the noises coming from the workshop, but he is helpless. Geeta, meanwhile, gets the shed vacated with the help of the police inspector. Rajanna seeks the help of the workmen who had earlier occupied the shed to take Geeta away from the environment. But she discovers that their slum is being demolished to make way for a multinational.[1]
