The Constant Husband

A man (Rex Harrison) wakes up in a hotel room in Wales, suffering from amnesia. He has no recollection of who he is or where he comes from. With the help of mental specialist Doctor Llewellyn (Cecil Parker), he manages to trace himself back to his wife and home in London, but soon discovers that she is just one of his many wives in his many homes all over the country.
