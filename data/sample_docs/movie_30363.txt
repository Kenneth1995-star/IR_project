James Pandu

James (Prabhu Deva) and Pandu (Parthiban) are porters. Though they were inseparable friends before there is no love lost between them now. James is in love with Renu (Renu Desai) while Kousalya (Kousalya), a mute, has feelings for Pandu. The owner of a chit fund company ('Nizhalgal' Ravi) hires James to 'steal' a bag of money from himself so he could abscond with the money. But his manager ('Thalaivasal' Vijay) hires Pandu to steal the bag from James. When James and Pandu lay their hands on the money, they become friends again and decide to split the money. But the chit fund owner is found murdered and they become the prime suspects. In the climax, Mouli comes to court and tell the truth that he only killed Ravi because he would cheat many people. James and Pandu are proven innocent.[2]
