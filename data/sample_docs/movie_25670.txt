Balwaan

Arjun Singh (Sunil Shetty) comes from a very poor family. He lives in a small and shabby tenement with his mom and sister. He was studying in a college where he falls in love with Deepa (Divya Bharti). One day he attacks a police officer and gets sent to prison for that. Deepa bails him from jail with the help of her father (Tinnu Anand), who is a police commissioner. Deepa's father wants Arjun to join the police force as he feels that the department needs some honest officers. He joins the police force and gets posted to another city where the original police inspector was killed by the goons. He goes to the city along with his Mother and Sister. This puts him into conflict with Bhai (Danny Denzongpa), a notorious gangster. In order to teach Arjun a lesson, Bhai orders people in this community to stop interacting with Arjun and his family, and as a result the three are alienated. His sister is raped, and his mother passes away. Then Bhai has Arjun captured and chained. But Arjun manages to escape, only to find that he has been framed for murder and is arrested by the police.
