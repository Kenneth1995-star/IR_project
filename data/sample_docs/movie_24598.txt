Hamara Ghar

Children from different social backgrounds and ethnicity are travelling on a steamer bound for Goa. When they are marooned on a deserted island, they get together and build a shelter called Hamara Ghar (Our House). Several incidents take place like a near-drowning, discovery of hidden treasure, different factions in the group, which are all dealt with in a spirit of togetherness. However, despondency soon settles in, and they wait to be rescued. Finally a search helicopter finds them and they leave the island, with their shelter, Hamar Ghar, still standing.
