Double Bunk

The newlyweds Jack (Ian Carmichael) and Peggy (Janette Scott), facing eviction from their flat in London, are tricked into buying a rundown houseboat by its current owner Alfred Harper (Reginald Beckwith) and his put-upon wife (Irene Handl). Mr Watson (Dennis Price) owns Jack and Peggy’s mooring, and soon makes their acquaintance by introducing them to his mooring tariffs and associated surcharges.
After rebuilding the engine with the help of a friend, Sid (Sid James), a used-car salesman, Jack and Peggy take the boat down the River Thames to Ramsgate, with Sid and his girlfriend Sandra (Liz Fraser) along as passengers. On the way they get into trouble with an official from the Thames Conservancy (Naunton Wayne) and also with a member of the river police (Terry Scott).
After Sandra's transistor radio gets misplaced next to the compass they manage to end up in Calais. With no fuel or supplies they have to resort to desperate actions to get themselves and the houseboat back home. Sandra puts on a striptease for Watson, who also happens to be in Calais, to enable Jack and Sid to borrow some of Watson’s fuel and food. The next morning they follow Watson back across the Channel, as their own compass is broken, and end up entering into a wager with Watson on who can get back to their mooring first. They win the bet when Watson's boat runs aground
