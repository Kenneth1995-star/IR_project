Beautiful fledgeling actress Stephanie Blake (Lois Maxwell) is starring in playwright Otto Kellner's (Eric Pohlman) latest theatrical hit. Unbeknownst to her, the writer is in love with her, and is jealous of any competition. Stephanie is ambitious for a part in a new play by American Bill Lang (Dale Robertson), but Kellner refuses to release her from her contract. When Kellner is found stabbed with a pair of Stephanie's scissors, Bill Lang fears she is being framed and so aids her in moving the body. But when the police discover the corpse, everyone becomes a suspect.
