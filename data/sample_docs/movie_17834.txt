Charlie (Terry Rogers) is the good-looking, hard-working brother who runs Uncle Vito's cafe, as well as the local soccer club. He enjoys casual success with women, but is careful to avoid commitment. The other brother,[1] Frank (Peter Evangelista) is an unemployed dreamer who studies the Joga Bonito, Total Football and Johan Cruyff, while functioning as the coach of their suburban football team. For Charlie it is all about winning;[2] for Frank it is all about the pursuit of excellence.[3]
Meanwhile, their suburban team is made up of old school friends who have a range of issues of their own. Damon (Peter Michell) is married to Isabella (Elena Carapetis), who is slowly turning her ocker husband into an Italian. Angelo (Sam Tripodi) is married to Lisa (Kimberley Hart); she wants him to focus on starting a family. Kon (Frank Romeo) and Mark (Saxon Cordeaux) are slackers; they work for Sarah (Chloe Gardner), who fancies Charlie. And Charlie fancies Katie (Georgii Speakman), the unattainable sexy blonde with a secret.
The guys are all approaching the end of their football careers. Family responsibilities, age and business pressures combine to make this their last season together and they would love to go out as champions. To this end, they embrace serious training and adopt a few questionable tactics. When Uncle Vito (Gabriel Damiani), the godfather of the piece, backs the boys to win the cup to the tune of $50,000, the tensions increase. As the team closes in on an elusive place in the Cup final, Charlie discovers true love, but has to decide if Katie is the kind of girl he can safely take home to mother.
Woven through all this is the progress[4] of the Socceroos[5] at the 2006 World Cup finals,[6] with the steady success[7][8] of the Australian team generating enthusiasm[9] amongst Australians[10] who traditionally had no interest in soccer,[11] and increasing inspiration for the boys.
"It's a fun film", said the producer, Matt Salleh. "One that's character-driven, hopefully by characters who resonate with people."[12]
