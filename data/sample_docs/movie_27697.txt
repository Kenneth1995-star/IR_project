Sukrutham

Mammootty plays journalist Ravishankar who is a victim of blood cancer. The knowledge of his disease and the death on its way hugely disappoints him and he loses all his hope in life. He forces his wife Malini (Gauthami) to get involved with their friend Rajendran (Manoj K Jayan) so that she won't be alone after Ravi's death. Ravi goes back to his village where his cousin, Durga (Shanthii Krishna) who is still unmarried starts taking care of him.
Meanwhile a doctor who is a friend of Ravishankar convinces him to undergo holistic treatment at his centre. The centre is driven by a theme that each and every cell in our body has a mind which decides whether the body it belongs to should live or die. The treatment does wonders to Ravi and he is on his way to recovery and final checkups confirm that his blood count is normal. Ravi is delighted to come back to his life; but everything in his hope and joy of life is squandered when he learns that his recovery is a blow to all his relatives including his wife, who by now has started sleeping with Rajendran. He feels resentment again when he learns that his death was more awaited than his recovery.
Ravi finally commits suicide after his childhood sweetheart Durga also leaves him, and he reads his obituary in his office.
The final line to the audience is the old message that death is the ultimate truth, an inevitable part of life and is in its own way a moment to rejoice.
