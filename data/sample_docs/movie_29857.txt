Durgaa

Durga (Baby Shamili) is the only daughter of a wealthy couple. After her father’s early death, Durga's uncle (kitty) tries to abduct all the wealth and kills Durga’s mother (Sathyapriya). Kitty also plans to kill Durga but she escapes with the help of her pets - a monkey (Ramu) and a dog (Raja). Durga meets Muthu (Nizhalgal Ravi), an innocent guy and befriends him. Kannamma (Kanaka) is a karakattam dancer and she falls in love with Muthu and they both decide to help Durga.
Meanwhile Kitty searches for Durga to kill her so that he can enjoy the wealth. Durga returns to her home along with Muthu and Kannamma which shocks Kitty as Durga is protected by them now. Surprisingly Kitty meets Malliga (Baby Shamili - dual role), a look alike of Durga. Malliga is the daughter of a poor physically challenged guy (Vaagai Chandrasekhar). Kitty forces Malliga to act as Durga by threatening to kill her father, so that he can create chaos between the two and in the process he can kill the real Durga.
Finally there comes a situation where both Durga and Malliga have to walk over the fire in a temple to prove their real identity. Durga successfully walks over the fire. But before Malliga starts walking, her father comes and rescues her. He also informs about Kitty’s plans to everyone and Kitty gets arrested. In the end, Durga accepts Malliga in her house. Muthu and Kannamma also stay with them.
