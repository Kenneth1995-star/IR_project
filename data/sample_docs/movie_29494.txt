Pattikaattu Ponnaiya

Somewhere between the Tamil campaign and its capital.
As the farmer Ponnaiya (MGR) puts a lot with a big seriousness into fields, that he takes to heart responsibility that his father, Nathamai Nalasivam (Chittor V. Nagaiah) delegates to him, as the twin younger brother of Ponnaiya, Muthaiya (MGR), studying in agronomy, lets go itself, does not really get involved in its studies, because its spirit is monopolized somewhere else...
Muthaiya who gives no more the news, worries his family.
Ponnaiya who absolutely has to pay off a big debt in Pannaiyar Paramasivam (M. N. Nambiar), rises towards the capital to earn money and especially find his brother Muthaiya.
Once arrived in the big city, Ponnaiya saves a master-fighter (S. A. Ashokan) of several aggressors.
By way of thanks, this one teaches him all the threads of the wrestling.
Ponnaiya wins in reputation and in fortune.
