Baap Re Baap

Ashok has just returned from abroad after seven years, and now lives with his overly protective parents. His one sneeze is treated as if he has pneumonia. After Ashok hears the singing of a flower-girl named Kokila, he falls in love with her. His parents are busy trying to find a suitable bride for him. For this purpose they give an advertisement, which attracts people from various states with differing languages. They all land up at Ashok's house. His parents settle for the beautiful Roopa, who comes from a wealthy family (Ulhas and Leela Mishra). Ashok runs away from home and makes his intentions to marry Kokila known to his parents. His mother relents, but his father (Jayant) refuses to budge. With the help of his mother and some planning, Ashok brings Kokila into the house as his bride and his father finally gives his consent.
