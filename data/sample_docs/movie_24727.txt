Jeevanlal, who is a thief, lives in a small village in India. He is married to Sita and together they have a daughter Meena and a son, Dharmchand (Dharma). One day, Jeevanal burgles the Tehsildar's house, and then hides the stolen property with Dharmchand at the family home. When the police arrive, Dharmchand gives up the stolen property. Jeevanlal is arrested, found guilty and sent to prison. Years later, Jeevanlal remains angry at Dharma. One day, Jeevanlal and Dharma fight over the sale of a cow. Jeevanlal strikes Dharma who takes up a stick in self defense. Sita intervenes, scolding Dharma for daring to attack his father. She tells Dharma to leave. Dharma moves to Bombay, and finds work with a building contractor. He sends his savings to his mother. Later, Sita receives a letter from Dharma saying that he is about to return. When she goes to the bus-stop to greet him she is told that he has already gone to the family home. When she returns home, she is shocked to find her husband lying dead in a pool of blood and her son standing over the body with a bloodied axe. The police arrest Dharma and he is held on trial for murder. It is then that the truth of the matter between father and son is revealed.
