Amiri Garibi

A wealthy Bombay-based industrialist, Kedarnath, travels to a small town where his childhood friend, Narayan, resides. He meets with him, his wife, Laxmi, and their daughter, Rani. He proposes that Rani marries his son, Rajesh, and move with him to the city. Narayan and Laxmi are overjoyed, and soon a marriage takes place. When Rani reaches Kedarnath's house, she is not at all welcomed by her mother-in-law, Sheila, nor her husband, and his sisters, Jyoti and Pinky. She is ill-treated, belittled, slapped and humiliated on every possible occasion.
Then the unexpected happens, Jyoti happens to be a child bride, married to a poor Bhardwaj family. Now Deepak Bhardwaj has grown up and has come to claim Jyoti as his wife, and moves into their house, much to the chagrin of Jyoti, Rajesh, Pinky, and Sheila. Tragedy follows as Kedarnath passes away, leaving Rani and Deepak to the mercy of Sheila, who loses no time in turning the tables on them and asking them to leave the house. She is now busy preparing Rajesh's marriage to a young woman named Sona, who is not only rich but also beautiful and is ready to come to her home with a huge dowry. What Sheila does not know that Sona has her own agenda and plan - which do not include Sheila at all.
