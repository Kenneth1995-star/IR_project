Achanak

Major Ranjeet Khanna (Vinod Khanna) is in love with his wife Pushpa (Lily Chakravarty), who seems to love him as well. His commanding officer, also his father-in-law Lt Col Bakshi, is played by Iftekhar. Ranjeet is happy with his marriage, until he finds out about his wife's affair with his best friend. He kills them both and turns himself in to the police. Then, he escapes from the police to find the Ganges River, because he wanted to fulfill his wife's wish of dropping her wedding necklace (mangalsutra) into the river. However, the police shoot him first and he is hospitalized, where he becomes emotionally attached to the doctors (Om Shivpuri, Asrani) and the nurse (Farida Jalal), who are also devastated when he is sentenced to hang to death.
