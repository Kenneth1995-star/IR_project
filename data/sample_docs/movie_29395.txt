Galatta Kalyanam

Madan (Sivaji Ganesan) and Lalitha (Jayalalitha) are in love with each other. She is the second daughter of a businessman, Dharmalingam (Thangavelu). While seeking her hand in marriage, Dharmalingam lays down a condition that all his daughters’ weddings are to be held simultaneously thereby entrusting Madan with the unenviable task of finding suitable grooms for his other daughters. Madan seeks the help of his friend, Chandran (Nagesh) in his mission. Madan, however, soon realises that he has a Herculean task ahead of him – the eldest daughter Rathna (Manorama) is averse to marriage. The others have their own tastes and preferences. After encountering a lot of difficulties, they manage to find grooms for all of them. However, on the wedding eve, one of the grooms goes missing. After tracing the gang, Madan fights them to rescue the groom and finally all pairs get married.
