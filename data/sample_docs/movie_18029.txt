Aru marries Muhib without the consent from any of the family. After marriage they go to Muhib's friend 's place. Muhib tries to manage a job for him while Aru's family thinks otherwise and the story turns into a new way.[5]
The story revolves around the love-story of Muhib and Oru where both being together are not together. Muhib is brought up in his brother-in-law’s home with his sister. Muhib and his sister came from a rural family. His sister got married to an elite bourgeoisie man, who is too strict at his rules and too robotic, rather than humane. His sister and brother-in-law have one daughter named Sara. The family seems fine, yet lacks of love and affection. Muhib is always afraid of his brother-in-law who is fatherlike in rudeness, without any single affection. Being in love with Oru, Muhib married her without informing anyone all of a sudden. Oru’s family didn’t know as well. Just after their marriage, Muhib’s brother-in-law offered him a job out of the city. On his way, he had a terrible car accident which brought disaster to all and twisted the stream of all characters. Muhib’s sister, being shocked, for the first time, raised voice against her husband and insulted him about his non-human behaviour all through the life. On the other hand, Oru’s family already fixed a groom for Oru and they were unknown of Oru’s marriage with Muhib. However, in the end, when Oru was informed about the accident, she couldn’t help but reveal their secret marriage. At first it was thought that Oru’s marriage with Muhib should never be revealed as Oru must start a new life. But Oru, when heard the news, rushed to the hospital and desired to be Muhib’s wife forever waiting for his return from Coma.
