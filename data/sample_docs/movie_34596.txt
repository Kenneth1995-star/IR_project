One Perfect Day

A man named Un-cheol (Yoon Kye-sang) is looking for a girlfriend. He goes on a series of unsuccessful dates, culminating in a disastrous blind date with Yoo-jin (Park Soo-jin), and his awkward banter, stupid jokes, and complete insensitivity to her feelings, leads Yoo-jin to ditch him while they're playing the game Rock-paper-scissors.[10] In a flashback to Un-cheol's childhood, his father had taught him Rock-paper-scissors and given him some life lessons. As Un-cheol morosely wanders the streets that night, he finds a missing dog, which he returns to its owner, Eun-hee (Park Shin-hye). She insists on giving him a monetary reward, but instead, he asks her to play Rock-paper-scissors with himâ€”if he wins, she goes on a date with him, but if he loses or it's a draw, he walks away and never bothers her again.
