Periya Thambi

Siva (Prabhu) lives with his father Soundarapandian (Thalaivasal Vijay), a police officer, and his little sister Geetha. Geetha gets engaged and Siva notes that his father will not invite his family to the wedding. Hence, Siva finds out his family's village and goes there. At his father's village, Siva is insulted by his uncle Sankarapandian (Vijayakumar), while his aunt Kamachi (Vadivukkarasi) welcomes him. Soon, Kamachi's daughter Selvi (Nagma) and Siva fall in love with each other. How Siva reconciles his uncle and marries Selvi forms the rest of the story.
