Healing

A man named Viktor Kahdem has almost given up on life because he has been sentenced to a low-security prison farm with a non-threatening environment where it still seems like some individuals can be reformed. At Won Wron, a case worker named Matt Perry has established a special kind of program to rehabilitate broken men by giving them the responsibility for rehabilitating injured raptors. Against all odds, Viktor meets Matt and becomes his number one test case and is introduced to Yasmine, the majestic wedge tailed eagle with a 2-metre wingspan. If these two can tame each other, anything is possible.
