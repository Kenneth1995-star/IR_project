Vakratunda Mahakaaya

A bomb has been planted in a Ganesha soft toy by an unknown terrorist organization. The plan goes haywire when Altaf, a street kid, accidentally picks it up and runs away with it. Altaf develops a bond with the likeness of the elephant headed God, but soon he is whisked away by the cops along with his thief friend, Paplu. Ganesha is left behind alone on a park bench, though only for a short while. He sets off on a journey with people from different paths of life. They all treat him like god, but use him to fulfil their desires at the same time, oblivious to the fact that there is a ticking bomb inside. Ganesha, the omniscient observer continues his journey to salvation.
