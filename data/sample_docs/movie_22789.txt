Little Door Gods

Yu Lei and Shen Tu, ancient Han Chinese door gods, have for many years guarded almost nothing instead. Only one door remains under their protection. The brothers are on the brink of being downsized by the Spirit World's new management. They are, along with all the gods, seen as irrelevant by the humans who once traded worship for their protective presence at each set of double entrance doors. Yu Lei, upon hearing of the true reason the humans have forgotten the gods, swears to release the shapeshifting Nian from the three seals it was imprisoned within long ago. Shen Tu, left behind in his brother's fury, sets out to stop him.
Meanwhile, a little girl named Raindrop, Rain for short, returns with her mother to the little town in which three generations of her grandmothers have kept a little restaurant serving only wonton soup; the restaurant's doors are the only ones the immortal brothers still guard. When first Yu Lei and then Shen Tu enter the world of the humans, the barrier between humans and spirit worlds is broken.
