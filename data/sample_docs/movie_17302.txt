9/11

On the morning of September 11, 2001, a messenger sings "Happy Birthday to You" to his daughter, a billionaire argues with his wife in a divorce hearing, a maintenance man begins his day, and a young Russian decides she's breaking up with her sugar daddy. When the first plane hits the World Trade Center, these five elevator passengers find themselves trapped. Forced to band together, they fight against all odds to escape before the imminent and inevitable collapse occurs.
Based on Patrick James Carson's award-winning play Elevator, which premiered in October 2011 at the Red Barn Theater of Tucson, Arizona.
