Hochchheta ki

Hochheta Ki is the story of a medical representative (chhaposha Bangalibabu) who falls in love with another woman four years into his marriage. That may not be a problem; the problem is the way he looks into the camera and starts telling the story of his life. The two girls are Gharwali (Paoli Dam) and Baharwali (Arunima Ghosh).
