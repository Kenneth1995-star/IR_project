Bounty Hunters

It all start with martial arts expert San (Lee Min-ho) and master sleuth Yo (Wallace Chung) who have been working as bodyguards-for-hire but to little success since their dismissal as Interpol officers a year ago. When a vague commission leads them to a hotel room in Incheon, South Korea, a terrorist bombing duly takes place and turns the bumbling investigators into wanted suspects. Their informant dies at the scene, but the pair also immediately find themselves pursued by a rival group of bounty hunters. After an exhilarating if rather unnecessary car chase, San and Yo join forces with a trio: bossy heiress Cat (Tiffany Tang) on an anti-terrorist mission since her lost childhood, tech guru Swan (Karena Ng)who is the resident hacker and maker of fantastic gadgets, and the muscled Babe (Louis Fan). To clear their names, they must work with the trio to track down the culprit of a series of bombings that have plagued an international hotel group.
