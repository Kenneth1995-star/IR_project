Sathriyan

ACP Panneer Selvam a.k.a. Sathriyan (Vijayakanth), an honest cop, gathers enough evidence against a local goon Arumai Nayagam a.k.a. Annachi (Thilakan). Annachi is sent to prison. Annachi avenges his arrest by killing Sathriyan's wife Jaya (Revathi). Since then, Sathriyan quits the police force and takes care of his children, renting an apartment owned by V. K. Ramaswamy. Banu (Bhanupriya), V. K. Ramaswamy's granddaughter, gets introduced to Sathriyan's children and starts mingling with them, eventually falling in love with Sathriyan. Meanwhile, Annachi is released from the prison and realizes that he doesn't carry the same respect as he used to before going to jail. His anger against Sathriyan doesn't cease. Annachi challenges Sathriyan to join the police again and try to fight him again. Sathriyan initially rejects the offer. Annachi tries to provoke Sathriyan by attacking his home and son. Out of frustration over his son's attack, Sathriyan joins the police again and fights Annachi again. Sathriyan's fight against Annachi forms the rest of the plot.
