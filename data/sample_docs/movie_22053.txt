The Delicate Art of Parking

Lonny Goosen (Dov Tiefenbach) is a documentary filmmaker whose car just got towed. Together with his friend Gus (Andrew McNee) as his camera-man and Gus' cousin Olena (Diana Pavlovsk√°) as their sound person, Lonny sets out to make a film about what people think about parking enforcers.
