A Lawless Street

The marshal of Medicine Bend, Calem Ware (Randolph Scott), tries to keep peace in a lawless town whilst trying to prevent himself from being killed. The arrival of a show troupe reunites the marshal with someone from his past, leading to a showdown with his would-be killers and his old flame, Tally Dickinson (Angela Lansbury).
