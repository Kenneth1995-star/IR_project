Pattathu Raani

Jalagandeswaran (Goundamani) and Rayappan (Senthil) are brothers and house owners of a small colony. The tenants refuse to pay up their rents, knowing that the houses were built on State land. Rayappan has the idea to rent a vacant house to Usha (Gouthami), a beautiful company manageress. Usha is married to a middle-aged man Sundaram (Vijayakumar). The couple move into their new house and befriend with the neighbours. The married neighbours Jalagandeswaran, Viswanathan (Janagaraj), Ganesan (Delhi Ganesh) and Coimbatore (Manivasagam) fall in love with the beautiful Usha. They begin to woo the young woman. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
