Mr. and Mrs. Sadachari

The Sadachari famlily is a middle-class Maharashtrian family, with a mother, father, and two sons. Jiva is the tame, docile one, who is a straight-A student, while Shiva (Vaibbhav Tatwawdi) is a hot-headed, street-smart altruistic boy, who idolizes Shivaji Maharaj. Shiva Sadachari, as you may have guessed, is not academically inclined. Shiva’s father (Mohan Joshi) has given up on him, and the father-son have a strained relationship. Shiva avoids his father, college, and responsibilities, among other things. Shiva falls in love with Gargi (Prarthana Behere), who happens to be his best friend Dattu’s sister. Dattu doesn’t agree with this at first, but being a side-character, he doesn’t have much of a choice but to give in. After a few saccharine-sweet romantic days, Gargi and Shiva have a huge fight, in which Gargi (sort of) walks out on Shiva. In fits of rage, they both agree to marry different people, who are brought into their lives by their respective parents. A few twists and turns later. Are they able to reconcile their differences and come back together? forms the crux of story.[6]
