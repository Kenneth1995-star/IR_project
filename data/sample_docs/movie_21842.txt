Robin Crew (Olivia d'Abo) is a high school student who used to be a champion gymnast until she suffered a knee injury in the car accident which killed her father. She continues to train on her own and makes her school's gymnastics team, despite outside pressures from her step-father and the other gymnasts. Robin does, however, receive support from her mother and her new boyfriend (Keanu Reeves), as the crucial gymnastics meet approaches.
