Disco Dancer

Anil (Mithun Chakraborty), a street performer from the Bombay slums and a wedding singer, is scarred by the memory of the rich P.N. Oberoi (Om Shivpuri) beating his mother (Gita Siddharth) in an incident during his childhood. When David Brown, the manager (Om Puri) is fed up of Indian disco current champion's tantrums Sam (Karan Razdan) and looks for some new talent, he happens to watch Anil dance-walking across a street. Rebranded as 'Jimmy', the rising disco star must take the throne from Sam and win the heart of Rita (Kim Yashpal), Oberoi's daughter.
All seems to be going well until Oberoi hires men to connect Jimmy's electric guitar to 5,000 volts of electricity, causing Jimmy's mother to die in a tragic accident. Jimmy gets guitar phobia after witnessing his mothers death. Later, Oberoi's goons break his legs. With help from Rita, Jimmy begins to walk.
Jimmy must claim first place for Team India at the International Disco Dancing Competition amidst strong competition from Team Africa (Disco King and Queen) and Team Paris (Disco King and Queen). Jimmy is reluctant to dance, but Rita persuades him to do so. Sam arrives with a guitar to scare Jimmy. Rita manages to drag the show to encourage Jimmy to sing, but to no avail. The crowd pelts him with stones which hit his head. A person arrives and advices him to infuse his mother and his music; he throws the guitar to him, after which he begins to sing. Oberoi's goons kill the person, after which Jimmy travels to their lair and beats them up. In the ensuing fight, Oberoi is electrocuted.
