Cold Feet

Kenny, a psycho-killer with mommy issues, Monte, a charming crooked cowboy & Maureen, Monte's beautiful oversexed wife to be, steal some jewels and attempt to smuggle them across the border. But they had to hide them where else... in a horse. But Monte isn't the sharing or the marrying type of person. To prove it, he saddles up, steals the horse and the jewels, & heads for his brother Buck's ranch in Montana. When both Kenny & Maureen see that Monte ran off with the horse & jewels, they go after their partner in crime across the country in hot pursuit.
