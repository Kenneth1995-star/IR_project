Printed Indian currency, from the Reserve Bank of India security press at Nasik with an estimated value of ₹ 10 billion, is stolen by Vikram (Salim Ghouse), a gangster living in London. The container is shipped off from a goods carrier en route to New Delhi, through Vikram's henchman. The access card of the container is in the possession of pop star Chandralekha (Anu Aggarwal). CBI Superintendent of Police Laxminarayanan IPS (S. P. Balasubramaniam) is assigned to track down the stolen currency, which had already been attested by the governor of the Reserve Bank of India. On her way to Vikram, Chandralekha comes across two burglars Kadhir (Anand) and Azhagu (Prashanth) who are on the run from the police—having in tow country-girl Rasathi (Heera Rajagopal) whom they kept from committing suicide and who then ran away from her ruthless uncle. Laxminarayan's assignment will lead him to Ashok Tejani, and then the two burglars, who are on the run from the Police along with the suicidal village belle. His efforts will be frustrated even more after Ashok is killed and his girlfriend Chandralekha, is absconding; and the entry of the international drug dealer himself, simply known as Vikram, who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the loot. After some attempts of cheating each other Chandralekha is making friends with the thieves. When she discovers that Vikram is stopping at nothing—especially not at dead bodies—on his hunt after the loot, she informs the three others about the real value of the code card. In the following pursuit between Vikram, the four heroes and a special police brigade, which has to get back the money before a state crisis comes about, there is not only fierce action, but also love comes to its own.
