Nutan Prasad is a wealthy man whose son marries against his wishes and settles in Bombay with his kids (Chiranjeevi and Deepa) who grow up in an ultra-modern culture. Bhargav (Chiranjeevi) has a maradalu, Geetha back in their village and Nuthan Prasad wants both of them to get married.
When he goes to Bombay with the marriage proposal, he finds out that Chiru is no mood to marry a Village belle and that he has already been trapped in the net of an opportunistic girl, Seema. Nuthan Prasad poses as a rich old man and romances with Seema.
The money-minded Seema wants to marry the old man and leaves the frustrated Chiru in lurch. Once Chiru realizes what the real character of Seema is, he agrees to marry Geetha. [3]
