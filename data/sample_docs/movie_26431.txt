Chhodon Naa Yaar

Ravi (Jimmy Sheirgill), Shiv (Kabir Sadanand) and Sunny (Farid Amiri), three final year students from a Delhi Mass Com College decided to make their diploma film about a myth which was prevalent in the northern hills of India. But, they did not know that the myth would turn out to be the truth.
Ravi planned the trip against the wishes of his girlfriend Rashmi (Kim Sharma) and college professor Saxena (Ahmed Khan) as both of them thought it to be a dangerous trip. However, Sunny eagerly joined the trip considering it as a fun trip. It was surely fun when they began... But as they got deeper into the jungle their courage and beliefs were put to test.
