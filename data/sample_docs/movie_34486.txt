Mi-ran, a beautiful dance student (Park Hyun-jin), becomes the model, muse and lover of her philandering sculptor-professor Jun-hyuk (Lee Sung-jae). When Mi-ran realizes that she will never be more than a model for Jun-hyuk, she leaves him for her stalker-cum-fellow student Min-woo (Kim Ji-hoon).
The story takes place 10 years later, when Min-woo and Jun-hyuk reunite as art critic and interviewee, and the two compare their conflicting memories of Mi-ran, who seems to have since disappeared.
