The Major

Police Major Sergei Sobolev's wife is in labour. The future father rushes to the hospital, but then his car hits, at full speed, a boy who was crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing, causing his death. The only witness is the boy's mother, Irina Gutorova.
The Major decides to avoid responsibility for the crime and call his colleagues to the incident scene. His colleague Pavel Korshunov quickly eliminates the evidence that proves Sobolev's guilt. Despite the fact that the mother of the deceased 7-year-old boy knows the true culprit of the accident, the Chief of District police forced her to give false testimony in favour of Major Sobolev.
Subsequently, Sobolev decides to confess everything and to be punished, but the other police officers do not like the idea: after all, in covering the major, they cover traces of their own abuse, in this modernized yet still corrupted police force.
