Sira` Fi al-Wadi (Struggle in the Valley)

Omar Sharif plays Ahmed, an engineer whose father (played by Abdel Waress Assar) is a farmer and a farm owner. His father succeeds in improving and increasing the production of sugar cane in his farm. Taher Pasha, a wealthy land owner, who runs a competing sugar cane production facility, feels threatened by his recent production prosperity. Ahmed is in a love relationship with the pasha's daughter, Amal, but as a consequence to the rivalry between both their fathers, he is compelled to hide their relationship.[1][3][4][5]
The pasha learns of a heated dispute that started between Ahmed's father and one of his partners and finds this to be his perfect chance. He plans a crime and a conspiracy against Ahmed's father. The next day, the partner is found murdered in the farm, and Ahmed's father is suspected to be the murderer, especially after his quarrel with the victim. He is blamed for the crime and sentenced to death. Ahmed learns of a witness of this crime, but after looking for him, he discovers that he was killed in a mysterious accident. Ahmed's father is executed and his partner's son, Selim, seeks revenge for his father's death. He searches for Ahmed for retribution. Ahmed, fearing his death, hides in an ancient temple in the desert.[1][3][4][5]
Meanwhile, a relative of the pasha asks the pasha for the hand of his daughter, Amal, but the pasha refuses and rejects his offer. Angered, he kills the pasha and reveals the truth of the murder to the police. After knowing the truth of his father's true murderer, Selim apologizes to Ahmed. Ahmed returns to his love and marries her.[1][3][4][5]
