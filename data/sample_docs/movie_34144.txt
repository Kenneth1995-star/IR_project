Nothing Personal

Private detective Vladimir Zimin receives an order for video surveillance of an apartment. Having successfully installed the bugs and micro-cameras, he begins surveillance. Soon it turns out that the owner of the apartment, Irina, works in a drugstore and suffers from an unsettled personal life. Zimin begins to doubt that anyone can be so interested in the life of this lonely woman, that for one day in her life he is offered 500 dollars. Finally it turns out that the customer confused the apartment and the right woman lives next door. She turns out to be an attractive blonde, who is often visited by a lover, a young businessman who is also an aspiring politician.
Having switched to the new target, Zimin, however, is not in a hurry to part with his former ward.
