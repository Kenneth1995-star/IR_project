Nick Simple Diamond is more like the brains than his detective brother Herbert Simple, aka Tim Diamond, inc. Because when a dwarf enters with a secret package, nearly all the crooks in England are out to get Tim and Nick, and just because of a confectionary package. Nick and Tim soon break their promise to the dwarf, and open the secret package. Soon they find out that the secret package actually is a box of malteasers. Belonging to an international criminal named Henry von Falkenberg, or The Falcon, a secret opening a very precious treasure belonging to the dead criminal.
Later, the dwarf is found dead, and Tim is blamed for it. Nick spends time in jail with him, and they join old chief Inspectors Snape and Boyle. Soon they are threatened by criminals, sent to jail, wanted for murder, wanted for disturbance, nearly killed, kidnapped, given concrete trainers, bullied by punk criminals and invited by women who keep crocodiles for pets. If all these criminals are after a small box of chocolates, this must mean that it is a serious mystery the two have to solve, and this should be a case for Tim Diamond, but is it just him, or his is it his kid brother's help with succession, and together will the Diamond Brothers solve a crime that is tougher than thought?
