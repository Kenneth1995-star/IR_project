First a Girl

Shop girl Elizabeth (Jessie Matthews) is delivering costumes to a theatre where popular female impersonator Victor (Sonnie Hale), is about to open in a new show. When the star unexpectedly falls ill, Elizabeth is drafted in to take Victor's place, as a man impersonating a woman. To everyone's surprise, she and the show are both hits, and Elizabeth finds further success on a concert tour of Europe. But how long can she keep up the pretence of being a man?
