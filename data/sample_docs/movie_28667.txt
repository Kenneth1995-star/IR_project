Vimaanam

Venkidi (Prithviraj) is a school drop out because he was bullied in school for his use of 'hearing aid'. He becomes interested in aeronautics as he is introduced to the story of Wright brothers in school. As he grows up, he falls in love with Janaki (Durga Krishna), his best friend and inspiration for his dreams. Finally Venkidi succeeds in his goal to make an aircraft by himself and flies it above his village. Everyone who used to laugh at Venkidi for his obsession with the making of aircraft are now speechless and impressed. Janaki's father finds out that Venkidi stole his car for finding a suitable engine for his aircraft and gets him arrested. In the meantime Janaki is forcefully sent to Singapore to her relatives for higher studies with the understanding that she will be married off to their son Ananthan (Saiju Kurup). The story ends as old Venkidi, now a Padma award winner for his achievements, meets the widowed Janaki and her daughter who have come to India to meet him. They fulfill their dream to fly together in Venkidi's old aircraft he made years ago in his village[2].
