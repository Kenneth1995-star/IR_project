Happy Ghost III

The spirit of the late female singer Tsui Pan Han (Maggie Cheung) waits in the afterlife for a chance to be reincarnated. She meets the Godfather (Tsui Hark) who has found an appropriate musical family for her to be reincarnated with. Her opportunity to be born into the new family is ruined when Sam Kwai (Raymond Wong) takes the pregnant wife to the wrong hospital. Pan Han is given one month to find a new body to assume her reincarnation in, and decides in the meantime to harass Sam Kwai. One time, the head prefect Tai Cheuk-yee (Fennie Yuen) is possessed by Tsui to stir up a row in a sex club, causing a bunch of gangsters to be imprisoned. Kwai eventually summons Happy Ghost to help him out.
