DD (Sumanth) Chinna (trinetrudu) are two close friends who are brought up in an orphanage. They are very fond of Saraswatamma (Sudha) who took care of them there. Saraswatamma was very good at preparing tamarind rice (pulihora). DD wishes to start a pulihora center in memory of Saraswatamma when he grows up. In order to earn the money to do so, he joins a mafia gang doing small odd jobs. Pragati (Kriti Kharbanda) is the daughter of a millionaire politician. She is kind hearted and works for an NGO. She comes to know that a certain landlord has cheated the people of the village that her NGO works for. The court, out of no choice, tells the farmers that they need to pay 40 million to the landlord if they wish to regain their land. Pragati asks her father to help out the villagers and he says, yes. Later when she finds out that her father has actually lied to her, she argues with him and leaves his house. Pragati's friend sketches a self-kidnap plan in order to demand 40 million as ransom from her father. Things go awry when DD and Chinna accidentally kidnap Pragathi at the same time as she's supposed to be kidnapped by someone else. The rest of the story is all about how DD and Pragati realise their goals while falling in love with each other.
