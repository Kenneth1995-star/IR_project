Mudhal Thethi

Sivagnanam (Sivaji Ganesan) works as a bank clerk. Though his pay is meagre, he deals with a lot of cash at the bank. His family consists of wife Lakshmi (Anjali Devi), a daughter whose marriage is being negotiated and two school going children. The bank where he works crashes. Sivagnanam is unable to find another job.
Dejected, he tries to kill himself so that his insurance money would be made available to the family. His soul reaches the court of Yama, the god of death. Angered by what he deals an irresponsible act, Yama sends him back to earth to see the result of his death. He is able to observe the goings on but is unable to participate. He watches his son being picked up by the police for stealing food, his daughter is molested and his wife drowns herself in a well after murdering the rapist. He realizes his mistake. Thankfully the whole series of events has been a dream.[4]
