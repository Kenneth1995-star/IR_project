Darby and Joan

Mrs. Gorry and her son lived by an old mill stream. The landlord decided to utilise the water of the mill stream for an artificial lake, bringing poverty to the Gorry's house. Mrs. Gorry and her son Patrick were left nearly destitute, and in her heart there grew a great bitterness. One night she made her son kneel down and swear vengeance on Sayle Moore. Moore had a daughter of whom he was fond. Patrick Gorry and Sheila Moore fell in love. Their parents would not agree to the marriage, but the young couple married without consent. From then on the struggle to live against overwhelming odds was terrible. Patrick was arrested and charged with murder, but was quickly acquitted. Struggling as a lawyer he finally won out, and fickle fortune smiled on him. Moore came to see Patrick, and wanted to adopt his little son, but the parents would not consent. Later the little boy was accidentally killed by his grandfather's carriage. The years passed on and Patrick was made a Judge. As a Judge he had to try the case of the man who in his early years had victimised the Gorry family.[2]
