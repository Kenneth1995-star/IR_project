Love Khichdi

Vir is a bachelor from a small town working as a sous-chef in a five-star hotel in Mumbai, India. He is a handsome, charming, macho, idiot who flirts with, yearns for and lusts after any woman who is friendly, but seems unattainable. From his man-hating maid, whom he ogles as she wipes his floor, to the man-eating owner of a call centre who could wipe the floor with him, to the too-tall model, and the too-young pest down the corridor...from the Bengali-Beauty-with-Brains-and-Books to the married-flirt next door - Vir is suckered by them all.
With his ego, confusion and commitment ... it is so difficult to stop flattering and lying, to himself. The sometimes smart and sometimes silly observations of his all-male gang of cooks at the hotel kitchen is of little help until Vir is finally forced to grow up.
