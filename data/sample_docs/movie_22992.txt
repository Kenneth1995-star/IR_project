Her Vengeance

At a Macao nightclub employee Ying (Pauline Wong) inadvertently angers a group of drunken men who follow Wong after her shift has ended and proceed to rape her. After her traumatic ordeal, her blind sister (Elaine Kam) encourages her to seek revenge leading her to ask former-triad Hung (Lam Ching-ying) for help. Hung who is wheelchair-bound gives her a job at his lounge as a waiter and helps her find somewhere new to live but refuses to help her take revenge. A chance encounter with one of her attackers (Shing Fui-On) gives her the opportunity she was waiting for as she begins to hunt them down one by one.[3]
