Entrepreneur C. K. Oberoi, who is known for his philandering ways is in love with a judge's daughter and wants to remarry after a failed marriage with his first wife, now old. (Amrish Puri) raises a child as his own as it was his love child, and the child Vijay Kumar (Ajay Devgn) grows to live up to his expectations, but soon has to face the ire of the envious and power hungry relatives of Oberoi, who do not want Vijay to prosper, little knowing that he is in fact a long lost relative or love child of Mr C.K, Oberoi. This film was never a hit.
