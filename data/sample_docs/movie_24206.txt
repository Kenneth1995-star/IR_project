Rajrani Meera

Meera (Durga Khote), is immersed in her love and devotion to Lord Krishna since a young age. When she grows older her family get her married to the Rana of Mewar Prithviraj Kapoor. Misunderstandings occur when her devotional poetry is thought to be love songs for someone. Several hardships are inflicted on her by her husband and her in-laws. She takes to sitting in the temple and singing bhajans (sacred songs) composed by her. Her brother-in-law tries to have her killed many times but fails. She finally renounces her life in the palace and wanders from place to place singing devotional songs.
