Aparoopa

In the colonial upper class society of Assam, a young woman has to give up pursuit of her university education for an arranged marriage with a rich tea-planter. The plantation and its social routine become a prison of boredom for her since her husband completely neglects her for his business. She is outraged when she discovers that her marriage takes place in order to eliminate her father's huge debt. She considers herself as having been sold to her husband. Then one day an old classmate and ex-lover, now an army officer, visits them. Depressed, she is drawn to him as she seeks fulfillment.[1][2][3]
