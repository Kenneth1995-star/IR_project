The Girl on a Motorcycle

Newly married Rebecca leaves her husband's Alsatian bed on her prized motorbike—her symbol of freedom and escape—to visit Daniel, her lover in Heidelberg. En route, she indulges in psychedelic and erotic reveries as she relives her changing relationship with the two men, before crashing into a truck at the end.
