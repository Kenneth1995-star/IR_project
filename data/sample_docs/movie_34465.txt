Girlfriends

29-year-old Song-yi (Kang Hye-jung) starts dating her handsome co-worker Jin-ho (Bae Soo-bin). But when she suspects Jin-ho might be cheating on her, she sets out to meet the "other woman," only to learn that he has not one, but two, other "girlfriends": Jin (Han Chae-young), Jin-ho's first love, is a sexy and successful party planner, while Bo-ra (Huh E-jae) is a fearless, young college student. On one hand, Song-yi wants to keep Jin-ho all to herself, but strangely enough, she grows close to the two other women and their similar taste in men becomes the basis of a great friendship and a passionate, incestuous love affair.[5]
