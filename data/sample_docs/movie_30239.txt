Ganga Gowri

Shiva (Arun Vijay) and his brother Vichu (Vadivelu) are carefree youth while their father Pandiyan (Dindigul I. Leoni) is a miser. Shiva falls in love with Ganga (Mantra) at first sight and tries to seduce her with his brother's help. Ultimately, Ganga also falls in love with him. Gowri (Sangita) comes from her village and begins to work in Pandiyan's house as a maid.
Few months ago, Shiva was bitten by a snake and Muthu (Siva) saved him. Muthu cannot marry Gowri because of their horoscope. According to tradition, Gowri must get married with another man for one week and then she can marry Muthu. Shiva, grateful to Muthu for saving his life, got married with her and left the village. Thereafter, Gowri didn't want to marry Muthu anymore, Muthu was understandable and he advised her to rejoin Shiva.
Finally, Pandiyan accepts Shiva and Ganga's marriage. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
