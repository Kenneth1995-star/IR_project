Malpe is a small fishing town on the Arabian Coast, located 6Â km to the west of the temple city, Udupi. Malpe's beaches are washed clean everyday by the sea. The waves ensure that nothing gets left behind on the sands. But the waves cannot reach everything....
It is the time of the year when Udupi and its surroundings are decked up to celebrate Sri Krishna Janmashtami. Men and children walk the streets dressed as characters from mythology. Teams painted as tigers are seen dancing to drum beats all around the town. But violence seems to be brewing in Malpe this Krishna Janmashtami. The movie revolves around five different people narrating their view of a murder incidence that took place during Sri Krishna Janmashtami.
