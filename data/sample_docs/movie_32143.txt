Thotti Gang

Achi Babu (Allari Naresh), Sathi Babu (Sunil) and Suri Babu (Prabhu Deva) are three best buddies since childhood. They form a band that does multi purpose jobs like acting as band of boys for marriages, professional catchers of dogs, and cremation service guys. Karate Malliswari (Gajala), another childhood nightmarish karate-skill-flaunting damsel, lures Achi Babu into love. Then she snatches Achi Babu away from Suri Babu and Sathi Babu to make him her live-in boy friend. They also get engaged to each other. Irritated by their act, Suri Babu and Sathi Babu kidnap Malliswari. They tie her to a chair and then hatch another plan to make Achi Babu believe that Malliswari is dead. In that process, they dig a 'fresh' dead body from a crematorium, pack her in the car of Malliswari and throw that car into a valley. Police confirms that Malliswari is dead and Achi Babu's heart breaks again. Then appears Venkata Lakshmi (Anita Hassanandani), the childhood sweetheart of Achi Babu. Venkata Lakshmi has another flashback . As she was staying in her elder sisters house, her husband becomes attracted to her and one night when she was asleep,he comes to her bedroom and makes love with her. When she wakes up, she is shocked to see her nightdress open and she runs off the room. Her elder sister doesn't help her and she was in a hurry to join an Ashram run by Matasri (Shakeela). Sathi Babu and Suri Babu hatch another plan to unite this couple. At this moment, Malliswari escapes from the den. The rest of the story is all about how these poor confused souls join together and the happy ending.
