Krishna Lanka is an island village in Godavari districts. The only way of commuting to that island is by navigation. Lots of people die due to bad weather conditions while they travel. Krishna Lanka's rich and honest village President Bullabbai (Vijay Kumar) wants to have a bridge to that island which costs several crores. He asks his IAS friend Venkata Ratnam (Prakash Raj) to make his dream come true. Even 20 years after Venkata Ratnam leaving the village, there is no news about the bridge. Bullebbai sends his son Chandu (Ravi Teja) to Hyderabad to meet Venkata Ratnam and learn the progress. After coming to Hyderabad, Chandu realizes that Venkata Ratnam is very money-minded and is least bothered about the bridge. The rest of the story is all about how Chandu makes Venkata Ratnam get the bridge approved by the government.
