Wo Hu

Superintendent Wai (Michael Miu) organises an operation, code named WO HU, where he sends an army of undercover cops to spy on triad leader Jim (Eric Tsang). Jim discovers one of the undercover cops, Eric (Timmy Hung), and sends low level triad member, Killer (Shawn Yue), to assassinate him. Killer carries the hit but failed to flee Hong Kong afterwards. Then, Jim orders other triad leaders, Walter (Francis Ng) and Tommy (Julian Cheung), to keep it low in order to avoid the cops' attention. Tommy believes that his triad brothers are plotting to take his assets. After Tommy was exposed by an undercover cop in his crew, he must flee Hong Kong and leave his businesses to Jim. Tommy, however, does not trust Jim and plots against him.
