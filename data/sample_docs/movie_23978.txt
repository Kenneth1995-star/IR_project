Kranti

Jeet (Jeet) is a student whose family, consisting of his parents and elder sister Devashree (Locket Chatterjee), migrated to the city. Since their arrival, they have to struggle amongst the crowd to exist. People of the city fear Vishnu (Ashish Vidyarthi), the local don. His younger brother Deva (Rishi Kaushik) studies in the same college as that of Jeet. Deva's gang in the college are the biggest troublemakers, who tease girls and pass bad comments at them. Jeet, who tries to handle the situation, clashes with Deva's gang for a number of times and beats his gang members. In retaliation, Vishnu's goons start attacking his family members and friends. One day they spot Devashree on the road and assaults her. They rape her one by one in public. They also kill his intimate college friend Iqbal (Biswanath Basu) and finally kill his father (Bodhisatwa Majumdar). A helpless and heartbroken Jeet is left with nothing, but only a strong desire to punish the wrongdoers. He becomes determined to kill Vishnu. In the end, Jeet is successful in killing Deva and Vishnu, thus fulfilling his revenge.
