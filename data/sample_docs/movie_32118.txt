Subbu

Bala Subramanyam alias Subbu (Jr. NTR) is a college student who is loved by each and everyone for his cool nature and lovable philosophy of keeping his head cool all the time. Neeraja (Sonali Joshi) is a Good Samaritan who keeps on donating money anonymously to fund 25 seats in the college in which Subbu is studying. Subbu is curious to know about the person who is donating that money.
Subbu falls in love with Neeraja, mainly for her positive attitude. There is a strong reason for Neeraja to donate money to the college. There is a stronger reason for Subbu to become a cool-headed guy.
In the flashback, Subbu rescues a girl who met with an accident and admits her in a hospital. She is a daughter of a rich industrialist GK Chowdary. GK Chowdary misunderstands Subbu as the other Bala Subramanyam who is responsible for his daughter to become pregnant. Without knowing truth, GK becomes a reason for the suicides of Subbu's entire family. GK realizes the truth later. And incidentally Neeraja is the younger sister of the girl whom Subbu rescues.
By the time of interval the audience realize that Subbu and Neeraja are in search of each other. Rest of the film twirls around how this couple realizes that they are made for each other, in deed.
