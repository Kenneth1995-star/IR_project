Louis Pothen is a television film critic, an artist, a divorce lawyer and also participates in a live TV channel named "Kathrika". His wife Vasuki Iyer is a Kathakali artist and they live together along with their school going daughter. They live away from their parents since their marriage was an inter-caste one.
Vasuki is raped by her two neighbors and their cloth presser. Vasuki is frightened to discuss with her husband about her being raped. Vasuki with DCP Jeena Bhai's telephonic assistance kills her rapists. Vasuki assures DCP that she would never have any contacts with her in the future and if they meet accidentally, would behave like strangers.
It is revealed that Louis was informed by Swami of his wife being raped. Swami had witnessed Vasuki being raped from his house but did not have the courage to save Vasuki since the rapists were notorious and drug addicts. Louis through a mobile software (which can transform a male voice to a female voice) mimicked DCP Jeena Bhai and guided Vasuki to murder her rapists . Louis never reveals the truth to Vasuki and decides to keep it as a secret so that they could lead a happy married life.
