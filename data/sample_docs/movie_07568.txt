13 West Street

For no discernible reason, scientist Walt Sherill is assaulted and viciously beaten by a group of well-dressed young men. When the police, including investigating officer Detective Koleski, are in his opinion too slow in finding the culprits, Sherill decides to go after them on his own.
A private investigator's work leads him to Chuck Landry, the gang's leader. Sherill's non-stop search for revenge causes one member of the gang to commit suicide. Landry counters by kidnapping Sherill's wife, Tracey, and the private eye is killed.
Sherill goes directly to the boy's home and beats him savagely. On the verge of killing him, Sherill finally relents, turning Landry over to Koleski to be placed under arrest.
