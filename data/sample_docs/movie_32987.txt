Michio Yamada (Daijiro Harada), a recent school graduate, is sent to Tokyo to work as a fruit-packer in a department store as part of a government programme. He takes a gun from a house on an American base and uses it to kill several people.
The scene changes to Yamada's childhood. Yamada is born the child of a reprobate and a weak-willed woman (Nobuko Otowa). As a boy Yamada experiences poverty and the rape of his sister at first hand.
