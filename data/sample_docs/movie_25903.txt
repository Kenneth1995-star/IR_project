Kaalia

Kaalia is an action flick from the Mithun-T. L. V. Prasad team. The film has the usual story line of revenge and the fight against injustice. Kalicharan lives a middle-class life with his unmarried sister. Since Kalicharan is an honest man, he refuses to pay or accept bribes, which brings him into the bad books of gangster Bhawani Singh. When Kalicharan refuses to budge, Singh gets Kalicharan arrested on false charges and he is sent to prison. In prison, a new Kalicharan is born — who calls himself Kaalia — and whose main motive is the destruction of Bhawani Singh.
