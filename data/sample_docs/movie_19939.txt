Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter

Herman inherits a prize greyhound called Mrs. Brown and aims to race the dog and win the derby. Herman and his group, The Hermits, play gigs to raise money for the race entry fees. The Hermits travel from Manchester to London for more concerts, and at the London dog race, Herman falls for Judy, who is also Mrs. Brown's daughter.
