Goodbye Love

Chester Hamilton (Sidney Blackmer) is sent to "alimony jail" for non-payment of alimony to Sandra (Mayo Methot). Hamilton's valet, Oswald Groggs (Charles Ruggles), uses his bossâ€™s reservations at an exclusive resort to go on vacation under the assumed identity of wealthy eccentric "Sir Oswald". Phyllis Van Kamp (Verree Teasdale) tries to marry "Sir Oswald" for his money. When Oswald seems to fall for her, the question is who will be left standing at the altar. Chester's trusted secretary (Phyllis Barry) and a reporter (Ray Walker) witness all these shenanigans.
