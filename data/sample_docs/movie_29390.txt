Valiba Virundhu

An unemployed youth (Ravichandran) and a vivacious girl (Bharati) are neighbours who fight frequently on trivial matters. Bharathi's wealthy father (Balaiah) wants to donate some of his properties for charity. This is objected to by his nephew (Asokan) who intends to marry Bharati and seize all the properties. When Balaiah threatens to expel Asokan, the latter abducts Balaiah and replaces him with a doppelgänger. With the help of the doppelgänger, Asokan tries to marry Bharati, who is oblivious to the fact that her father has been abducted. However, Ravichandran successfully exposes Asokan, rescues the real Balaiah and marries Bharati.
