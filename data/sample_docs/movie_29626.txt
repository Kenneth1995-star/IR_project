Ram Lakshman

Ram (Kamal Haasan) and his pet elephant Laxman have grown up together and are very emotionally attached to one another. They share such a strong bond that Ram refuses to marry his sweetheart Meena (Sripriya) when her father refuses to sanction their marriage unless Ram leaves Laxman. Meanwhile, in a very cunningly planned plot, an employee of Meena's father kills him and implicates Ram and Laxman for the murder. How the two friends stand by each other in the hour of need and how they prove themselves innocent forms the rest of the plot.
