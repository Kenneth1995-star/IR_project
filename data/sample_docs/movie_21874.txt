Palais Royale

This dark crime comedy is set in 1959 where Gerald Price (Matt Craven) is a newcomer to Toronto. He competes with mobster Tony Dicarlo (Kim Coates) for the affections of Odessa Muldoon (Kim Cattrall). Meanwhile, Michael Dattalico (Dean Stockwell) is eager to expand his organized crime business in Toronto.[2][3] Much of the action takes place in the art deco dance hall of the title, a historic building set on the shores of Lake Ontario.
The film does feature a nice turn by Cattrall channeling Marilyn Monroe as a gangsterâ€™s moll before her departure to the U.S. and fame in Sex and the City.
