Thamizhachi

A reporter (Revathi) comes to a village in search of interesting village true stories. She comes to know that a woman called Thamizhselvi (Ranjitha) has not left her house for seven years. Thamizhselvi tells to the reporter her sad past.
In the past, Rasayya (Napoleon) was a short-tempered man and the son of the village chief Periyasamy Gounder (Vijayakumar) while Undrayer Gounder (Mohan Natarajan) was a heartless rich villager. Both often clashed and fought. Some contrived situations made the villagers believed that the innocent Rasayya was a womaniser. Later, Rasayya fell in love with Thamizhselvi who was from the nearby village and they got married. Thamizhselvi thought that Rasayya was also a womaniser, so Rasayya proved her the contrary. One day, Undrayer Gounder tried to rape Thamizhselvi but she killed him. Rasayya surrendered for the murder and he was sentenced to the capital punishment.
The reporter promises to save Rasayya from the capital punishment. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
