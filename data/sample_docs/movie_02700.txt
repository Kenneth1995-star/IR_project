Trouble in Sundown

A banker named Cameron is suspected of a robbery because he was the only person who knew the vault lock's combination. When a corrupt land owner, Ross Daggett, tries to exact vigilante justice, rancher Clint Bradford goes to the aid of June Cameron, the banker's daughter, and hides her father.
June inadvertently leads Daggett and his men, including hired gun Dusty, to her father's hiding place, where Cameron is captured and taken back to town. Dusty is tricked by Clint into revealing a secret panel through which Daggett was able to view Cameron's use of the vault combination. June is grateful to Clint when her father goes free.
