Thamizh

Thamizh (Prashanth) leads a happy life with his mother (Manorama) and sister-in-law Kalaichelvi (Urvasi). His brother (Livingston) is working in Kuwait, and Thamizh too dreams of joining him there. Meenakshi (Simran), their tenant, and Thamizh fall in love. When the goons of Periyavar (Ashish Vidyarthi) injure Thamizh's niece, he stops Periyavar's car on the road and questions him. He then beats up one of Periyavar's goons when insulted. This makes him Periyavar's target, and though he tries to withdraw from the violence, he is forced to join forces with Rathnam (Nassar), Periyavar's sworn enemy, and eventually defeats him.
