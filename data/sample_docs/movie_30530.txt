Parasuram

An underground terror group led by a mysterious proxy Akash recruits unemployed youth and turns them into suicide bombers. Asst. Commissioner of Police Parashuram (Arjun) decides to take the case (and the film) into his own hands in a fit of patriotic fervour. In a subsequent fit of wisdom, he hides a key witness (gayathri raghuram ) at the home of his flaky fiancee (Kiran), thereby endangering both and his anti-terror mission in general.
