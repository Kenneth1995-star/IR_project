Veeraiah (Mikkilineni) is hard working, honest, and a sincere laborer. When his wife collapses during delivery, perturbed Veeraiah runs for a doctor. At the same time, police chase a thief in another street. The thief hits Veeraiah, keeps the stolen ornament in his pocket and runs away. Police arrest Veeraiah and present him in court. Public prosecutor Ranganatham (Gummadi) argus that he is the culprit because he was son and grandson of thieves, so, he is also a thief. Desperate Veeraiah escapes from jail to see the wife. By the time he reaches hospital his wife dies giving birth a male child. At the same time, Ranganatham's wife (Hemalatha) also delivers a male child. When Veeraiah knows this, plots a churn in his mind and he exchanges the children. After that Veeraiah is again caught by Police and sentenced to jail. He gives the child to his neighbor Suramma (P. Lakshmikantamma) to the rear. Due to hunger and no parental care, the boy becomes a thief.
Years roll by, Judge Ranganatham's son Venu (N. T. Rama Rao) becomes a notorious criminal and the laborer Veeraiah's son Vasu (Jaggayya) becomes a reputed lawyer.
