Hahakaar

Police Inspector Saeed Rehman Alok Nath is an honest police officer. As he continued to work without accepting any bribes, he became a liability to some of his colleagues, including Inspector N. A. Pradhan Shafi Inamdar, who frames him for a crime Saeed did not commit and has him dismissed from the police force. Saeed vows to avenge this humiliation, and enlists the help of Rakesh Akshay Anand, who in turn enlists the aid of his beloved, Anita Chandni. During the course of trying to expose Inspector Pradhan, they come across the real kingpin behind Pradhan, namely the notorious Raunakbhai Paresh Rawal. And nothing comes in the way of Raunakbhai, as Saeed, Rakesh, and Anita will soon find out, as he has incriminating evidence against the Chief Minister of the State, as well as other dignitaries which leads to the climax of the film.
