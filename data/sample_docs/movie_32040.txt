Choodalani Vundi

Ramakrishna (Chiranjeevi)26 is a mechanic whose life changes when he meets Priya (Anjala Zaveri)18 at a train station. She sees him and feels some inexplicable connection, and runs away with him to flee her father, Mahendra's (Prakash Raj)41 goons. They end up living in the forest with their son 7 , but Mahendra, who is an underworld don, kidnaps her so that he can marry her off to another don's son. Ramakrishna confronts her father and in the ensuing struggle, Priya takes the bullet shot at her husband and dies. Their son, because of the shock, loses his voice, and Ramakrishna is jailed. Mahendra takes the boy away to Kolkata, where the story originally started. Ramakrishna, with the help of Padmavathi (Soundarya)22, reunites with his son.
