Thirumathi Palanisamy

Palanisamy (Sathyaraj) is an uneducated man who dreams to marry a teacher and lives with his friend Dhandapani (Goundamani). Palanisamy falls in love with Hamsaveni (Sukanya) at first sight. He decides to go to her village Irugur. First reluctant, she finally agrees to marry him, but only under three conditions : to continue to work as a teacher, to live in her hometown and with her father. After the marriage, Palanisamy imposes her three conditions : she must leave her hometown, be a teacher in the city that he has chosen and leave her father. She accepts them and Palanisamy explains the reason of these conditions.
In the past, Palanisamy lived in a village where a don Aandhavar (Kripa Shanker) forced the children to work in his fireworks factory. Palanisamy's father was a doctor and tried to save the children, knowing it, Aandhavar killed him. Aandhavar also killed his sister for the only reason that she was educated. Palanisamy asked many teachers to come to his village but everyone refused for fear of Aandhavar.
Palanisamy's only hope is now Hamsaveni. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
