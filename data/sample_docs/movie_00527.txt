Confessions of a Queen

The King of Illyris (Lewis Stone) marries a neighboring princess (Alice Terry), who finds out he has a mistress, Sephora (Helena D'Algy). Revolted, she turns to Prince Alexei (John Bowers) for friendship. Turmoil increases as a revolution demands the abdication of the King and the Queen opposes this decision.
