Sadhu Aur Shaitaan

Innocent and honest Bajrang (Mehmood) drives a taxi and helps everyone. He is devoted to another kind-hearted gentleman Mr. Sadhuram (Om Prakash) who is a bank employee. Bajrang is attracted to a school-teacher, Vidya (Bharathi). Vidya's brother Dina Nath (Kishore Kumar) is a Drama Artist. One day a man claiming to be a childhood friend of Sadhuram, named Sher Khan (Pran), enters their lives. His motive is to rob the bank where Sadhuram is employed and blame Sadhuram for this. He manipulates Sadhuram into accepting him, and moves in with him. He borrows a large sum of money from Sadhuram, and also manages to duplicate the bank's safe's key, and steals the money. The Bank Manager (Nasir Hussain) notifies the police of the robbery and Sadhuram becomes the prime suspect. In panic Sadhuram, who comes into possession of the money that Sher Khan has stolen, flees with the police on his tail. Sher Khan (alias dacoit Dilawar Khan) is killed and his dead body ends up in the back seat of Bajrang's taxi, and Bajrang too is on the run. No one can clear them of the crime because Dilawar Khan is dead.
