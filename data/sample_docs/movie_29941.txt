Thanga Manasukkaran

Murugesh (Murali) also known as Murugan, a musician, comes with his troupe in a village. The village belle Chellakili (Sivaranjani) waits for her lover Murugan who was missing while her cousin Duraipandi (G. M. Sundar), a brute, wants to marry her. Murugesh finally reveals that he is her long lost lover Murugan and also discloses the reason behind his missing.
In the past, Chellakili's father (Vijayakumar) wanted to marry his daughter with the family friend and orphan Murugan. Whereas Yasodai (C. R. Saraswathi), Chellakili's aunt, wanted to marry Chellakili with Duraipandi. She managed to beat Murugan and she expelled him from the village. Later, Murugan became a singer in a music band but he cannot forget Chellakili.
Duraipandi and Yasodai are now aware of Murugan's return. They then reveal Chellakili's love affair to her father without disclosing Murugesh's real identity. Her family then meet the Sadha Swamy who causes Chellakili to forget her love. Now, Chellakili rejects Murugan's love. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
