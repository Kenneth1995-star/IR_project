But Sandhya is unaware of this fact. Sri Kumar (Venu Thottempudi), who is a brother-in-law of Surya Prakash, is a Casanova. He falls in love with Sandhya at the very first sight. Satya Bhama (Sangeetha) is also an inmate in the Girls Hostel. She falls in love with Surya Prakash. Later it is revealed that Satya Bhama is a younger sister of Bhavani.
