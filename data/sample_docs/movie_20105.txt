Virgin Witch

Christine (Ann Michelle) and her sister Betty (Vicki Michelle) are aspiring models. When agent Sybil Waite (Patricia Haines) offers Christine a weekend's work shooting an advert at a house in the country, Christine takes Betty with her to frustrate Johnny (Keith Buckley), an older man who is attracted to Betty.
The modelling job is actually a ploy to initiate Christine into a coven of white wizards of which the owner of the house, Gerald Amberley (Neil Hallett), is leader and Sybil high priestess. Christine, who has psychic abilities, joins of her own free will, believing that magic can be used for good as well as evil. Christine's powers create tension between her and Sybil, who is a lesbian and has an obvious sexual interest in her. The conflict escalates when Sybil vows to have Betty initiated into the coven.
At the initiation ritual, Christine wrests control from Sybil by psychically torturing her. Betty is rescued by Johnny, who has been alerted to Sybil's predatory nature by a friend. Christine then uses her powers to kill Sybil and take her place as high priestess.
