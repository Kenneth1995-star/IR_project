Uchathula Shiva

An easy-going taxi driver, Shiva (Karan) gives out advice on hygiene and the need to be 'professional' to an idli vendor on street, thus establishing himself as someone with a humanitarian side, in the very first scene. Further, his conversation with Gnanasambandam (who plays himself) in a car and the way he talks to his over-concerned mother over phone (Kovai Sarala's voice) brings him closer to the audience. However, within no time, things go haywire when the story actually kicks off.
Nila (Neha) is being chased by a prominent drug dealer (Naren) in the town, and Shiva comes to her rescue and offers a lift. He tries to contact people who are close to her to ensure safety. Little does he know that he is inviting trouble, as things start going beyond his control. What follows is an unexpected series of incidents.
