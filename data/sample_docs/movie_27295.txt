His college friend Seetharam(Raju Ananthaswamy) from Karnataka, teaches him Kannada to talk with Varalakshmi. When Shankar returns to Delhi, his mother plans to marry him off and he reluctantly agrees to meet his bride-to-be. In the party, During the conversation he realizes the letter "B" in his name is for "Bangaadi". But he doesn't know whether Bangaadi is a person or a town, and is curious about its significance. When Shankar is speaking in Kannada with his brother over the phone for fun, his father hears it. And his father says, "Speak in Kannada, my son. It has been so long since I have heard that language". Then, Shankar discovers he is a Kannadiga and is happy that he's at least found his Origin. His father confesses that his father (Shankar's Grandfather) abandoned his native but he didn't try to go back even once. Shankar wants to discover his native.
So, Shankar visits Seethram's Home. There he realizes that Bangaadi is a small village near Seethram's home. Then, he plans to visit Bangaadi. There, Shankar meets his grand-aunt, an old, frail woman who is delighted to see her brother (Shankar's Grandfather) reincarnated before her eyes.

He had a young, cheerful daughter Srimathi(Rekha Unnikrishnan), who teaches Kannada to the small kids around. Shankar seriously thinks about his grand-aunt's words.
Shankar returns to his home in Delhi with the news for his father, wanting to return to Bangaadi with his entire family (including Varalakshmi). However, none of them want to go with him. Varalakshmi, who is practising medicine refuses to come with him as her Career was important to her.
When Shankar comes to Bangaadi, he initially faces many problems from Shanbhog. But, somehow he successfully builds a bridge across the river, sets up a micro hydro electric Project to generate Electricity which can be used for Fencing. He also starts to cultivate his land. He gets all help for his works from Muttaiah (Krishnegowda). The love and respect Shankar got from the village people in a short span of time makes Shanbhog furious and envious on Shankar. Meanwhile, Srimathi loves him and dreams of a life with him.
Varalakshmi once arrives to Bangaadi, wishing to be him. But Srimathi meets her and begs her to sacrifice her love for Srimathi. Varalakshmi does so and returns to Delhi with a broken heart.
Shankar's hard work gain him reward and all the village people set off for a Celebration for the crops harvesting time. During this, Shankar's Grandmother falls ill and breathes her last.

Shankar tries to take her to the City. But Shanbhog, in anger destroys the bridge. So, Srimathi breathes her last due to lack of Medical Treatment.
Finally, Shankar loses all hopes in his life and he is all set to leave Bangaadi to return to Delhi.
