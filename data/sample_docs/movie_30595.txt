Arjun, Reemma Sen, Divya Spandana, Devayani

Two villages on either side of a river are always feuding as the headmen Veerasamy (Vinu Chakravarthy) and Sethupathy (Fefsi Vijayan) have personal enmity. Due to some misunderstanding, Sethupathy’s children die and the blame falls on Veerasamy. Sethupathy seeks revenge and tries to kill Veerasamy’s son but is saved by his servant's son but the boy disappears.
20 years later Shiva (Arjun) is seen arriving in Kumbakonam living with a bakery owner Veerabagu (Vadivelu). Shiva’s mission is to protect Devayani and her son from all sorts of gangsters. Priya (Reema Sen) walks into the bakery. Though she dislikes and torments Veerabhagu, she falls for Shiva. Sooner, the true identity of Shiva is revealed as he saves Devayani and her son from being murdered by Sethupathy’s son.
When questioned about his identity it is revealed in flashback that Shiva is Giri, the hatchet man of Veerasamy. Devayani’s husband DSP Chandrashekhar is actually Suryaprakash (Prakash Raj) ,the long lost son of Veerasamy and he was killed by Sethupathy. To protect the rest of the family, Giri was sent to bring them back to the village. In the village Giri has another love interest, Devaki (Ramya) the niece of Sethupathy.
All this leads to a bloody climax during a boat race and Sethupathy and his family are wiped out by Giri. And the film ends with both the girls cling on to Giri.
