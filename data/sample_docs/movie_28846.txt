Jatt & Juliet 2

Fateh Singh (Diljit Dosanjh) is a Punjab police constable who desperately wants a promotion. Due to this, he accepts the request of his Deputy Commissioner request backed up by Inspector Singh's (Jaswinder Bhalla) to fly to Canada and convince her daughter, Pooja Singh (Neeru Bajwa), and her mother to come back to India. Fateh assumes that it should be a fairly task. He flies to Canada and upon reaching Vancouver, starts his mission to bring Pooja back but mistakes Pooja's friend working in a beauty salon as Pooja herself, but is dismayed when he finds out that Pooja is actually a "by the books" police officer with the Vancouver Police Department. Fateh, in order to bring her back and to avoid deputation back to India, helps Pooja to convince her mother in getting herself roped with a Caucasian guy in a marriage bond whom Pooja likes. This clashes with his irreverent and unsophisticated personality, but soon the two begin to find themselves drawn to one another.
