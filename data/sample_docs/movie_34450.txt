Closer to Heaven

Lee Ji-soo is a twice-divorced funeral director, and no stranger to death or loss. She reunites with old friend Baek Jong-woo when he arranges for funeral services for his deceased mother. Jong-woo has been battling Lou Gehrig's disease since he was a teenager. The two fall in love and get married. As Jong-woo's symptoms continue to worsen and he begins to lose control over his body, he lashes out at Ji-soo. Despite her hurt, all Ji-soo wants is to stay by his side and hope for a cure.
