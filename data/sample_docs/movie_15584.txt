The Answer Man

Everyone wants to meet Arlen Faber (Jeff Daniels), the world-famous author of the best-selling spiritual book Me and God, but crotchety, disgruntled Arlen simply wants to be left alone, and so far he's been successful at keeping his identity a secret. But all that changes when troubled bookstore owner Kris Lucas (Lou Taylor Pucci) discovers his home address and barters books for Arlen's words of wisdom, and a back injury leads the reclusive writer to date chiropractor and overprotective single mother Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). As Arlen's relationships with his newfound friends grow, he must come to terms with his past and the realization that he doesn't hold all the answers.
