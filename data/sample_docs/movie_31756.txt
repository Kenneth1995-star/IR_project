Soggadu

Sobhanadri (Sobhan Babu) is popularly known as 'Soggadu' in his native village. He loves his cousin Saroja (Jayasudha). Saroja's father Paramesham (Allu Ramalingaiah) does not like this as he wants Saroja to be married to a well-educated individual. Sobhanadri challenges Paramesham that he will marry an educated girl. He leaves to the town, where he meets Saroja's classmate Latha (Jayachitra). Latha has run away to escape from a forced marriage with her uncle Bhupathi (Satyanarayana). Latha and Sobhanadri get married in a hotel. Bhupathi files a case against Sobhanadri. Finally Sobhanadri and Latha reunite happily.
