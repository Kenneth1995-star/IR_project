The Plan

Se-hee is a notoriously cold-blooded money-lender. In order to survive in the cruel business, she is not afraid to seduce a man, destroy a family, or take away collateral through underhanded means. By the time her name becomes known in the business, she has two men who are always by her side: financial sponsor In-ho, and adoring regular guy Yong-hoon.
One day, Se-hee comes across Min-young, a desperate but beautiful girl who reminds her of herself when she was young. Loan sharks had ruined Se-hee's family when she was a child, which made her decide to become one herself. Se-hee lures Min-young into her clan, and together they meticulously plan an act of revenge to take down the kingpin of the loan shark business.
