Homely Meals

Homely Meals is about the journey of Alan (Vipin Atley), an odd looking youngster who is crazy about films and wants to make a mark in the visual media with aid from his rowdy friends. However, his dream is stumbled upon by his former friend Sajith (Kailash) and Sharath Chandran (Manoj K. Jayan), Sajith's mentor, who had previously helped Sajith steal credit for Alan's show.
