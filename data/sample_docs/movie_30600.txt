Ajith Kumar, Pooja

The movie begins with Jeeva (Ajith Kumar), a driving instructor, leading a happy life with his mother (Sujatha). He also fell in love with Swapna (Pooja Umashankar) after several mishaps. Sujatha hides the Jeeva truth that his father (Nizhalgal Ravi), was murdered by a dada named Manthiram (Babu Antony). The mother, much against the boy’s wish, packs off Jeeva’s twin brother, Guru (also Ajith Kumar) with a family who offer to adopt him, who had been witness to the murderer from a close quarter, to a distant town. He escapes from the family and goes to Tuticorin and grows to become a gangster there.
When Jeeva visits Tuticorin, he comes across his elder brother, Guru a.k.a. Thala. Seizing the opportunity, the elder brother kidnaps the younger one and decides to go as the driving instructor to Chennai. Initially, he plans to take revenge on his mother for packing him off from their house at a very young age. He hurts her at every step and even plans to sell off all their property.
On the other hand, Jeeva is mistaken as the gangster and is subject to attacks by the local gangsters of Tuticorin. He escapes from them and returns to Chennai to save his mother. In the meantime, Guru comes to know about his father's death and Manthiram was the cause for the same. He avenges his father's death and leaves Jeeva with his mother to live happily and goes off to jail to keep his mother in belief that he is somewhere in the world living happily.
