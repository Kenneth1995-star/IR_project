After the Banquet

In the countryside at a Catholic church, luxurious cars come rolling in. A wedding is set to take place between Ji-hong and Yoo-ri. The couple met as music club members in college. Their friends from their university days are all arriving, most of whom haven't seen each other in 10 years.
Seong-ho is now a lawyer, and married. Hyeong-woo is now a university professor who is persistently single. Kyeong-ho is now a production director (PD) at a television station. Seong-joo is now a businesswoman, and she brought along her boyfriend who is 12 years younger. Min-hee has a stable family life.
All of these friends are in their mid-thirties. During the wedding they notice that one person from their music club, Jeong-hee, is missing.
After the wedding all the friends gather together at Ji-hong and Yoo-ri's vacation house. At the evening dinner, a young girl named Mi-rae appears. She informs the group that Jeong-hee was her mother and she died in a car accident one month ago. Furthermore, she tells everyone that she came here to meet her father. Tension, shock, and surprise overtakes the friends as they recall their relationships with Jeong-hee.
