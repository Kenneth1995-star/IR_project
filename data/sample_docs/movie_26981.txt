In a flashback, all 4 self-proclaimed cowboys execute the plans to welcome their hero Sam (Aditya Seal). They then go to the station to welcome him, where Sid (Tanuj Virwani) run into Nayantara (Izabelle Leite). Then feeling sorry for themselves they begin to make their way home when they are struck by a black car. After chasing the car it is revealed that it is Sam. He apologises to Zizo and promises to fix his father's car.
They begin their fun by partying, throwing eggs at everyone's house. Sam's relationship with Sid's mom is very strong. Sam's father left him when he was six and in shock of it, his mother became an alcoholic and remarried.
After a few days, Sid runs into Nayantara in a music store; he begins to fall for her. Sam meets and falls for Nayantara in a club with her sister. Also Bobby is shown dancing with her sister.
The flashbacks eventually lead to revealing that Sam committed suicide for which Sid thinks of himself as the cause. Sam's death was due to his troubled past and his relationship with his mother, not because of his best friend Sid. Upon finding this out, Sid and Nayantara reunite.
There is a reunion between the remaining cowboys as they remember the past and the cherished moments they spent with each other and with their friend Sam, because if Sam were alive, that is exactly what he would've done as some friendships last forever.
