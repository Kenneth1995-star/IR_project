New Faces

The film was essentially a reproduction of the stage revue with a thin plot added. This involved a producer and performer (Ronny Graham) in financial trouble on opening night. A wealthy Texan, whose daughter is in the show, offers to help out on the condition that he finds the show to be of high-enough quality and commercial potential to warrant the investment. Meanwhile, Graham locks a bill collector in a dressing room until the show is finished and he can collect the money.[1]
