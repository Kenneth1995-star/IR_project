Satellite in the Sky

After initial experiments using high-speed aircraft, scientists in Great Britain create the "Stardust", the first manned spaceship to orbit the Earth. Some of the crew members have concerned loved ones. Barbara (Thea Gregory), the wife of Larry Noble (Jimmy Hanley), and Ellen (Shirley Lawrence), the girlfriend of radio operator Jimmy Wheeler (Bryan Forbes), are afraid that the space flight will be dangerous.
Although the crew, headed by Commander Michael Haydon (Kieron Moore), initially believe they are on a scientific mission, the scientist on board, Professor Merrity (Donald Wolfit), is really working for the United States to test an experimental nuclear "Tritonium Bomb". The object is to use the explosion to persuade nations to abandon nuclear weapons.
Complications arise when Haydon discovers a stowaway. Troublesome reporter Kim Hamilton (Lois Maxwell) also opposes the mission as a reckless and unnecessary use of space flight, and has hidden aboard to disrupt the mission.
The Tritonium Bomb is to be released into space, but when its propulsion unit fails and the bomb has attached itself to the hull of the spaceship, everyone's life is threatened. The crew and their unwanted guest race against time to defuse or destroy the bomb.
