Parayan Marannathu (പറയാൻ മറന്നതു്)

Chandran (Biju Menon) lives in a small village called Kannadipuzha. Chandran's family comprises his wife Rema (Lakshmi Sharma) and daughter Maalu. Chandran has a neighbour Madhavi (Kalaranjini) who washes clothes for a living. She was born in a rich family but her husband and his family rejected her . Her daughter Gauri is a plus-two student.
Manikantan, a young man in the village, always tries to help Madhavi since Madhavi brought him up after his mother died and he likes Gauri, but Gauri never feels interested in him. Gauri (Vidya) falls in love with Chandran changing her life completely.
