Sawaari

The film starts with a murder mystery. The main plot deals with how an Assistant Commissioner of Police is in the pursuit of finding the psycho killer. There is a sub plot of the film that talks about a harmless driver who aims to deliver a car on time from Chennai to Nellore but ends up getting into a tangle.
Sawaari is road psycho thriller movie that you have seen since 1950s in Hollywood but Kollywood hasn’t tried it yet. Rajat Mukherjee from RGV stable tried his hand on it with Road in Bollywood and it bombed miserably. It’s not an easy path to take because you have to do a lot of work to preserve the attention of the audience.
The movie starts with a police investigation of a triple murder that is suspected to have been done by a psycho serial killer. The investigating officer, Solomon (played Benito Franklin Alex) is about to get married the next day and tries to take a break by subordinating the investigation. On a parallel side, Ravi (Karthik Yogi) is on the road to deliver a car (a Contessa classic 1990 model) to a superstitious MLA at Nellore. Solomon’s car breaks down and he hitch hikes with Ravi. The rest of the story revolves on how the psycho killer is identified in the road trip they take from Chennai to Nellore. [8]
