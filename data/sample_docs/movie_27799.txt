Meesa Madhavan

Madhavan (Dileep) is a clever thief who robs for a living and is well known in the village. He is following the principles of his mentor Mullani Pappan (Mala Aravindan)who trained him to be a thief when Madhavan was a young boy. Meesa Madhavan got his name by the popular saying that if Madhavan rolls his Moustache (Meesa in Malayalam) looking at someone, he will rob his house that night. His enemy is the local money lender Bhageerathan Pillai (Jagathy Sreekumar) who refuses to give back his father's property despite Madhavan paying back the loan with interest years ago.
Madhavan falls in love with Bhageerathan Pillai's daughter Rukmini (Kavya Madhavan). Despite being childhood friends, in the beginning of the movie Rukmini hates Madhavan as he is a well known thief in the locality. But later on when she realizes that Madhavan's sisters marriage was cancelled because of her father, she slowly started falling for him and later both fall in love with each other. The sub inspector in the village Eappen Pappachi (Indrajith) has an eye on Rukmini. He steals the idol from the local Temple with the intention of selling it and puts the blame on Madhavan. It becomes Madhavan's responsibility to find the culprits and he does that with his mentor's help and thus uniting with his girl friend.
