Parsley Days

Kate (Megan Dunlop) is a bike-maintenance instructor who realized she is no longer in love with her boyfriend of five years, Ollie (Michael Leblanc). Kate and Ollie have been together since high school. Kate finds out she is pregnant, which complicates the whole situation because she is not sure if she truly does want to breakup with Ollie or not. However, Kate does not want to have a baby, but does not want to wait weeks for a clinical abortion, so her herbalist friend, Chloe (Marcia Connolly) tells her that being on a parsley diet can make you have a natural abortion. Kate then goes on to constantly eat parsley and at one point in the film, even bathe in parsley. Ollie is "the king of contraception", where he counsels people on contraception for his job. Kate's friends see Kate and Ollie's relationship as the greatest relationship there could ever be and they envy her for it, even her lesbian friend thinks she would be crazy to leave him. Kate decides it is for the best not to tell Ollie about the pregnancy, despite her friends telling her she should. The film suggests that Kate may have had an affair with her "slow student" and may be the real reason why she wants an abortion. However, we find out that Ollie purposely poked holes in the condom, attempting to save their relationship together by having a child.
Kate ultimately decides that breaking up with Ollie and moving on is for the best. Kate and Ollie both agree to meet at the lake in ten years, which is the spot the two of them first fell in love in the first place.[2]
