Vattaram

Burma (Arya) is the son of a driver (Nassar) in a rich man Gurupadam’s (Napoleon) house. Gurupadam is Burma’s role model, and his dream is to be like him. Soon, his father is framed by Ayravadham (Kadhal Dandapani), Gurupadam's right-hand man, and unable to bear the humiliation, he commits suicide. Burma grows up in the mean streets to be a gun dealer and waits for an opportunity to enter Gurupadam’s house and take revenge.
Soon he wins over Gurupadam and his only daughter Sangeetha (Kirat Bhattal). But Ayra and Veeravel (Ramji), Gurupadom’s elder son, are tooth and nail opposed to him and fear that he will take over their empire. However, Burma uses tact and cunningness to overcome their resentment and wins over Gurupadom’s trust. Slowly, he starts to understand the machinations of the power play in the underworld. He uses Gurupadom’s bitter foe Karuppusamy (Avinash) to his advantage and causes havoc which leads to a gripping climax.
