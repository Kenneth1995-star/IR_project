Carry on Jatta

Jass (Gippy Grewal) falls in love with Mahie (Mahie Gill) at a friends wedding, but she only wants to marry someone who doesn't have a family and is an orphan like herself because she doesn't want to deal with the nagging and interference of in laws post marriage. So to woo her Jass pretends he's an orphan and she falls in love with him, but when she tells her brother he forces them to marry right away or else he won't agree. So Jass marries Mahie without telling his father Advocate Dhillon (Jaswinder Bhalla), brother Goldy Dhillon (Binnu Dhillon) or his wife Diljit Dhillon (Anshu Sawhney). Now after marriage Jass tells Mahie to find them a place to stay and she finds a sublease room in Jass's own home and that's where the comedy of errors begins. Jass and his best friend Honey (Gurpreet Ghuggi) cook up several plans to confuse Jass's family so Jass can live with his wife Mahie in his own home without his family ever finding out. But in between all this Honey marries his girlfriend Preet (Khushboo Grewal) in secret because his dad Inspector Sikhander Tiwana (B.N. Sharma) won't agree to his marriage but Honey tricks Preet's parents into believing that she's marrying Jass without Jass even knowing it. Hence a madcap comedy of errors ensues and ultimately the outcome is a comically charged climax of marital mix ups.
