Thaai Manasu

The film begins with Chinna Marudhu giving milk (custom in village) to end the sufferings of his mother Muthamma (Manorama).
In the past, Thangapandi (Vijayakumar) was the village chief and was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, he was married to Muthamma. They had two sonsÂ : Periya Marudhu (Babloo Prithiveeraj) and Chinna Marudhu (Saravanan). Chinna Marudhu and Annalakshmi (Suvarna Mathew) were in love since their childhood while Periya Marudhu fell in love with Rasathi (Meera). The two young couples finally got married with their parents' blessings.
Thangapandi's village was the only village where the citizens didn't vote for the elections. Only because Thangapandi hated the politicians and lost faith in politics. Being an important and populated village in the district, the politicians tried to convince Thangapandi but they failed each time so they charged the heartless liquor smuggler Kangeyan (Karikalan) to change the villagers' mind. First, Kangeyan sent his henchmen to kill Thangapandi but Chinna Marudhu and Periya Marudhu saved him at time. Then, Kangeyan brainwashed the weak brother Periya Marudhu and turned him against his family. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
