Someone to Talk To

Cobbler Niu Aiguo is in conflict with his wife, while his older sister, street food vender Niu Aixiang, considers marriage later in life. Both desperately want to communicate with someone, though their own situations are at opposite poles. Aiguo then breaks up with his wife and Aixiang marries divorcée Song Jiefang. Aiguo runs into his childhood friend Chuhong while searching for his wife and falls into conversation with her. It turns out that she is also divorced as a result of communication failure and it seems Aixiang and Jiefang can’t get along either.[3]
