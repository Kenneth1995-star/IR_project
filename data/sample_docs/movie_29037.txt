Penn Manam

Paramasivam, a farmer who lives with his wife Meenakshi and three children in Thanjavur, finds life difficult. Unable to face the difficulties, he goes to Colombo without informing his wife, and joins a drama troupe there. One of his children dies and Meenakshi is harassed by people. She tries to kill the other two children along with herself by jumping into a river with the children. However, they are saved by a sadhu (ascetic). In Colombo, Paramasivam saves a child from being run over by a car. The car owner gives Paramasivam money in gratitude, and the latter returns to his village in India. Whether he succeeds in finding his family and whether all are able to live together forms the rest of the story.[1]
