After the Show

As described in a film magazine,[4] country girl Eileen (Lee) comes to New York City to make her career on the stage. She is rescued from want by Pop O'Malley (Ogle), an aged actor who works as a door keeper, and finds employment in the chorus. Larry Taylor (Holt), a wealthy man-about-town, seeks to win her without benefit of clergy. She falls in love with him and, against Pop's instructions, goes to his house. Knowing what awaits her there, Pop follows her with a resulting dramatic ending.
