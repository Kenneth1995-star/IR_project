Samaj Ko Badal Dalo

Kishore (Arun) and Manorama (Mridula) are in love with but unable to get married. Mridula's father is a clerk, who can't afford to pay the dowry demanded by Arun's family. Jayant (Yakub) is a widower, and Mridula is married off to him. His cruel behaviour becomes apparent when he starts torturing Mridula soon after their marriage. Arun's parents get him married to the rich Champa (Leela Pawar) who is in love with someone else. Arun helps her get married to Naresh, the man she loves, by giving her a divorce. Arun watches the torture inflicted on Mridula and the story then continues through tense scenes where eventually Arun kills Jayant and unwittingly Mridula too, following which he's sent to a mental asylum having been declared insane.
