Intimate Confessions Of A Chinese Courtesan

In what is regarded as one of the most outrageous and taboo-smashing Shaw Brothers classics, sweet young Ai Nu (Lily Ho) is abducted and sold to the popular Four Seasons brothel run by lusty madam Chun Yi (Betty Pei Ti), who falls for her nubile charge and entrusts her with a number of martial arts secrets like "Ghost Hands," which allows a fighter to plunge into an opponentâ€™s chest.
Soon murder erupts within the brothel, and a policeman must race against time to prevent a vicious revenge plot from reaching its blood-spattered conclusion.
