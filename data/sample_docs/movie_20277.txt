Are You Being Served?

As Grace Brothers is being redecorated, the management sends the staff on a paid holiday to resort Costa Plonka, in Spain. Their hotel and its surroundings prove to be dismal, and the group tries to pass the time by acting on the crushes they have developed for one another in the workplace.
After the eventful plane flight, the staff arrive at the hotel; they are greeted by the hotel manager Carlos who says that no rooms are available until the day afterwards, but luxury penthouses are available for the night, so the staff decide to sleep in the penthouses. It turns out that Carlos's English isn't too good and gets his "T"s and "P"s muddled up, so he actually meant "tenthouses." After a dinner of love-note misunderstandings the staff all need the loo after Carlos pours tropical drinks into the glasses with a small jug.
Meanwhile, Carlos receives an unwelcome visit from an old acquaintance named Cesar who is after Mrs Slocombe after seeing her (doctored) passport. He is also plotting a revolutionary uprising and wants to use the hotel as his base.
The staff then decide to turn in for the night, but a night of tent-swapping disturbs everyone. As Cesar is still after Mrs Slocombe, he goes into her tent to find Mr Humphries instead! After waking up the next morning, the Grace Brothers staff get a nasty surprise, narrowly surviving a gunfight between the revolutionaries and govt troops. During the gunfight, Cesar flees, taking refuge in the outside toilet which the staff accidentally attach to an advertising balloon sending him floating into the air . They are saved by a group of tanks that arrive on the scene; these prove to have been commandeered by Young Mr. Grace, who wanted to visit his beleaguered underlings, but could not find a taxi.
