O Seeta Katha

Seeta (Roja Ramani), a teenage girl, lives with her mother and elder sister (Subha) who runs the house with her harikatha performances. Seeta falls in love with Chandram (Chandramohan), but evil Gopalakrishna (Devadas Kanakala) has an eye on her and hires goons to bash Chandram, who dies on the spot. Seeta marries Madhava Rao (Kantha Rao), father of Gopalakrishna, and makes Gopalakrishna realize his mistakes.
