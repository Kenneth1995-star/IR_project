Ghar Ka Chiraag

Madho suffers through misfortunes in his life. Unable to bear the anguish anymore, he leaves his wife and small child, moving to Bombay. From being a good man, he reinvents himself by turning into the vicious Kalu, who kidnaps children and maims them then makes them beg on the streets. After several years, his son Birju, now a grown boy, leaves the village to search for his father and comes to Bombay. Here he is ensnared in Kalu's gang and blinded. He is then sent to beg with the other children.
