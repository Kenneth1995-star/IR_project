Road, Movie

Vishnu (Abhay Deol), a restless young man, itches to escape his father's faltering hair oil business.
An old truck beckons, which, Vishnu sees as his ticket to freedom. He offers to drive the 1942 Chevrolet across the desert to the sea, where it has been sold to a local museum. As he sets off across the harsh terrain of desert India, Vishnu discovers he is not merely transporting a battered vehicle but an old touring cinema.
Along the way, Vishnu reluctantly picks up a young runaway (Mohammed Faizal Usmani), a wandering old entertainer (Satish Kaushik) and a striking gypsy woman (Tannishtha Chatterjee). Together they roam in the barren land, searching for water and an elusive fair. The journey turns dire when they are waylaid by corrupt cops and a notorious water lord.
The key to their freedom is the eccentric collection of films and the two forty-year-old film projectors in the back of the truck. As in One Thousand and One Nights, if the films are good, they live and move on. If the films are boring, they face death in the outback.
The journey proves transformative for each of the travelers, but especially for Vishnu who discovers life, love and laughter on the Indian highway.
