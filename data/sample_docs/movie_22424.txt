Bon Cop, Bad Cop 2

Following the events of the first film, Martin Ward (Feore) and David Bouchard (Huard) remained friends but have gradually grown apart as their lives and careers have taken them in different directions; Ward is now a senior officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, while Bouchard remains undercover with the Sûreté du Québec. This time, their roles are reversed: Ward takes the lead, and has his turn experiencing challenges in his personal life. In the present day, the two are reunited to investigate a car theft ring which turns out to be a front for a much bigger terrorist plot.[6]
Critics say the film gave their audience exactly what they expected: humour, action and nostalgia. [7] Fans claim the actors display the same chemistry as the first film, and ratings reflect high satisfaction from viewers.
