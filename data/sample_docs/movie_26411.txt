Umar

Chandrakant Mehta (Prem Chopra), Rajpal Singh (Satish Kaushik) and Iqbal Khan (Kader Khan) are best friends, living their last years in United Kingdom. The lives of the men are complicated as Mehta and Singh are mistreated as servants by their own children and Khan is victim of racial discrimination from the British community. However, they find solace and love in form of a caring young man Shashank Dutt (Jimmy Sheirgill). Shashank is a student and works as a part-time waiter and singer in a bar for a living and is in love with Sapna Lakha (Shenaz Treasurywala), daughter of a rich business tycoon Prem Lakha (Shakti Kapoor). Sapna introduces Shashank to her father for marriage but the latter disagrees because of Shashank's status. However, the owner of the bar Victoria falls for Shashank and he rejects her advances, as he is still loyal to Sapna. But one day Victoria gets murdered and all the evidences points towards Shashank. Shashank is arrested and jailed by the police thereafter. After learning this incident, the three men help Shashank in his escape, which also turns them into fugitives as well.
