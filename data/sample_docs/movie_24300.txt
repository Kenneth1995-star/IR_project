Hamrahi

Anup (Radhamohan) lives with his mother and sister, Sumitra (Rekha Mitra/Mallick). He writes at a newspaper office to make a living. Sumitra is friends with a rich girl, Gopa (Binota Bose/Roy). Gopa is celebrating her birthday and invites Sumitra to the party. Gopa's sister-in-law Roopa, who alleges that Sumitra is a thief, humiliates Sumitra. Gopa repulsed at Roopa's blatant arrogance and show of wealth, goes to Sumitra's house to apologise. She meets Anup there who refuses to accept her apology, equating the insult to all poor people.
Anup's boss sends him to Rajendra's office for some writing work. Rajendra is Gopa's brother and Roopa's husband. He needs a speech and commissions Anup write it for him. The speech is well received at the function Rajendra attends, and he develops pretensions of being a writer. Rajendra manages to steal the manuscript of a novel Anup is working on, which has an idealistic theme on poverty. He has it published with his name as author, getting critical acclaim for his intellectual abilities.
Rajendra's company workers go on a strike, dissatisfied with the pay and conditions of the factory. Anup and Gopa get involved in the factory workers problem, and join them in their agitation. Rajendra with the help of bribed workers and local goons disrupts the strike. Disillusioned by wealth and the hypocrisy, Gopa sympathises with the workers. She leaves her home and comfort behind, and joins Anup.
