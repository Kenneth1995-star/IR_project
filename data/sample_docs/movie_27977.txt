The film narrates the story of "Cuba" Mukundan (Sreenivasan) . He is a staunch leftist who lives for the movement. Machinations of a corrupt politician Karunan (Guruvayoor Sivaji) who perceives Mukundan as a threat to his political career force Mukundan to take up a job in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Even in Dubai, he finds that Kunjunny Muthalaly (Jagathy Sreekumar) who was in league with Karunan is in Dubai, exploiting the helpless labourers who migrate to the Persian Gulf region, performing menial jobs and physical labor in order to support their families back home. He has always had a soft corner for People's Republic of China as a result of his leftist leanings and when he meets Zhang Chu Min (Zhang Chu Min), a Chinese girl, she quickly finds a special place in his heart as she symbolizes China to him. Later even after realising that she is an anti communist and is there to make money for the treatment of her boyfriend who fought against the Chinese Government, he gives her his earnings saying a communist never keeps money more than his requirements. Mukundan, with the help of his friends Anwar (Indrajith Sukumaran), Maya (Samvrutha Sunil), and Karim (Salim Kumar), exposes the machinations of Karunan and Kunjunny Muthalaly. Finally Mukundan returns home to work for the political cause which has been his life and love. ` The movie depicts Mukundan who lives in backward Kerala being catapulted into the real world of commerce and industry that gives employment opportunity to workers from Kerala. Mukundan who finds himself in present society where sticking to any ideology without any compromises is perceived as something of an anachronism.
