Sadhurangam

Thirupathisamy aka Thiru (Srikanth) is an investigative journalist working for a Tamil magazine. He fearlessly brings out the issues in the prevailing political system which earns him many enemies. Thiru falls in love with Sandhya (Sonia Agarwal), a college student. Thiru, in one of his articles, writes about the problems faced by prisoners following which the SP Rajan (Ganesh Yadav) gets suspended. He also writes about the corruption of an IAS officer leading to his transfer and about the real estate mafia run by an influential man (Mahadevan).
One day, Sandhya gets kidnapped and Thiru gets a threatening call. But Thiru is unable to trace the culprit as he has so many enemies. Initially he suspects Mahadevan but later finds that Rajan was the man behind the kidnap. Thiru flashes Sandhyaâ€™s pictures in the magazines and finds out that Rajan has planned to sell her to a brothel in Dubai. Thiru rushes to the railway station where Sandhya is present. He fights against Rajan and kills him. Mahadevan comes to the spot and helps Thiru escape. Finally Thiru and Sandhya are united.
