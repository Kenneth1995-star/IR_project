Kochu Thresia (Sheela), is a rich widow living a retired life in a quaint but beautiful village filled with eclectic characters. Living with her are her eldest son and family. Her son and daughter-in-law are tired of Kochu Thresia's lovable eccentricities which they consider bad behavior for a woman of her age. Her children consider her a nuisance who creates unnecessary trouble for them in their busy lives. Though old, Kochu Thresia is still young at heart and knows how to enjoy life, getting into humorous predicaments which only incenses her grown-up kids. At this juncture, she meets the young, down-to-earth Reji (Jayaram) in whom she finds a sympathetic and understanding friend, and starts seeing him like a son. Reji eagerly fulfills all her wishes. From savouring the mouth-watering but forbidden beef to riding on the elephant, they enjoy all the moments spent together.
