Troublesome Night 19

Audrey finds a pair of sunglasses at the beach. That night, she dreams about a girl who was murdered on the beach. After consulting the expert ghostbuster Mrs Bud Lung, Audrey learns that the ghost wants to tell her about her fate. Mrs Bud urges Audrey to return the sunglasses back to where she found them. She becomes unconscious and experiences a vision of the entire murder. While having dinner later, Audrey recognises Lee Ka-hing, a famous tycoon, as the murderer. She allows the victim's ghost to possess her and force Lee to confess.
