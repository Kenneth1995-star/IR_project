Iru Thuruvam

The film is about two brothers, Rangan and Durai, growing up in a village controlled by an evil landlord. When Rangan is framed by the landlord for a crime he did not commit, he escapes to the mountains with his girlfriend, Kumari, and joins a band of bandits. His younger brother, Durai, is sent to the city for his education and becomes a police officer. Years later, when Rangan is about to become a father, he decides to return to the village to ask for forgiveness. However, Durai wants him to surrender to the police for his crimes and when Rangan refuses and tries to leave, Durai shoots him dead. Rangan's death rendered more poignant by the fact that it was his money that paid for Durai's education and allowed him to become a policeman.
