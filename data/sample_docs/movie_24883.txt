Duvidha

The film is set in rural Rajasthan. It is based on a story by Vijayadan Detha, which relates a popular folktale from Rajasthan about a merchant's son, Krishanlal (Ravi Menon), whose relationship with his young bride, Lachhi (Raisa Padamsee), is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband.[3]
