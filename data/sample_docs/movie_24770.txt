Jawab

Raja (Jeetendra) lives with his widowed sister Divya (Meena Kumari) in a small village. He is constantly being made a target by the oppressive local Zamindar (Ashok Kumar) and his two children, Sagar (Prem Chopra) and Chanchal (Leena Chandavarkar). The land owner's children decide to take revenge on Raja by getting Sagar married to Raja's sweetheart Neela. The Zamindar also molests Raja's sister, who kills herself. With his Neela married and his sister dead, a devastated Raja heads to the city. Once there, he attempts to put his life together and forget the past. It is then that he meets with another victim of the Zamindar, Bajrangi (Mehmood), and together they conceive a plan that will avenge them against their oppressors. The question is, will they succeed or will there be more victims?
