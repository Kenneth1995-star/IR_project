Balaraju

The story begins in heaven a Devakanya Mohini and a Yaksha are in love. Indra, the ruler of Suvarloka, has an interest in Mohini. His emissary Kubera, unable to separate the lovers, curses Yaksha to be born as a human. Mohini refuses to bow to the wish of Indra, who then curses her to be born as a human and pine for her lover. The Yaksha, now Balaraju, is brought up by a shepherd. Mohini is found in a field by Kamma Naidu, who names her Sita and brings her up. As she grows up, pressure mounts on him to perform her marriage. Fearing that the wealth he had acquired after her arrival may disappear if she leaves him, he refuses to get her married and keeps her in a solitary tower in a forest.
Balaraju and his companion Yelamanda pass by that route. Attracted by the music that Balaraju plays on his flute, Sita escapes to meet him. She recognizes him, but his memory fails him due to the curse. She makes attempts to revive their love. The story takes interesting twists when the hero is turned into a snake by an angry sage. Balaraju regains his memory and realizes that he is in love with Sita. Indra once again makes an attempt to separate the lovers. Unable to bear any further agony, Sita is all set to curse Indra when the Gods appear and Indra seeks Sitaâ€™s pardon. He invites the couple to Suvarloka, but Balaraju and Mohini prefer a blissful life on the earth.
