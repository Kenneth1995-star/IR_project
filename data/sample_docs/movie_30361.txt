Sandhitha Velai

Aadalarasu(Karthik) is an unemployed youth looking for a job. He is constantly taunted on this account by his father(Vijayakumar) while his mother(Sujatha) comes to his support. In Madras for a job interview, he stays with his father's friend(Moulee). He has run-ins with the friend's daughter Thilaka(Roja) and she develops a dislike for him. But she bows to her father's wishes and weds Aadalarasu. Just when she starts liking him, he has to travel again. In the train, he meets Thirunaavukkarasu(Karthik again) who asks him for a favor. Instead of the usual comedy, the mistaken identity is then played for sentiments. With Thirunaavukkarasu dying and being mistaken for Aadalarasu, Aadalarasu's family thinks he is dead while he takes Thirunaavukkarasu's place and helps them. But he has to do so without arousing the suspicions of his wife Akalya(Kausalya) and the rest of his family.[3]
