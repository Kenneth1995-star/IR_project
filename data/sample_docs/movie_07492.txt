Gun Street

Frank Bogan (Warren Kemmerling), a violent criminal sentenced to the death penalty, escapes from prison and vows revenge against those he blames for his capture. Local sheriff Chuck Morton (James Brown) is tasked with warning Bogan's likely victims. At the top of Morton's list are Bogan's ex-wife, Janice (Peggy Stewart) ; her new husband, Dr. Dean Knudtson (John Pickard) ; and Jeff Baxley (Herb Armstrong), whose testimony in court helped convict Bogan.
