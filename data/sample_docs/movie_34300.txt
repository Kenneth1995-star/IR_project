Looking for Love

The plot concerns three characters who have lost hope in continuing their lives in Korea—Kokosu (Lee Geum-ryong), an old man who has lost his farmland; Dong-min (Na Woon-gyu); and Jong-hui (Jeong Ok), who had been betrayed by her boyfriend. Kokosu had been a bugler in the Korean military during the last days of the Joseon Dynasty. Seeking a better life in northeast China, the three are attacked by bandits and the Japanese while attempting the ice-covered Tumen River crossing of the China–North Korea border . With his last breath, Kokosu blows the army bugle he had carried with him all his life. Dong-min takes the bugle and continues playing it.
