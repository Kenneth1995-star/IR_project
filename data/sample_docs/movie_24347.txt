Hanuman Patal Vijay

The story is about Hanuman and his confrontations with The King of Patal, Ahiravan, and his brother Mahiravan, who have been asked by Ravan to kill Ram and Lakshman. The film follows Hanuman's encounter with Makari, the daughter of the sea, who wants to marry him, but instead through the swallowing of a bead of his sweat she gives birth to Makardhwaj who guards the gates of Patal (Hell) where Ram and Lakshman are taken when kidnapped. Hanuman gets the better of Makardhwaj and rescues Ram and Lakshman. A major battle ensues and Ahiravan and Mahiravan are killed, but somehow they keep regenerating. Hanuman manages to find out the secret of their regeneration and puts a stop to it with the help of Ahiravan's wife Chandrasena.
