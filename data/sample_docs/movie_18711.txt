Journey Together

Two RAF aircrew cadets, Jack Wilton (Richard Attenborough) and John Aynesworth (Jack Watling) become friends. A friendly rivalry develops between the two while they are training, and it ends in a bet. They both pass their initial training and are sent to the United States for more advanced instruction. However, once there, it becomes clear that Corporal Wilton, while he is otherwise a great pilot, cannot land a plane because of his inability to judge height. Wilton is devastated, and the feeling worsens when he sees that Aynsworth is a natural pilot. Aynsworth proceeds with his pilotâ€™s training, and Wilton is sent up to Canada to be trained as a navigator instead.
He turns out to be a good navigator, but he shows no interest in his training, and falls behind his peers. Then, on a practice flight, through the connivance of his trainer and Aynsworth, he realizes how important his job is. After graduating, he serves as navigator to Aynesworth on a bombing operation. During the raid, the plane is hit and begins to lose fuel; Wilton must demonstrate everything he learned when they have to land in the sea and he communicates their position. It turns out that he perfectly calculated their position, and the rescue plane quickly finds them.
