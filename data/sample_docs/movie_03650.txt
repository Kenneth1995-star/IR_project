Reveille with Beverly

Beverly Ross (Ann Miller) wants to be a radio personality, but has to run the switchboard at a local station. The blustery station owner Mr. Kennedy (Tim Ryan) wants no part of programming the "jive that she loves", preferring the classics.[3]
After struggling to keep her time slot, Beverly broadcasts her show from an Army base.[4]
