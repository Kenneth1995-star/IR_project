Balala the Fairies

Mei-xue (美雪) and Mei-qi (美琪), are at stargazing camp with a few friends. A few months in, they saw some meteorites that crashed onto the earth. When Mei-xue (美雪) and Mei-qi (美琪), went to check things out, they found a strange but pretty looking stone with a badly wounded bird. They take the bird home to look after it and end up finding Xiao-lan (小蓝), back from Fairyland. They must complete a new mission.
