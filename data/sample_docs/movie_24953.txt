Raftaar

Rani (Moushumi Chatterjee) is a village girl living with her ever-grumbling step-mother (Lalita Kumari) and father (Jankidas). At the start of the film, she is shown playing kabaddi with other girls. They trouble the village simpleton Banelal (Birbal) and are reprimanded by his father (Sunder). While trying to get water from the village well, Rani slips and falls inside. Vikram (Vinod Mehra), who works for Pramod Kumar (Danny Denzongpa) as a manager is sent to the village to get some job done. He stops to fill water in his car, which has heated up and helps Rani by pulling her out of the well. Vikram falls in love with her and promises to marry her when he saves her from committing suicide to avoid an arranged marriage. Kumar arrives at the village and on seeing Radha, demands of his housekeeper (Paro), who also supplies him women, to get Rani for him. He sends Vikram on a pretext to the city and rapes Rani. Rani is seen jumping into the river by the housekeeper. Rani, however, is saved by a kind-hearted Christian gentleman (Madan Puri), who lost his daughter, Rita, several years ago.
Vikram gets implicated in some wrongdoing and is sent to prison for a year. On his return, he finds Kumar attempting to rape another girl and is hurt in the fight. He's found unconscious by some gypsies who care for him. He then helps a young woman, Radha (Arpana Chaudhary) and her child, to search for her husband, and shifts to the city. Kumar sees Rani who is now pretending to be Rita when he hears her sing at a function. Rita/Rani is after revenge and pretends to be friendly with Kumar. Following some fight scenes and melodramatic moments, Kumar repents when he finds he has a son, and goes to jail. Vikram and Rani get together.
