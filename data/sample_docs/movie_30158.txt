However, a few months into their relationship, Arun and Mridula get in an accident and he passes away. A devastated Mridula is unable to get over her loss, and before long starts seeing Arun in strange visions everywhere she goes. Her family eventually decide that relocating to another country might help Mridula move on, and so they send her to the UK. Once she arrives there, she meets Mano, a young man attracted to her. She knows that her parents expect her to fall for Mano. But as she can't move on, she runs away. She meets a person who looks exactly like Arun. She follows him and finds out where he lives and works. Whenever she tries to talk to him, he denies his relationship with her and says he doesn't know her. However, she later finds out that her father had Arun sent away as he had helped with Arun's sister's marriage and had threatened to let it all go downhill for her. Arun moves to UK in hopes that he can forget about Mridula but he can't and when he meets her, he realises this. When Mridula's father finds out Arun is still alive, he tries to kill him. However he realises his mistake and lets the lovebirds reunite.
