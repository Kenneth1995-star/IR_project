Aamne Samne

Gopi (Mithun Chakraborty) is a simple-minded villager who travels to Mumbai looking for a job. He is approached by some men who mistake him for Johnny (also Mithun Chakraborty). Johnny is a criminal who works for the underworld don Supremo (Kamal Kapoor) and is also a stage performer by day to cover up his criminal activities. When he meets his lookalike, Johnny decides to use him as a fall guy in case the police discover who he is. Gopi is trained into becoming Johnny to convincingly impersonate him, unknowingly becoming an accomplice to Johnny's crimes. When the police discover Johnny has stolen valuable statues, Gopi is blamed and must prove his innocence to everyone.
