Tehran

In 1943, Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt meet at the Teheran conference to agree plans for the Allied invasion of Europe. Whilst attempting to trace ballerina Natalie Trubetzin (Marta Labarr), who he met before the outbreak of war, British journalist Pemberton Grant (Derek Farr) uncovers a deadly conspiracy. The plot, led by Paul Sherek (Manning Whiley), involves international arms dealers, who can't afford to, and do not wish to have peace declared, and plan to blow up President Roosevelt during his visit.
