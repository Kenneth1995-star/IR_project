Where the Spies Are

Rosser, a British agent is assassinated in Beirut. British intelligence boss MacGillivray recruits Dr Jason Love, who did some intelligence work during World War Two, to attend a medical conference and find out what is going on.
Love stops off in Paris and meets MagGillivray's contact, a model called Vikki. The two get along well, causing Love to miss his flight, which promptly explodes.
Love arrives in Beirut and meets another agent, Parkington. Together they discover a communist plot to assassinate the pro-British Prince of Zahlouf, thereby threatening Britain's Eastern oil treaties.
Parkington is killed and Love meets up with Vikki again, who reveals she is a double agent. Love manages to stop the assassination, but when escaping is captured by the Russians.
They put him on a plane touring the world, the "Dove of Peace", and try to extract information from him. Also on board is Vikki.
A Russian defector reveals Love's location to the British. When the plane flies over Canada, the British arrange a fake emergency so the plane will land. Vikki shoots the Russians enabling Love to escape but she is killed in turn.
