Night Ride

Young truck driver Dick Benson (Jimmy Hanley) and friend Alf Higgins (Wally Patch) set up their own haulage company with the financial backing of Tony Spinelli (Julian Vedey), an Italian restaurant owner. However, their former boss Arthur Wilson (Frank Petley), concerned about the competition, uses underhand methods to try and sabotage the enterprise. Wilson sends his attractive daughter Ruth (Elizabeth Kent) to seduce Dick, and a group of thugs to work over their trucks. Wilson very nearly succeeds, but Dick and the truckers make a success of themselves by rescuing miners trapped in a flooded mine.
