Kelly + Victor

Kelly and Victor meet on the dance floor of a Liverpool nightclub, both of them on drugs. They quickly leave the club and return to Kelly's flat where they take more drugs and drink whiskey together. While they have sex, Kelly chokes and bites Victor for sexual gratification and admits to him in the morning that she got carried away.
Kelly's fetish is mirrored when she joins her dominatrix friend in whipping a masked male to earn some money, but she struggles to play the roll of dominatrix and doesn't enjoy the experience. On a visit to her Mum's house, Kelly finds that her Mum has invited around her ex-boyfriend, who is clearly still infatuated with Kelly but is not allowed within three metres due to a restraining order.
Victor sets up another date with Kelly, telling her in the pub that he would do anything for her and that their relationship is something special. Later, Kelly ties Victor's hands while they have sex, chokes him and carves the phrase 'V + A' into his back using cut glass. Victor tells his friends and sister that he no longer wants to see Kelly but is clearly still preoccupied by her.
After returning from a party, Victor finds Kelly bleeding in the street after she has been attacked by her ex-boyfriend. He takes her to A&E and the two return home again together. Kelly again strangles Victor with a tie, him insisting that he will tap her when he's had enough. But Kelly gets carried away and doesn't notice that Victor is unable to tap her. He dies from asphyxiation, leaving Kelly distraught and listening to a CD mixtape that he made for her.
