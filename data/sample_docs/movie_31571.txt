Panduranga Mahatyam

Pundarika (N.T. Rama Rao) is from a pious Brahmin family who is not interested in the worship of God and irreligious, a complete rebel who is asked to mend the ways, he neglects his parents Jahnu Sarma (Chittoor V Nagaiah) & Lakshmi (Rushendramani) and wife Rama (Anjali Devi). He steals their gold for a prostitute Kalavathy (B. Saroja Devi), she takes all his wealth and throws him out. Not yet a changed man, the wandering Pundarik sets his sight on the three river goddesses Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati who is serving sage Kukkuta’s ashram to get rid of the impurities passed on to them by the sinners who took bath in their rivers. He also insults Kukkuta who is serving his parents at that time. When he tries to kick the sage, Pundarik loses his legs. Repentant Pundarik crawls his way to find his parents and falls at their feet seeking pardon. He regains his limbs and prays to Lord Panduranga to grant him the boon of merging into him along with his parents — giving the message that one has to serve one's parents and it is the quickest way to Salvation.
