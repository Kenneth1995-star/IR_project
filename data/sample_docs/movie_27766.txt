Ishtam

Pawan (Dileep), whose mother died when he was young 24 years ago, lives with his widower father Krishnankutty Menon (Nedumudi Venu), a rich businessman. His father frequently and hilariously gets in trouble with the police (Kalpana), mostly due to his best friend, Narayanan(Innocent (actor)). Pavan meets Anjana (Navya Nair), who was his old college mate, who lives with her music teacher Sridevi, who is unmarried. It turns out that Krishnankutty Menon and Sridevi(Jayasudha) were actually star-crossed lovers when they were young. Pavan, Anjana, Narayanan(Innocent) and Pavan's brother(Sreenivasan) make a plan to reunite them after all these years - and in the process, Pavan and Anjana discover their feelings for each other as well.
