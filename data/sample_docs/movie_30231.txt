Nandhini

The movie 'Nandhini' traces the metamorphosis of a young college going girl, Raji. Raji is in love with Suresh but strange stories of her mother Nandhini being linked with Rangaswamy, their paying guest, deeply affect her. Raji questions Rangaswamy but he is deeply anguished by her behaviour and suffers a heart attack that ultimately ends the Good Samaritan’s life. Raji is emotionally disturbed and refuses any association with Suresh, and seeks solace with Nandhini. However Nandhini’s strange behaviour devastates her and she wishes to get back with Suresh. Finally, Suresh comes to know about the story about Prakash and Nandhini's love and reunites with Raji in the end, and escorts her from Chennai to Mumbai. Kannadi Vijay then promises to take care of Nandhini.
