Nobody's Perfect

A US Navy submarine rescue ship's crew has taken a Buddha statue from a Japanese village as souvenir. If the theft is discovered, it would threaten Japanese/American relations. The protagonist is one of the ship's chief petty officers who tries to stay out of trouble with his tough captain, return the statue and woo a US Navy Nurse of Japanese-American descent.
This military service comedy chronicles the misadventures of the fictional US Navy submarine rescue vessel, USS Bustard, forward deployed/homeported in Japan. Junior members of the Bustard's crew have stolen a Buddha statue from a rural Japanese village, which if discovered missing would threaten Japanese/American relations. Doc Willoughby (McClure), a Chief Petty Officer, is the ship's Independent Duty Medical Corpsman, whose antics are constantly getting him into trouble with his ship's captain (Whitmore). While on liberty ashore, Willoughby falls for a seemingly demure Japanese girl in a kimono shop, who actually turns out to be a US Navy Nurse Corps officer of Japanese-American descent, Lieutenant Tomiko Momoyama (Kwan). However, it turns out she was betrothed as a child to a traditional Japanese man named Toshi (Shigeta), who fully intends on enforcing tradition. Willoughby divides his time between trying to return the Buddha statue back to the Japanese village it rightfully belongs to, and trying to woo Tomiko from the traditional Japanese man she rightfully belongs to.
