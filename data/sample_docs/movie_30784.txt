Thamizharasu (Prasanna) wants to become a cop, but the arrogant police officers Inspector Parameshwaran (Manivannan) and AC Gowrishankar (Riyaz Khan) ensure that he does not succeed. Meanwhile, he discovers a plot to assassinate the Governor (Visu) by the terrorist Gulshan Baba (Kazan Khan), and he complains it to Gowrishankar, but discovers that he is also a member of the plot. So he forms a detective agency and starts cracking the plot, and how he succeeds in it with the help of his father (Delhi Ganesh), his father's Friend (Ilavarasu) and, of course, with the Cheenichamy (Vadivelu), forms the rest of the story.
