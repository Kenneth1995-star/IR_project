Daera

The narrative deals with the dreams and aspiration of a 16-old-girl, Sheetal (Meena Kumari), caught in the vortex of uncertainty and morality. She is desperate for engagement with her neighbour, Shravan (Nasir Khan, late brother of Dilip Kumar), who is equally drawn towards her, but she is forced into meaningless wedlock with a sick old man (Nana Palsikar), a man old enough to be her father.
