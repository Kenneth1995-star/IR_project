Kadhal Parisu

The movie starts with Mohan (Kamal) getting released from prison after serving a sentence on a rape charge. Malini (Ambika) and Chitra (Radha) are sisters and heirs to a wealthy business. Malini looks after the business after their parents died while Chitra is a student. Mohan meets Chitra and soon they fall in love while Malini has sworn off all men. Jaishankar is their uncle who is after their wealth.
When Chitra brings Mohan home to meet her sister, Mohan and Malini have a big fight which ends is Malini forbidding Chitra from seeing Mohan. Malini then reveals the reason behind the fight. Years earlier, Mohan and Malini were classmates: Malini had a crush on him which Mohan never reciprocated. While on a class trip, Malini gives a note to Mohan that asks him to meet her in his room. Malini claims that, that night, Mohan entered her room and they had consensual sex, but Mohan denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison.
The truth comes out. During the class trip, Mohan never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj Kumar, who was their classmate. Raj, lusting after Malini, uses this opportunity to enter Malini’s room on the pretext of being Mohan and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Malini didn’t know the difference.
Mohan forgives Malini and gets back with Chitra while the bad guys are punished.
