All at Once

Tim and Dan are loser friends from a provincial town. University life is behind them, they do not wish to work, there are no girls. The guys undertake to fulfill the task of a local bandit and start to work, taking with them a car mechanic Zhora, who is also a total failure. It is necessary for them to clearly stage a robbery of their own, fake drug courier. The role of the courier is accidentally given to the honest demobbed Vanya, son of the local authority â€“ the "Persian", who obeys the local criminal authority, who is not aware of the permutations and promises.
