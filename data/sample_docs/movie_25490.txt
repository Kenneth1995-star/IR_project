Ram (Jeetendra) and Lakshman (Mithun Chakraborty) are two orphan kids who were separated from their parents in childhood. They were brought up by a widowed woman (Chand Usmani) along with her grandson Akbar (Asrani). Ram falls in love with Radha (Madhavi), while Lakshman's sweetheart is Jenny (Bhanupriya). One day, they come across a blind couple (Satyendra Kapoor and Jayshree Gadkar). They recognize them as their long-lost parents who were blinded by a cruel man, Ajit Singh (Amrish Puri). Now Ram and Lakshman decide to seek vengeance, but before they do so, Ajit Singh kills Akbar and kidnaps the entire family. The rest of the story is how Ram and Lakshman protect their family and take revenge against Ajit Singh.
