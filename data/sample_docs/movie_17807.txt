Lake Mungo

Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming with her family at a dam in Ararat, Australia. Following the tragedy, her teenaged brother Matthew sets up video cameras around the house to record what seem to be images of Alice's ghost appearing in the family home. It's discovered that Matthew was actually setting up the "sightings" of his dead sister to give the family reason to exhume her body and give his mother closure. However, upon closer review, one of the hoax videos captures Alice's bedroom being searched by Brett, a neighbor for whom she had worked as a babysitter. After her own search of the bedroom, Alice's mother finds a hidden videotape showing Alice in a sexual encounter with Brett and his wife.
A psychic that the family had contacted earlier, when they thought Matthew's videos were real, admits that Alice had met with him several months before her death and had told him she was having dreams about drowning, being dead and her mother not being able to see or help her. Alice's boyfriend comes forward with cell phone footage showing Alice during a school trip to Lake Mungo, in which she frantically digs into the sand at the base of a tree with her bare hands. Alice's family travels to Lake Mungo and finds the tree, where they dig up her cell phone. The footage on the phone shows her walking down the darkened shoreline of the lake and encountering a corpse-like doppelg√§nger of herself, appearing just as her body had been found in the lake.
Alice's family moves out of their house, feeling that she had simply wanted them to know who she really was and what she had seen. The film's mid-credit scenes reveal that Alice had actually manifested in Matthew's hoax pictures and videos without anybody noticing.
