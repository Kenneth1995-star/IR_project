Boss

The film starts with school teacher Satyakant Shastri (Mithun Chakraborty) who has two children: Surya and Shiv. After Surya brawls with another child multiple times and eventually kills him, Satyakant kicks him out and disowns him. Years later, Shiv (Shiv Pandit) grows up as the only son to his father. It is revealed that, after being disowned, Surya had saved the life of a transport businessman Tauji aka Big Boss (Danny Denzongpa) who had taken him in and raised him like a son for 15 years. Now, Surya (Akshay Kumar) has transformed himself into Boss, a suave, tough transport businessman who fights for justice.
Shiv falls in love with Ankita (Aditi Rao Hydari), who turns out to be the sister of a corrupt police officer named Ayushman Thakur (Ronit Roy). Ayushman is in cahoots with the corrupt and power-hungry Home Minister, Pradhan (Govind Namdeo). Pradhan suggests to Ayushman that he should get Ankita married to his son Vishal (Aakash Dabhade). Ayushman agrees and decides that Ankita will marry him whether she wants to or not. Upon finding out she is in love with Shiv, he has Shiv arrested and convicted for crimes he hasn't committed. It's also revealed that Surya didn't murder his classmate. Instead, Satyakant accidentally impaled him when he shoved them into a room so that they would learn to deal with each other.
Satyakant then tries to bail Shiv out and calmly explains to Ayushman. He is instead is humiliated and thrown out of the police station. Without any choice, Satyakant turns to his other son for help.
