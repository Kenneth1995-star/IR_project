S. P. Parasuram

Parasuram (Chiranjeevi) is a police official who is very rash and is willing to arrest his own family for the sake of the law. Harish Kumar, his brother, is caught in a blue film gang, and Rani (Sridevi), a common thief, almost becomes a victim but manages to escape. Because she is a witness, she is later assaulted and becomes blind. How Parasuram protects her and how the villains try to take revenge on him form the crux of the story.
