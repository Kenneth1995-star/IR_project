Vishal, Reemma Sen, Bharath

Mythili (Reema Sen) showers love and affection on Viswa (Bharath), her neighbor, since childhood. Viswa happens to be the only son of a rich business tycoon Rajasekhar (Girish Karnad), who loses his mother at a young age. Mythili treats Viswa as her younger brother and spends all her time with him. Meanwhile, Ragunandan(Vishal), an income tax officer, turns up at Rajasekhar's house for an IT raid and happens to meet Mythili there. They eventually fall in love and after a series of incidents they get wed locked. They settle in Goa then. The trouble begins when Viswa reaches Goa in search of Mythili. He manages to kidnap Mythili and bring her to Chennai. The reasons for Viswa's obsession and possessiveness towards Mythili unfolds as the movie progresses. Ragunandan who comes back to Goa finds the house deserted. The next door neighbor tells him that Mythili eloped with Viswa. He then begins to track her down and finds that the duo had left to Chennai. Ragunandan reaches Chennai, but is unable to tell his parents the real plight. With the help of Harichandra(Vivek), his colleague, he tries to trace her out. A chance look at the video of their marriage throws light on Viswa’s hatred towards Ragunandan. Now Ragunanthan is convinced that Mythili did not go on her own will. He confronts Viswa’s father but he is of no help. Finally he traces out the location of Viswa’s hideout. Mythili on the other hand pleads with Viswa to release her. She explains that she cannot be his wife and can see him only as a son or a little brother. The plea falls on deaf ears. In a racy climax on high seas, the three protagonists fight it out and Mythili hits Viswa with the boat oars. He plunges into the sea in an unconscious condition taking Mythili along. Ragunanthan comes at the nick of the time to save her. Even though she had killed him because of her attack on him, she is filled with remorse.
