Impulse

Alan Curtis (Kennedy), an American real estate agent living in England, is dissatisfied with his humdrum life. With his wife Elizabeth (Shelton) on a lengthy vacation visiting her mother, he gives a ride to sultry nightclub-singer Lila (Smith) when he finds her stranded on the road. Curtis gets romantically involved with her and Lila tells him that her brother has gotten in trouble over a jewel robbery.
In truth, Lila wants the stolen stones for herself. She tricks the wayward Curtis into believing that he killed a man after he buys them two tickets out of the country. He decides that it is better to face the music, opting to stay and confess. Lila, too, reconsiders, staying with Curtis until his name is cleared. After the true killers are revealed, Lila goes to jail as a participant in the robbery and Curtis returns to his wife, who forgives him.
