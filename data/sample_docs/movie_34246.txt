Rag Union

An ordinary Moscow guy, Vanya, after finishing school, goes to work as a "living advertisement" of monument-tombstones. At the cemetery, he meets three energetic guys - either a section, or a sect that calls itself the "Rag Union". Vanya asks to take him to their training sessions, and they settle for a month at Vanya's dacha.
