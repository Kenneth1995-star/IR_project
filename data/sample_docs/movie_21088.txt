The film is a family comedy[3] chronicling a reluctantly Jewish man (Timothy Spall) who tries to re-unite his dysfunctional family in time for the Jewish celebration of Pesach so as to appease his ailing mother Honor Blackman.[4] Although they are all from the same family his estranged children hardly seem like they are from the same planet. He must reunite his son the capitalist James Callis, his daughter the eco-warrior Rhona Mitra, his son the Buddhist Monk, and his last son, a born again Rabbi.[5]
