Morphine

The film takes place in the early 20th century. A young Russian doctor called Mikhail Polyakov (Leonid Bichevin) arrives at a small hospital in a remote village. Having freshly graduated from medical school, with little experience, he is the only doctor in the rural district. He works hard, earning the respect of his small staff (one paramedic and two nurses).
After an allergic reaction to a diphtheria vaccination, he has his nurse Anna give him morphine to negate the effects. Gradually he slips into addiction.
