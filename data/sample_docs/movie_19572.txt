On the Fiddle

During the Second World War, spiv Horace Pope is taken to court for street peddling. In mitigation he tells the judge he is only working in the black market while waiting to enlist in the war effort. On hearing this plea, the judge calls his bluff and forces him to sign up.
Pope joins the RAF. Very quickly he makes friends with the easy going, but loyal, Pedlar Pascoe who happily goes along with all of his scams, which mainly involve taking money for leave passes and for organising postings close to home. The pair do their utmost to make a bit on the side and avoid being sent into action.
However, their antics soon lead to them being sent on a mission to occupied France where they unexpectedly succeed with their offbeat actions.
