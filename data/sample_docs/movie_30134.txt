Ram Sundar (Sarath Kumar), also known as Ramu, is a rich businessman and he is married to Meenakshi (Meena). They have an arrogant daughter Priya (Meena). Ramesh (Vignesh), a graduate who works as a car driver, falls in love with Priya and lies her to be a rich man. They fall in love with each other until Priya knows the truth. So, Ramu tells their past to his daughter.
In the past, Meenakshi was the daughter of a rich businessman (Kitty) while Ramu repaired slippers in the street with Ponnusamy (Goundamani). One day, Ramu saved Meenakshi from goons and Meenakshi fell in love with him. Ponnusamy and Meenakshi made a plan to seduce Ramu. Under the name of Mayil Aatha, Meenakshi has won Ramu's heart. Meenakshi's father didn't accept for the marriage, so Meenakshi refused her rich life and she got married with Ramu. Ramu worked hard and he became one of the richest man in India.
Priya understands that money is not the only measure of success in life. Soon, Ramu clashes with Krishnamoorthy (Raghuvaran), an influential man.
