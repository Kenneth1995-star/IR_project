Sagaai

Sheel Rajshree and Kailash's Prem Chopra marriage is planned by Sheel's father. But fate takes her into the arms of Rajesh Biswajeet, and they celebrate their engagement on Sheel's birthday. Rajesh meets with a car accident, conspired by Kailash, and is paralyzed waist down. Rai Sahebh refuses to acknowledge their engagement but Sheel adamantly leaves her home to be with the ailing Rajesh and gets married to him by Vedic rituals. She nurses him back to health, but is rudely preyed upon by Kailash, who wants to see the end of Rajesh. The film reflects upon the trails and travails of a woman whose husband is ill and paralyzed and she is desired by another man. A very beautiful dance number is performed by Sheel as Visha Kanya, very much before her life is thrown in such a turmoil.
