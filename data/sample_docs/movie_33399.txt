Abaranger vs. Hurricanger

Scientists believe that 65,000,000 years ago, a meteorite's crash on Earth killed off the dinosaurs, but in truth, it split Earth into two parallel universes: Dino Earth (ダイノアース, Daino Aasu), an Earth where dinosaurs were still the superior species, and our Earth, referred to as Another Earth (アナザーアース, Anazaa Aasu) by the residents of Dino Earth. Overtime, the Dragon People (竜人, Ryujin) and Bakuryū (爆竜) races came into being on Dino Earth but were at war with the Evoliens, entities that emerged from the meteor. The two Earths are separate until Asuka, one of the Dragon People from Dino Earth, arrives on Earth via a transdimensional portal. However, he is followed by the Evoliens in their Anamolicarus spaceship and the three Bakuryū under their control. As the Bakuryū Tyrannosaurus, Ptreranodon, and Triceratops attack Tokyo, a call is sent out to three destined ones who possess Dino Guts (ダイノガッツ, Daino Gattsu) to gain the powers to tame the three beasts. Together with their Bakuryū partners, the three become Abarangers to protect their dimension from the Evoliens. In time another Abaranger appears, but he takes the name "Abare Killer" and fights the others while the Evoliens carry out their ultimate goal: the resurrection of their god.
