Gowtham (Sumanth) is an ad filmmaker and creates an "imaginary model" for one of his ad films. That model happens to be Meenakshi (Vedhika), whose engagement is canceled due to Gowthamâ€™s sleazy ads. Meenakshi comes to Hyderabad from Vizag to take action on that ad agency.
She contacts her close friend Zareen (Sindhu Tolani), who is an investigative journalist to take action against them. Zareen is on a dangerous mission at that time as she wants to expose the facts about a dreadful terrorist attack. Zareen hands over a DVD which contains all the details about the terrorist attack to Meenakshi before she is found out and killed.
Now terrorists are after Meenakshi for that DVD and she is accompanied by Gowtham, who comes to rescue her. Meenakshi and Gowtham have to run away from the terrorists and also stop the planned terror attack. How do they succeed in doing so forms the rest of the story.
