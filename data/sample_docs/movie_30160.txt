Thayagam

Three death row prisoners escape from the jail and hijack a plane where Abdul Salim (Laxmi Rattan), a scientist, owns a miracle drug. The pilot (Napoleon), instead of listening the hijackers, manages to land in a Kashmir mountain. There, Snobir (Mansoor Ali Khan), a sadistic terrorist leader threatens the passengers for recovering the drugs.
