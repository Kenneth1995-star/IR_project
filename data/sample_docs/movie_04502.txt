The Late George Apley

George Apley (Ronald Colman) is a stuffy, self-satisfied member of Boston's upper class, supremely confident of the superiority of his hometown. However, his comfortable, predictable world is overturned when he learns, to his horror, that both his son and his daughter have fallen in love with non-Bostonians. However, he is eventually brought around to see reason.
Despite the film's title, unlike the book and play, George Apley does not die in the film.[3]
