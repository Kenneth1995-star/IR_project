Pandippada

Pandippada is the story of a rivalry between Pandi Durai (Prakash Raj) and his brother-in-law Karuppayya Swami who are landlords that brutally rule villages. Bhuvana Chandran (Dileep) is a 25-year-old man who gets a piece of land in the same village. He has a lot of debts and in order to clear that, he has to sell this land. But Pandi Durai and Karuppayya will not allow him to sell the land.
Bhuvana chandran comes to this village to check the possibilities of selling the land. Then he sees his best friend Bhasi (Harisree Ashokan) who lived there and asks for his help. Bhasi takes him to Pandi Durai whose gang he was a member of and Bhuvana joins Pandi's group. Later he falls in love with Meena (Navya Nair) who is the daughter of Karuppayya Swami.[4] [5]
But Pandi Durai also wants to marry Meena and this makes Pandi and Bhuvana as enemies. Pandi wants to kill Bhuvana. Karuppayya fixes the marriage of Meena and Bhuvana. Pandi also fixes his marriage with Meena on the same date. In the fight that follows, Bhuvana beats up Pandi and finally gives a gun to him and asks him to shoot him if he cannot see him as a brother. Pandi realises his mistakes and forgives them both and attends their marriage.
