Pudhaiyal

Pudhayal was about imaginary gold buried on a beach, which Vellaiambalam (Balaiah) covets. Padmini and Sivaji meet and talk about how her father (M.K. Radha) in Sri Lanka was implicated in her mother’s murder and imprisoned.
Padmini and her sister Thangam come to India, where the sister dies. It’s believed that she drowned and her body lies under the sand. Vellaiambalam overhears the word ‘Thangam’ (‘gold’ in Tamil) and believes a fortune is buried there.
