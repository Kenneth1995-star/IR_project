Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter

The plot revolves about the rivalry between a female gang (the Alleycats led by Mako) and the men of the Eagle gang run by Baron. When a member of the Alleycats turns down an advance from one of the Eagles (Susumu) in favor of her half-black boyfriend, the Eagle leader Baron, whose sister had been raped by a mixed-race individual, moves to rid the town of its racially mixed population. More problems ensue when a mixed-race stranger (Kazuma) finds favor with the Alleycats' leader Mako. The questions of race relations and nationality were especially pertinent since the film was shot near the U. S. Naval base at Yokosuka.[4]
