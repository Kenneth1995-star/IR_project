Praanam

Then there was a village in coastal area. Sivudu (Allari Naresh) 26 belongs to lower caste and Katyayani (Sadha) 23 is a chaste Brahmin. When the village head 50 (also Sadha's strict barhmin father) played by Mantripragada Venkat Rao comes to know that they fell in love, he decides to hang them off because inter-caste love/marriage is a sin as per their village laws. These two souls take a rebirth. Kathyayani is born as Uma 21, a sister of powerful politician (Benerjee)39. Sivudu is born as Kaasi 23, a NRI orphan who returns from USA (Los Angeles, California) to do a Telugu music video album. He is in search of a pristine Telugu girl and he finds Uma. They fall in love, but her politician brother wants her to get married to his nephew(Shafi) (also known as his brother-in-law's son) 22. Uma and Kaasi run away from Vizag city to coastal area and incidentally they land in a place where Kathyayani and Sivudu lived. The village men identify them. The rest of the film is all about how all ends well.
