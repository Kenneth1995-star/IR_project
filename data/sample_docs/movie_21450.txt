Downhill

At his kitchen table, in front of his teenage son Luke (Rupert Simonian) and his hand-held camera, Gordon (Richard Lumsden) explains the mission – to walk Alfred Wainwright’s epic Coast-to-Coast Walk – starting at St Bees and finishing 192 miles on at Robin Hood's Bay. As he discusses the gruelling hike he is about to attempt, his wife jests that it’s, "just an excuse for a massive piss up!"
After consulting his maps, Gordon rounds up the mismatched troop. A team which consists of best friend Keith (Karl Theobald), who hopes this trail of discovery can help him alleviate his burdened mind, and old school friends Steve (Jeremy Swift), a physically under-prepared school teacher, and Julian (Ned Dennehy), the troublesome and troubled wild-card.
As the journey unfolds and the alcohol flows, we discover not only why this incompatible bunch have not caught up for decades, but also about the trials and tribulations of entering the mid-life – whether it be money problems, hidden secrets, loss of identity, addiction or just general disillusionment.
Julian’s rebellious side continues to mock and thwart even the best of Gordon’s meticulous plans, as they battle not only their personal crises and hangovers but also the seemingly unattainable journey and the struggle to sustain their frayed friendship.
When the group crosses paths with two attractive, younger female travellers, who are attempting the same walk, another challenge is set and their friendship is seemingly pushed to the point of no return.
During the journey, each character indulges in a cathartic release in an attempt to unburden themselves from their own demons. We come to realise, this journey is not only important for the original instigators, Keith and Gordon, but it bears a unique significance to each of the foursome.
