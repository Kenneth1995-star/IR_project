Bayonetta: Bloody Fate

As an adaption of Bayonetta rather than a direct translation, Bloody Fate's storyline follows the events and characters of the game with some slight changes to locales and specific order and details. After waking from 500 years of slumber at the bottom of a lake with no memory of her life before, the witch Bayonetta embarks on a journey to rediscover her identity and her past. Battling the hordes of angels that stand in her way, Bayonetta's journey takes her to the isolated European town of Vigrid where she is confronted by faces from her past and a mystery regarding the Eyes of the World.
