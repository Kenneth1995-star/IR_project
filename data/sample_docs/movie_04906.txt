Hellfire

Drifting gambler Zeb Smith promises a dying preacher who saved his life that he'll fulfill the preacher's lifelong goal to build a church.
He needs money and there's a $5,000 reward out for lady outlaw Doll Brown, who has murdered Lew Stoner, her husband. Stoner's brothers Gyp, Red and Dusty are after her as well, as is Zeb's law-abiding pal, Marshal Bucky McLean.
Doll mocks his newfound faith and knocks Zeb unconscious after their first meeting. She rides to Cheyenne to look for her little sister, Jane Carson. The sheriff there, Duffy, tries to arrest Doll, and soon Bucky rides into town, too.
On the run, Zeb and Doll hide out in a cabin. By the time Bucky rides up, Doll's changed her whole look and he doesn't recognize her. Bucky confides to Zeb that he is married to Jane and would like to see Doll dead so no one will ever know Jane's dark family secret, that her sister is a notorious outlaw.
After being captured and roughed up by the Stoner boys, an angry Zeb is deputized by Duffy and goes after them. He arrests Doll, but in jail she gets the drop on him, locking him up. Doll is shot twice by the Stoners, who are about to shoot her again when Zeb manages to do away with all three. In his arms, Doll finally comes to appreciate Zeb's faith in God.
