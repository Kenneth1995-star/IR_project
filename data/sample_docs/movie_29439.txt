Penn Deivam

Padmini plays the role of a sacrificing mother. Her husband (Sundarrajan) is a goon, gambler and smoker, with the son (Master Prabhakar, later. R. Muthuraman) taking after those vices. The mother’s attempts to correct him are in vain.
When she begets a daughter, her husband gets upset, and in a fit of rage, abandons the baby in an orphanage. In the meantime, a rich man (Raghavan), whose wife slips into a coma after delivering a still-born female child, comes to the orphanage, looking for a daughter. He takes Padmini’s baby and gives it to his wife, who passes away soon after. By sheer coincidence, Padmini, who is forced to leave the house, is hit by this rich man’s car as he leaves the orphanage.
The mother recognises the child after seeing her birthmark and asks the rich man if he will let her babysit the child. The rich man gets her to promise that she will never reveal the truth about the child’s parentage.
The child grows into a lovely young woman (Lakshmi), who falls in love with a police officer (Jaishankar). The police officer, who observes Lakshmi and Padmini, gets the impression that she is more than just a maid. After many twists, the truth emerges. Lakshmi goes on to marry the police officer at the end.
