Navajo Kid

Tom Kirk, the "Navajo Kid", (Bob Steele) is determined to find his adoptive father's (George Morrel) murderer. When he finds Honest John Grogan (I. Stanford Jolly) with his father's ring, he immediately arrests him. While Honest John was indeed part of the gang which killed Joe Kirk, the gang-leader was Matt Crandall (Stanley Blystone). As Tom begins hunting for Matt, he soon discovers who his true biological father is.
