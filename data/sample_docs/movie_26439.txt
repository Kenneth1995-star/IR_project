Ek Chalis Ki Last Local

The story revolves around two people who miss the last local train at 1:40 am and how it changes the course of their lives forever. The protagonist Nilesh (Abhay Deol) works in a call centre firm cultivated by the IT industry. Night shifts, booze, after office parties seem to be the order of the day. When Nilesh misses his last train from Kurla to Vikroli, he is rudely shoved off by a police constable who wants to keep the station clean from anti-social elements. Nowhere to go, he strolls outside for an auto-rickshaw, where he bumps into a beautiful damsel in distress, Madhu (Neha Dhupia), also wanting a ride to Vikhroli. As it turns out, the rickshaws are on strike due to a bomb blast earlier in the day at Ghatkopar. Nilesh and Madhu are forced to walk to the next rickshaw stand.
Nilesh stops by a local pub and is unable to resist his temptation to have a drink or two. He meets an old friend, Pat, who appears to have amassed a lot of money within a year through gambling. Knowing his expertise with the cards, Pat invites Nilesh to join him in the inner chambers to play with the high rollers. Upon some persuasion from Madhu, he gives in and gambles. Taking over Nilesh's turn, Pat loses all the money they have won to an underworld don. In the meantime, in his search for Madhu, Nilesh stumbles into the restroom where he finds Madhu apparently being forced upon by a local goon. He later learns that she was just plying her trade. A police encounter specialist, a religious but notorious south Indian don, a gay underworld don and the Mumbai red light underbelly too get involved. Starting the adventure with just Rs. 70 in his pocket, when he catches the first morning train home 2-Â½ hours later, he has Rs. 2.5 crores in his hands. How Nilesh lands up with this bounty and the girl by missing his train sums up this comic thriller.
