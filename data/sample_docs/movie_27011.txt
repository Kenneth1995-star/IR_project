Raja Natwarlal

Raja (Emraan Hashmi) is a small-time conman who cons people for a living along with his partner in crime Raghav (Deepak Tijori). He is in love with a bar girl Ziya (Humaima Malick). Feeling sorry for her, Raja decides he wants to go for a big catch so that he can marry his lady love and she won't have to work in a bar anymore. That's when the trouble starts. Along with Raghav, Raja makes a grand plan to swindle a huge amount of money from two baddies. The plan is successful and Raja decides to celebrate.
This is when Varda Yadav (Kay Kay Menon), a billionaire based in Cape Town, enters. The money actually belonged to him and upon realizing it has been stolen by two street-cons Varda orders them to be killed. Varda's men find Raghav and kill him. Raja witnesses this and decides to avenge the loss.
He seeks the help of a seasoned crook Yogi (Paresh Rawal), whom Raghav used to talk about before his murder. After a lot of persuasion, Yogi agrees to help Raja have his payback. Later is revealed that Yogi is actually Raghav's older brother. Yogi trains him, and eventually they form a team of crooks, and set out to Cape Town to finish off Varda where he took his revenge.
