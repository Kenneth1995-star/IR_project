Parudeesa (പറുദീസ)

Parudeesa tells the story of a Catholic parish in a hillside village in Kerala. Set in two milieus – Kerala of the sixties and seventies and that of the eighties and nineties – the film unfolds through the conflict of ideals between Bishop Aanjalithanam (Sreenivasan), an orthodox Bishop, who is the last word in the parish, and a firebrand Priest named Jose (Thampy Antony), who believes that Christ was the original revolutionary. Both of them believe that their way to God is the true path, the only path.
As he sets out to bring a change in society, increasingly Father Jose finds himself facing opposition at every turn, and that's not only from Bishop Aanjalithanam but from within the parish and the extended village community too. The catalyst for the conflict is feisty Theresia (Swetha Menon), an umarried maid who works in the kitchen of a nearby convent. Jagathy Sreekumar also has an important role in the film, as the powerful secretary of the church committee.[1]
