T D Dasan Std VI B

T. D. Dasan (Master Alexander) is a young boy who lives with his mother (Shwetha Menon). His father had left them years back when Dasan was one year old. Dasan gets his dad's address from his mother's old trunk box and writes him a letter.
Dasan's father had moved out of that address and the letter reaches the current resident Nandakumar Poduval (Biju Menon), an Ad film maker who lives with his thirteen-year-old daughter Ammu (Tina Rose) at Bangalore. Nandan requests Ammu's caretaker Madhavan (Jagadish) to find out the whereabouts of the person and deliver the letter to him. But Madhavan is not that enthusiastic and the letter ends up in the waste bin. Ammu sees this and feels bad about it. She starts writing replies to Dasan, as if they were written to him by his dad. The young boy is excited at the thought of having found his dad, and shares all his feelings and needs with his dad. Ammu promptly replies with pens and other gifts Dasan asked his father.
Later Dasan's mother gets to know this and gets shattered by this news. Nandakumar also gets to know this news and becomes furious at his daughter, revealing that Dasan's father had actually died months ago while suffering from jaundice. He now wants to meet Dasan, apologize and tell him the truth. Dasan's mother was later found dead under mysterious circumstances. When Nandakumar comes to meet Dasan, he understands that Dasan is now an orphan, who was now under the care of his uncle Raman Kutty. Dasan meets Nandakumar, who now sees him as his father. Nandakumar first thinks of leaving the place without Dasan but changes his mind soon after.
