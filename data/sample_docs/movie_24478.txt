In pursuit of Shyam and to recover the necklace, it's Pran to the rescue. What follows is a song-filled caper of intrigue, adventure and romance, all set in one eventful night. Laaj is helped by Pran, first on the railway track, then when Laaj is depressed, she tries to commit suicide by jumping into the sea. a brief interlude with the taxi drivers, who put themselves on the track of Shyam, and with twists and turns the necklace is retrieved, and Laaj reaches home in time before her father wakes up and notices her absence. Young Laaj is wiser by the events of the night and realises that her Beau was only interested in her wealth. She agrees to go with her Father to send him off at the airport and also to meet up there with her Father's friend and his son, to whom her father would like her to get married.
A rather subdued Laaj is waiting at the airport with her Father, when he notices his friend and his son coming up to meet them, and he tells Laaj "there is the boy I want you to marry, I like him a lot, but I want you to see him and decide". Laaj looks up towards the person her father pointed out, and suddenly she breaks out into a smile. Life is worth living after all.
