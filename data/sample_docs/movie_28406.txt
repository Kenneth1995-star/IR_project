Harikrishnan (Fahadh Faasil) is a geeky software architect who suffers from Obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality disorder. His colleagues find it hard to work with him due to his emotional outbursts and odd mannerisms, though the company leadership values him as a core asset to the organization. His colleagues hatch a plan to send him off to Trivandrum to demonstrate on a webinar, one of company's top selling products, which also happens to be developed by Hari. Unfortunately for him, the date of his journey coincides with a harthal day. En route to Trivandrum, in the middle of the night, his co-passenger Gopalan (Nedumudi Venu), a veteran politician, receives a call informing him that his wife is seriously ill. As soon as the train leaves Kollam, Gopalan, growing concerned about his wife's health decides to change his plan and return to his hometown in Kozhikode to attend to his ailing wife. Seeing the situation, another passenger Narayani a.k.a. Nani (Swathi Reddy), a social worker, decides to join Gopalan. They get down at Paravur railway station. In the confusion to get down at Paravur, Gopalan accidentally drops his cell phone on the train before disembarking. Hari notices the ringing phone when Gopalan's friend Moidheen calls him up to inform about his wife's death. Hari picks the call and hears the sad news. Not knowing how to react in this situation, Hari also gets down at Paravur in the pretext of forgetting his bag on the train. Hari decides to follow Narayani and Gopalan on their return journey to Kozhikode. The plan not only upsets his daily routine and schedule, but also disturbs his standard of hygiene. Nani on the other hand is carefree and unlike Hari, goes out of her way to help others. The journey becomes a learning experience for Hari and how he understands and overcomes various trying situations in life. The films ends with Hari and Nani falling in love and him finally overcoming his OCPD.
