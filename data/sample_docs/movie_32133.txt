Vamsy (Aryan Rajesh), Nandu (Namitha) and Bose (Rohit) are childhood friends. Vamsy and Nandu grew up very close. Bose falls in love with a beautiful girl named Sowmya. When Bose tells Vamsy about her, she deems it one more love affair that is bound to fail. Vamsy feels that friendship is more valuable than love and that love spoils a friendship. Nandu, who wanted to share her love, goes back to the shelter as she feels Vamsy might get offended.
Vamsy leaves for New Zealand to supervise the overseas operations of his father's company. In New Zealand, Vamsy realizes that he is in love with Nandu. When Vamsy returns to India, he finds out that Nandu is already engaged to someone else(Advi Sesh). Just before her marriage, Nandu receives a bouquet from Vamsy's friend addressing both Vamsy and Nandu. Realizing that Vamsy loves her, Nandu runs after him at the Airport.
