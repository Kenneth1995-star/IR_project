Pillaiyar Theru Kadaisi Veedu

Ganesan aka Ganesh (Jithan Ramesh) is a happy-go-lucky youth in a village. A great admirer of actor-director T. Rajendar, Ganesh spends all his time with his friends, such as Soori and a few others. This is ridiculed by his father (Jayaprakash).
Ganesh's life takes a turn when he comes across Sandhya (Sanchita Padukone). She is a friend of Ganesh's sister who comes on a vacation to the village. He admires her beauty and falls flat for her. When Ganesh gathers guts to open his heart to Sandhya, enters Valli (Suhasini), Ganesh's uncle's (Ilavarasu) daughter.
Fearing that her father will get her married to a local goon Durai (Bose Venkat), she decides to marry Ganesh. Suddenly Sandhya falls ill and Ganesh takes her to the hospital. He is shocked when the doctor (Prakash Raj) informs that she has final-stage pancreatic cancer, and that she will die in a few months.
Ganesh, in a bid to keep her happy until her death, marries her and comes home. As a result, he incurs the wrath of his father and is driven out of the house. However, a sudden twist in the plot causes the movie to end on an emotional note.
