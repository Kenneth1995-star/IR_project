Almost a Gentleman

After his new wife's family convinces her to leave him, attorney Dan Preston leaves his law practice and sets off to travel around the country as a vagabond. When he returns home he finds his house rented by a novelist, Shirley Haddon. He adopts a mongrel dog, Picardy Max, and sets out to avenge himself against his ex-wife's family by entering Max into dog shows to compete against their pedigreed animals. Preston also begins a romantic relationship with Haddon.
Robert Mabrey, Preston's ex-brother-in-law, takes great stock in his dog winning the competition, and when he learns that Max is quite impressive in his training, he begins to get a bit concerned. When a local bully is killed by a wild animal, Mabrey sees an opportunity to rid himself of the competition, and blames the attack on Max. Faced with the impending execution of the dog, Preston resumes his legal robes and defends the dog in court. During the hearing it is discovered that the man was killed by an escaped wildcat from a visiting circus, and Max is vindicated.
When Marian Mabrey, Preston's ex-wife, is kidnapped, Max tracks the culprits down and she is saved by Preston and Max. Preston and Robert Mabrey reconcile, and Preston and Haddon begin a life together.
