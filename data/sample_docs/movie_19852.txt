The Trygon Factor

A Scotland Yard inspector is called to investigate a series of unsolved robberies. Inspector Cooper-Smith (Stewart Granger) arrives at the country manor of a respectable English family. He discovers Livia Emberday (Cathleen Nesbitt), the mistress of the house, has turned to crime in order to bolster the family's flagging fortunes. With assistance from an order of bogus nuns, stolen goods end up in the warehouse of Hamlyn (Robert Morley), purportedly a respectable businessman.[3]
