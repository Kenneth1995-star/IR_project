 Love of My Life

The film follows Julius, a man who mysteriously wakes up strapped to a hospital bed and is given the choice by what seems to be a deranged surgeon to either survive 5 days of torture, or say "I quit" and have the love of his life killed. The film follows Julius's fight for survival and the early stages of his relationship through a series of flash backs. The flashbacks then start becoming more intense and filter into his real world.
The film was shot completely in Sydney, Bathurst and Orange, NSW, Australia.
