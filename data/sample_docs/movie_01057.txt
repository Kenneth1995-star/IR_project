The story depicts Hamilton's (George Arliss) efforts to pass the "Assumption Bill", which required the federal government to assume the debts incurred by the 13 states during the American Revolutionary War, and his agreement to a compromise by passage of the Residence Bill establishing the national capital.[2]
