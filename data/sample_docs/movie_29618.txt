Keezh Vaanam Sivakkum

Dr. Dwarakanath (Sivaji Ganesan) is a renowned ophthalmologist in Coimbatore, devoted to God and with a high moral standing. He shares his happy home with his son Srivathsan (Sarath Babu), daughter-in-law Manju (Saritha), a couple of relatives and a faithful servant (played by Manorama). Dwarakanath's peaceful life is shattered by a double whammy, first when he discovers that Manju is afflicted with a dreadful disease and has only a few months to live and then a blind man Kumaran (Jaishankar) who is seeking revenge against an unknown perpetrator responsible for his sister's suicide, shows up at his doors and Dwarakanath realizes the culprit is none other than his son Srivathsan. Dwarakanath tries to keep his son's culpability under wraps for Manju's sake considering her impending demise but Manju who is ignorant of her own ailment, misconstrues Dwarakanath's intentions and tries to unmask the culprit's identity and it soon turns out to be an intricate cat and mouse game between them both.
