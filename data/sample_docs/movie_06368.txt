Paris Follies of 1956

Dan Bradley owns and operates a Hollywood, California nightclub and is in love with Ruth Harmon, a stage designer for his shows. Dan's a happy man because talented singer Margaret Walton is his headliner and wealthy Alfred Gaylord his financial backer.
Then things go wrong. Margaret, jealous of Ruth, threatens to quit if Dan pays attention to anyone except her. Gaylord's son shows up to take Alfred back to a sanitarium, revealing his father to be irresponsible, not rich.
Margaret's sister, cigarette girl Barbara, manages to persuade Dan's close pal Chuck Russell to audition her to be her sister's understudy. Her timing is good because Margaret gets angry at Dan and does indeed walk off. Barbara, however, gets stage fright and can't go on, resulting in big sister Margaret coming full circle to be the understudy's understudy. She sings and is a great success.
