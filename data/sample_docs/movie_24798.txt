Do Boond Pani

Ganga Singh (Jalal Agha), newly married to Gauri (Simi Garewal), brings his wife to his village where he lives with his father Hari Singh (Sajjan), and sister Sonki (Madhu Chanda). The village is suffering from drought and villagers have to travel a long distance to get water. Ganga Singh hears of a dam being constructed and leaves his wife to join in the building of it. His family goes through misfortunes, with his father dying and his sister being raped by the dacoit Mangal Singh. Ganga himself dies preventing a disaster at the dam. The dam is eventually built bringing greenery to an arid region. His wife bears a son and lives on in the village.
