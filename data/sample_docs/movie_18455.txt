Storm in a Teacup

A Scottish town's powerful provost (mayor) struts and brags about his city "improvements", while the cowed villagers are sullenly forced to put up with him. A free-spirited English reporter (Rex Harrison) is brought from London to work for the local newspaper and soon clashes with the autocrat - while falling in love with his daughter (Vivien Leigh). He strikes out against the Provost by taking up the cause of a poor woman who sells ice cream from a pushcart, and who has dared to protest against the mayor's new "dog tax". Her sheep dog, Patsy, is about to be put to death by the local police because she cannot pay the back taxes (and subsequent fine) incurred by her ownership of the dog.
When the idealistic young reporter exposes the injustice being done to her in the local newspaper (before the editors have a chance to suppress the article), it sparks an indignant protest campaign all over England and Scotland. The furious mayor rashly sues the "cheeky little rotter from London" for libel. A courtroom scene ensues which strongly resembles a "kangaroo trial" until, in view of local support for the defendant (with the villagers humorously barking like dogs) and the budding love affair between the reporter and the mayor's daughter, the mayor gives up, and all is happily resolved.
