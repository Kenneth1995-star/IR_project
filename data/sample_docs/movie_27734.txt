Cover Story

Jasmine Khan (Tabu) is the next door neighbour of Chandrashekar (Nedumudi Venu), a retired judge with a haunted past. The two become friends. Jasmine, a computer engineer, has to wear high power contact lenses because of her vision problems. She meets Vijay, a news reporter and the executive director of True Vision. Chandrashekar is killed by a mysterious man, who is seen but not recognised by Jasmine, as she was not wearing contact lenses at that time. A policeman Anand thinks that Jasmine is the killer. The search for the real killer, and the police attempting to catch him, forms the rest of the story.[2]
