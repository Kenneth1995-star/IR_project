Sawan Ko Aane Do

The movie captures the very heart of rural India. The story is quite simple like most Rajshri production movies. The plot starts off with Chandramukhi, the city educated daughter of the village zamindar arriving at Ramnagar, a typical village. There, she meets her childhood friend Birju, aka Brij Mohan. He has a lovely voice and she encourages him to pursue singing. His brothers love him very much and he is often excused for not working, but his sisters in law hate him for it. He has a young niece who likes him a lot. Eventually, Brij and Chandramukhi fall in love. But Chandramukhi's father cuts it abruptly and sends her to Lucknow. A short while later, Brij arrives at Lucknow. Gitanjali, who happens to be Chandramukhi's friend is thrilled by his voice and helps him get a job at Aakashvani through her father. Brij returns to Ramnagar to ask Chandramukhi's hand in marriage, but is once again rebuked. By this time, her family has lost its wealth in a court case and she becomes a teacher at the local school. He returns and goes on to become a great singer in Mumbai with Gita by his side. Always, he yearns for Chandra as she yearns for him. How he manages to marry her forms the rest of the story.
