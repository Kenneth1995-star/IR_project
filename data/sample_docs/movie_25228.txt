Shaukeen

Shaukeen has 3 lecherous old men (played by Ashok Kumar, Utpal Dutt and A.K. Hangal) who decide to go away for a while to have some enjoyment late in their lives. They hire a driver Ravi (Mithun Chakraborty), a friend of the son of Choudhuri (Ashok Kumar), who takes the name Sakharam. He ends up convincing them to go to Goa where he has his lover, who works as a singer/dancer at a local club. While in Goa, the three old men get in hilarious situations with Anita (Rati Agnihotri) as they try to impress her and try to get lucky with her, oblivious to the fact that she is their driver's love interest.
