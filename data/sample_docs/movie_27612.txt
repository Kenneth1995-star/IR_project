Utsava Melam

Thekumpuram and Vadakumpuram are rival families in the village, and the focal point for their clashes is who has the right over the village temple and its festivals. It is apparent that there is no near resolution of the conflict as well as no room for negotiation between them. However the annual festival in the village must go on and every year and it renews the confrontation between these two families and their supporters which apparently divided the village dangerously between two rivaling factions. The rights for the yearâ€™s festival go to Vadakumpuram family in a negotiation proposed by respected "Thirumeni" of the village.
