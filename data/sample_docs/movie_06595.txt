Magnificent Roughnecks

Under contract with an oil company, engineer Bix Decker and geologist Frank Sommers have been working in South America, but now Bix intends to go home. He changes his mind when replacement Jane Rivers shows up, at first skeptical because she's a woman, then eager to work together.
A rival oil rigger, Werner Jackson, enjoys taunting Bix about a woman doing his job and punches Frank when he tries to intervene. Bix is impressed by Jane's work, but when he tries to kiss her, he gets slapped. His girlfriend Julie also is upset at seeing them together.
During an emergency, after a casing fails, Bix and Frank try to drive nitroglycerine to the well to blow it up and extinguish the fire. Werner blocks the way, but Bix uses a bulldozer to cover him in dirt. A gusher erupts, dousing the blaze. It's time for Bix to return home, but his contract is extended six more months so he can stay behind and work with Jane.
