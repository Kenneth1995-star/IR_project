Kaamannana Makkalu

Kamanna (Doddanna) is a thief who has two children: Krishna (Rockline Venkatesh) and Rama (Sudeep). Years go by and the two, Krishna and Rama, decide to stop stealing and mend their ways and lead a hardworking life along with their father. They migrate to neighboring village and meet a retired agricultural officer, Shivaramanna (Ramesh Bhat) who is in deep debt and is under pressure from the village's landlord, Patela (O.A.K. Sundar) to clear his debts. In efforts to help Shivaramanna, Rama confronts Gayatri (Deepu), Patela's daughter, who comes to collect the money Shivaramanna owes her father. Gayatri starts to acquire a liking for Rama but keeps it hidden due to her father's atrocious temper. In an attempt to teach Patela a lesson, Rama forcibly ties the mangalsutram around Gayatri's neck. Patela, realizing his daughter's love for Rama, comes down to arrange a grand remarriage between the two. But things go awry when Neelakanta (Adi Lokesh), Gayatri's maternal uncle, comes to town in an effort to stop the wedding between the two as he has plans of marrying her and wiping her family fortune.
