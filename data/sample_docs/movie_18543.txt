Bulldog Sees It Through

This is not a Bulldog Drummond picture despite the title playing off Jack Buchanan and his previous association with the character. Here he plays the role of Test Pilot 'Bulldog' Bill Watson. His friend Derek Sinclair (Sebastian Shaw) is convinced that the new man in his love's life is collaborating with the Nazis by sabotaging an armaments plant.[4]
