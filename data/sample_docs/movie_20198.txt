The Best Pair of Legs in the Business

Sherry Sheridan's career is dying. He is tolerated rather than valued at the holiday camp. His wife Mary is having an affair with the outgoing camp manager who tries to persuade her to leave with him. Every time she is about to, something happens to prevent it.
Sherry's agent drops him. He drinks too heavily. The only people who show him any form of affection are two girls who prefer him to two randy boys.
His estranged son Alan turns up in an attempt to heal relations. He invites his father to meet his fiancee and her parents including the father who is a vicar. Sherry attempts to puff himself up as a big shot entertainer who knows the Queen. Having disgraced himself, he goes back to the holiday camp alone.
The two jilted boys find Sherry peeping into the caravan window of the two girls while undressing. They throw him in the swimming pool where he protests that he cannot swim. He is rescued by his son. In a final reconciliation scene, the son explains that the critical comment about having the best legs in the business was actually a compliment after a friend protested that he was embarrassed by his own father's legs in a knobbly knee competition.
