Adutha Varisu

Rajinikanth plays the role of Kannan, a small-time bounty hunter who is enlisted by the crooked members of a royal zameen to find a girl to impersonate the lost heiress to the throne, so that they can usurp the zameen's wealth. Kannan comes across nomadic girl Valli (Sridevi) and trains her to act appropriately and introduces her as the lost heiress to the zameen's head, Rani Amma Rajalakshmi, who is the grandmother of the lost heiress. However, when he learns from Valli's adopted parents that Valli is truly the lost heiress, he sets out to protect her and Rani Amma from the crooked clan.
