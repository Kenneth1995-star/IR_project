Off Track

Joe (Max Mok) is a car fanatic and co-owns an auto repair shop. One time in an illegal street race, Joe collides with Lui (Jacky Cheung) and the two of them were arrested. Since then, Lui and Joe had become enemies. Lui's father (Wu Ma) is a seasoned police officer who goes by his principles and detains his own son, and thus, their relationship had grown very sour, and Lui also increases his hatred towards Joe.. On the other hand, Joe meets Ann (Loletta Lee) and falls in love her. However, Joe discovers that Ann is actually Lui's younger sister, and Lui tries to destroy their relationship. At first, Joe resisted Lui for the sake of Ann, but Lui becomes increasingly aggressive. Knowing that this all started because of her, Ann reluctantly breaks up with Joe. However, Joe refuses to step and negotiates with Lui to settle in a car race with a bet of HK$500,000. During the race, Lui dashes into the ocean. Lui's underling, Bull (Karel Wong), who thinks that Lui is dead, takes Ann hostage to threaten Joe in order to avenge his boss. Joe rushes to save Ann, but was no match for Bull. In this critical occasion, Lui returns with a full body of blood.
