Nai Umar Ki Nai Fasal

This is a story of a student, who in the prime of his career, gets ruffled up, become impulsive and is inclined to go against the discipline of the University. He and his enthusiastic friends are led away and misguided by an outside agency for personal motives. This is opposed by the Heroe's own fiance - college girl in the same University, along with other supporters including his own brother. But before the realization dawns on the students, harm to the prestige of the community and harm to the family was done. Ultimately, it is realized that patriotism is not politics and the students can be patriotic and help the Mother Land in one and thousand ways without being politicians themselves, so long they are pursuing their studies. After having completed their studies, their whole life is before them. If this film is appreciated in its true perspective by the students and their parents it has served its purpose. (Extract from the statement of the Prime Minister of India Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri delivered in Allahabd and published in The Times of India dated 18th Dec 1965).
