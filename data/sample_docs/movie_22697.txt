A Chilling Cosplay

During a period of time, two cases of murder occurred in the community. The victims include a young woman, whose corpse is said to have been frozen by the murderer using a special technique and being dressed up in a costume afterwards before being discarded like a mere doll. Police Captain Fang Youwei (Simon Yam) and his partner Yan Xiaotong (Ying Er), alongside newly recruited officer Xiao Kai (Yuan Hong) investigate this case. They find out that the two victims were college classmates ten years ago, and also stayed in the same cosplay club. Fang approaches Zhou Jin (Vivian Hsu), who was classmates with the two victims. The appearance of Zhou lends the case a new direction and she seems to be the next target of the murderer.
The murderer hides in the shadow sharpening his blade, grinning in his hatred towards the 3 women. He has waited years to seek merciless revenge. In the era of moral turpitude, everything is fearless, life is worthless.
