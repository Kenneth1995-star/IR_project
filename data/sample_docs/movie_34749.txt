A Violent Prosecutor

Byun Jae-Wook (Hwang Jung-min) is a short-tempered prosecutor who only pursues the truth. He is notorious for his rough and tough investigations. A suspect who is a small-time criminal, under the interrogation of Byun Jae-Wook, is then found dead. All the evidence indicate Byun Jae-Wook as the criminal. Byun Jae-Wook is prosecuted and gets 15 years in prison.
At first he is ill-treated by the prisoners. He helps some guards to avoid court room fees and in other legal matters. This gains him a special position in prison. He helps out both the officers and prisoners who are in jail through his legal knowledge and experiences. This makes prisoners loyal to him and he treats them well whenever he receives gifts from the guards. People in jail call him “Sir Young Gam” which means clever person.
Five years later, Byun Jae-Wook meets young fraudster Chi-Won (Gang Dong-won), in prison. Chi-Won knows details about Byun Jae-Wook’s case. Byun Jae-Wook trains Chi-Won to carry out his plan outside of prison. Using his knowledge as a former prosecutor, he gets Chi-Won free. Byun Jae-Wook prepares a counterattack on those who framed him. Although Chi-Won takes the chance to get away from Byun Jae-Wook, the other prisoners whom Byun Jae-Wook has helped get an early release don't let Chi-Won get away. Byun Jae-Wook and Chi-Won get together and start planning against Jong-Gil (Lee Sung-min) who was the Asst. Prosecutor General during Byun Jae-Wook's trial period and the person who had convinced Byun Jae-Wook to defend himself in a self-defense manner which resulted in his jail time. It is revealed that Jong-Gil, who is running in an upcoming election now, then was working with a builder to encroach an ecologically significant land. The rest of the film follows how Byun Jae-Wook through Chi-Won piles up evidences against Jong-Gil and gains his freedom.
