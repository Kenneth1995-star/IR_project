Aa Naluguru

The film starts with two messengers of god (Chalapathi Rao, and Raghubabu) coming to take the life of Raghuram (Rajendra Prasad). He is a kind-hearted idealistic individual who spends half of his income on charity work. He works as the editor of a news paper. When his managing director asks him to publish tabloid photos to increase circulation, he is ready to resign and sell Papads instead of losing his values. Later he realizes his mistake and reappoints Raghuram as the editor and promises him not to involve in his duty.
His wife Bharati (Aamani), two sons Shekar (Raja) & Chinna (Ping Pong Surya) and a daughter Revathi are quite against his helping attitude. His children compel him to get money for their career (bribe for a job), education (donation fee for engineering seat) and settling in the United States which he feels is completely wrong. He is forced to set aside his morality and take a loan from his neighbor, Kotayya (Kota Srinivasa Rao). Unable to bear the defeat of his ideology and moral issues, he commits suicide by consuming poison the same day he gives money to his children. The rest of the film is about how his children and wife realize just how important he was as they prepare his funeral. At last, everyone realizes that after death only love and affection will come with us so love the people and society.
