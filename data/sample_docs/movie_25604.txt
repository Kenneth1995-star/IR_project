Khoon Ka Karz

Arrested for a wide variety of infringements of the Indian Penal Code, Karan, Kishan and Arjun recount to the court how two of them were adopted and nursed by a saintly woman, Sarita Devi; how they fell in love with Tara, Sheetal and Sagarika respectively; how they took to crime; the transformation of an oil merchant to Hitler and Shri Ravan; and how they ended up being arrested by the police and in their present predicament.
After good-hearted Savitri Devi (Sushma Seth) was robbed of her baby by her criminal husband, she started raising orphaned children in an ashram, teaching them truth and honesty. But not all her children follow this path as grown-ups, e.g., Arjun (Sanjay Dutt) and Kishan (Rajnikant). Society didn't grant them access to a better future because they are orphans and poor, so they took on the criminal path and got in with dubious Champaklal (Kader Khan), whose son Robin (Kiran Kumar) wants to establish a mighty mafia imperium in India.
But Karan (Vinod Khanna), another former foster child of Savitri's, gives them a rough time as Savitri has begged him to save Arjun and Kishan from the path of crime. For this purpose, Karan gets help from his love, tough taxi driver Tara Lele (Dimple Kapadia), and even from Kishan's and Arjun's girlfriends Sheetal (Kimi Katkar) and Sagarika (Sangeeta Bijlani). But when Kishan and Arjun learn some unexpected truths, their aversion for Karan decreases a bit.
