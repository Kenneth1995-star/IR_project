Six naive British and American volunteers arrive on kibbutz Kfar Ezra for a working holiday, exchanging their labour for the opportunity to experience first-hand its unique collective lifestyle. When Mike (Sam Robards), a young medical student, falls in love with Gila (Joanna Pacu≈Ça), the Israeli girl who is organizing the volunteers' work and accommodation, he must choose between a life with her and returning home.
