Meghana (Anjala Zhaveri) is a US-educated girl staying in L.A, who has a lover called Sujit (Jagapati Babu) back in India. Sashi meets Meghana at a party. Meghana develops a few preconceived wrong notions about Sashi by observing him talking to various girls. When Sashi plans his trip to India along with his troop he chooses to travel in Leo Star Cruiseliner from Singapore to Vizag. Incidentally, Meghana too takes the same route to Vizag to meet her longtime love Sujit. As they travel together they get to know more about each other. Though they are aware of the fact that they do have fiancees, they could not stop inevitable thing happening. They fall in love with each other. Being a matured lover, Sashi explains Meghana that the feelings they have for each other might have been generated out of infatuation. Sashi comes up with a proposal that they must stay away from meeting and talking to each other for 90 days and spend their time with their respective fiancees. On the 90th day if they have the same feeling as of today they will meet at the lighthouse of Vizag port. Then they can dump their fiancees to get married to each other. After waiting for 90 days, Meghana is standing at the lighthouse of Vizag port. Sashi meets with an accident en route to the lighthouse. Thereby he fails to make it meet Meghana and express his love. A disappointed Meghana agrees to marry Sujit. As Sujit and Meghana are about to tie the knots, Sashi attends the marriage to singing a song. We have four characters (Sashi, Meghana, Sujit and Rukhmini) eagerly waiting for the things to happen. To know what we have in store for the climax.
