Dr. Chakrapani Shastri (Mohan Agashe), fondly known as Appa, is a retired Sanskrit professor and a former director of Oriental Research Institute, Pune. Shastri currently lives with Ram (Om Bhutkar), a young student as his caretaker, and has been diagnosed with the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. One day, as Ram has to appear for his exams, Shastri's elder daughter Ira (Iravati Harshe) takes Shastri to her house. While driving back home, Ira stops at a shop, requesting Shastri to stay in the car. While sitting in the car, Shastri sees a passing elephant on the road. He gets fascinated and with some help gets himself out of the car and starts following the elephant through the lanes of the city. When Ira comes back and finds her father missing from the car, she and her husband, Madhav (Milind Soman), starts looking for Shastri at various places and also reports him to the police station.
As Shastri keeps following Laxmiâ€”the elephant, her mahout Anta (Nachiket Purnapatre) tries to get Shastri back to his house. However, Shastri does not remember anything and reaches mahout's house where he meets mahout's wife Channamma (Amruta Subhash). She takes care of Shastri along with her new-born and offers him a new family. Ira informs Devika (Devika Daftardar) about their missing father but Devika blames Ira for the happening and suggests an old-age home for him. Police traces the elephant's whereabouts and finds Shastri but accuses mahout for kidnapping Shastri and informs Ira. Shastri refuses to go back to Ira and wants to stay with Channamma but she convinces him. Shastri agrees and Ira requests police to drop all the charges.
