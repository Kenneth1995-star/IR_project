Aatish

Mr. Rai is a wealthy businessman in Jammu, India, and lives in a palatial house with his wife, Shobha, a wheelchair-bound daughter, Ashu, a grown son, Rakesh, and a school-going son, Raju. His son despises him and is waiting for him for to die so that he can inherit all the wealth and spend it on dancing girls, alcohol, and gambling. One day while Rai was returning from the Jammu & Kashmir Bank with a suitcase full of cash, he is attacked by bandits, but is rescued by a young man named Anand. Anand is injured in this attack and is nursed by Shobha and the rest of the Rai family. Rai himself trusts Anand and initially appoints him as a Chief Supervisor, very much to the chagrin of Rakesh, who attempts, in vain, to implicate Anand in the theft of 2 Lakh Rupees. Anand uses fisticuffs to convince a hoodlum named Girdhari to let go of Rai's property. These incidents provoke Rai to ask Rakesh to leave the house and promote Anand as the Manager. What the Rai family do not know is that Anand actually works for Girdhari and enacted this charade just to get in the good books of the Rai family - his motive to steal a golden statue of a Hindu Deity. He then steals the statue and Rai caught him red-handed and had a heart attack and died instantly and the family members rejected him and distrusted him.
