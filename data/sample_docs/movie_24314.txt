Anokha Pyar

Ashok (Dilip Kumar) is an impoverished writer waiting for his book to be published. He meets Bindiya (Nalini Jaywant), a flower-seller, who insists he buy some flowers from her. Ashok gives his last two annas (12 pence) to her. A rogue tries to get the money from Bindiya and when Ashok tries to help her, he is knocked down and loses his eyesight. Bindiya takes Ashok to the local doctor whose daughter Geeta (Nargis) falls in love with him. Since he has no place to stay, the doctor gives Ashok accommodation in his house till he improves. Bindiya has also fallen in love with Ashok, and when Ashok is implicated in a probable murder she visits him in jail. Geeta's father dies and her two aunts come to stay with her and try to get her married. Meanwhile, Bindiya finds a suicide note from the apparent murdered victim and Ashok is set free. Geeta's aunts see Bindiya with Ashok and come to the opinion that she's his wife. They get Geeta to agree to get engaged to Ashok's publisher. After some more melodramatic turns in the story, Bindiya dies and Ashok and Geeta are united. Ashok's book becomes hugely popular.
