The Pleasure Girls

When a beautiful young girl, Sally (Francesca Annis), moves to London to pursue a modelling career, she moves in with Angela (Anneke Wills) and Dee (Suzanna Leigh) and discovers the world of the carefree bachelor girl in Swinging London of the 1960s. Over one weekend - filled with parties, blossoming friendships, and romantic encounters with Keith (Ian McShane) and Nikko (Klaus Kinski) - the vivacious girls learn about life's pleasures and pains.
