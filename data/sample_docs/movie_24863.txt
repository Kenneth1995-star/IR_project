Sub Ka Saathi

A family social film, strongly advocating national integration and economic equality, it tells of a millionaire's son, brought up by a Harijan (untouchable) couple, fighting against the evil machinations of his wealthy father to provide his kin the promised "uptopia" and also make his father repent for the manner in which he amassed his wealth.
