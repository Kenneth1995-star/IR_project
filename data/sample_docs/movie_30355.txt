Annai

A wealthy widow, Kanagamahalakshmi (Bhanupriya), who loses her husband (Nassar) and unborn child in a car crash, opts to look after an orphan child for a period one of month every year. Her decision operates smoothly for a few years, however when the child Anjali (Baby Sadhika) returns to the house for a third year, problems begin to arise. She expresses her distaste at the various deficiencies of Kanagamahalakshmi's household, including her foster parent itself. How the little child makes the members in the house behave properly, forms the rest of the story.
