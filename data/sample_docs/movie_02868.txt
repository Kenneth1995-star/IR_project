Lucky Cisco Kid

A gang of outlaws, led by Judge McQuade (William Robertson), are committing crimes and blaming it on the Cisco Kid (Cesar Romero), in McQuade's attempt to drive the settlers off the land and buy it himself. The Cisco Kid and Gordito (Chris-Pin Martin) eventually stop the scheme, and the Kid falls in love with widow Emily Lawrence (Evelyn Venable).
