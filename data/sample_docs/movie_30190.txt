Mettukudi

The story starts in the 9th century. The King Raja Raja Chola presents his valuable sword to his soldier for playing a vital role in winning a war. It was preserved by his family descendants. This information was known by an archeologist who plans to steal it due to its monetary value. Presently Gemini Ganesan is charged with the care of the sword.
The villain plans to send Karthik to do this job. He enters into the palace as the son (who ran off from the family in his childhood) of Manivannan, who is the son in law of Gemini Ganesan. Everything went smooth initially. However Nagma, grand daughter of Gemini, fell in love with him. The situation called for Karthik to marry her. Later Nagma came to know the truth and challenges him about stealing the sword.
In the meantime Gemini Ganesan not knowing Karthik for what he came there for, gave the sword to him and pressed him to look after it. This made Karthik realize his mistake and promises him to protect it. The climax occurs when he manages to protect the sword from the villain, and the family accepted Karthik after learning of the truth.
