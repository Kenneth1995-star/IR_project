Adhisaya Manithan

Gowthami and her friends come to a deserted mansion and slowly encounter horror in the form of the devil man who would come alive and kill one by one until Gouthami escapes from the devil. The ending shows that the movie would continue hinting a third sequel. However, due to heavy losses incurred, the movie did not have any further sequel.
The movie was heavily inspired by Friday the 13th Part III
