Ti Saddhya Kay Karte

Anurag is wondering about Tanvi the girl he first loved at a reunion party. His friend Pawan tells him that she is back in the country for a few days. Anurag rejects the idea of meeting her but then agrees to meet her. He remembers their first meeting as kids, becoming very good friends and then falling for her. He decides Tanvi is his first love and they will be together for their lives. As they enter college, Anuraag is attracted to other girls, Mohini - the diva and Anjali - a simpleton but soon realises that they were infatuations when Tanvi takes care of him and his family as his father suffers from heart attack. He decides to propose her on the farewell but gets drunk and fights with Tanvi, which hurts her and they stop talking. Soon after this incident, Tanvi leaves for Delhi and then goes on to Boston for further studies without informing Anuraag. Anuraag decides to meet Tanvi once to ask her why she left without telling him anything. He meets Tanvi and her daughter and asks her out for coffee. He debates with himself whether to tell her that he is married and has a daughter but cannot talk to Tanvi during this meeting. She leaves from there and he messages her later if she would meet him for one last time. Tanvi does not agree. Next day, she goes to his house where she meets his mother, wife and daughter, Tanvi. His mother tells her that Anuraag was adamant to name her "Tanvi", after his best friend. Tanvi replies to Anuraag that she cannot meet him as she is leaving for Boston. Heartbroken, Anuraag goes to the old colony and sees Tanvi on the terrace. They resolve their differences and remain friends.
