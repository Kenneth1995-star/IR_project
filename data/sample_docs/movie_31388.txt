Oru Naal Koothu

Three young women, face unique challenges in their process of getting married, which are very relatable to, and typical of the South Indian society. Rajkumar (Dinesh), who is in love with his colleague Kavya (Nivetha Pethuraj), is reluctant to marry her, owing to her superior economic background. He deliberately delays talks of marriage, asking more time from Kavya to "settle" himself in a well-off position. Lakshmi (Miya) is visited by several suitors through the course of many years, and every one of them is rejected by her proud, conservative father, whose greediness makes him wait every time for a better suitor who is par the family's status. While Bhaskar agrees to marry Susheela (Riythvika), he suddenly gets cold feet and calls off the marriage, insulting Susheela every time she demands an explanation. The story unfolds, telling how each of the protagonists attempt to fight the dogma of arranged-marriage culture, so deep-rooted in the Indian society. The story is based on the experiences of the director himself.
