Angel

Angel Deverell (Romola Garai) is considered an outsider in the town of Norley. She has a fanciful imagination and prefers to be alone, writing. Her mother, a shopkeeper, and her aunt, who works for the family that lives in the grand house called Paradise, don't understand her.
She finishes writing her novel, Lady Irania, and sends it off. Theo Gilbright (Sam Neill) offers to publish her novel, but he requires that she make some changes. Angel refuses and leaves in tears. Theo comes after her and offers to publish the novel as it is. That evening, they dine at Theo's house, where Theo's wife, Hermione (Charlotte Rampling), takes an immediate dislike to Angel.
Angel becomes a success, publishing several novels. At an event, she meets Nora (Lucy Russell), who is a great admirer of Angel, and her brother, Esmé (Michael Fassbender), an artist. Angel buys Paradise and hires Nora as her personal secretary. She marries Esmé. The Great War breaks out. Esmé enlists and Angel is heartbroken.
