As both of them didn’t have money, Maqsood forces Manoj into performing in a porn film made by his gang. Maqsood tells them that this film will not be sold in India and will only sell overseas.
Contrary to Maqsood’s words, the forthcoming week, the porn movie DVDs spread in the capital.
The gang members while writing one of the DVDs mistakenly write Maqsood’s important data on the DVD and distribute it. This DVD falls in the hands of Pushp.
