Ladies Tailor

Sundaram (Rajendra Prasad) is a talented but very lazy tailor who believes that good fortune and luck alone will make him a rich and successful person. He is the only tailor in the whole village. Even though Sitaramudu (Subhalekaha Sudhakar), the assistant of Sundaram, and Batala Satyam (Mallikarjuna Rao), the cloth vendor, keep urging him to work, he never listens to them. One day a soothsayer, (Rallapalli), tells Sundaram that he will become a rich person if he marries a woman with a mole on her thigh. In the process of discovering this woman, he flirts with many in the village and promises all of them that he would marry them.
The rest of the story revolves around how he deals with each lady with his talent and deceit. In the end, everyone discovers the truth and Sundaram is made to realise that in his foolish quest to find the lady with the mole, he has cheated and hurt many people. He then tries to atone for his crimes by first apologising to all the women he cheated and then by marrying the one who truly loved him. His assistant Sitaramudu ends up marrying the girl with the mole.
