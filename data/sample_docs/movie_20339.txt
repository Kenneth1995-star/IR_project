That Summer

It is the story of a 21-year-old named Steve Brodie (Ray Winstone) who goes to the Devon seaside resort of Torquay after leaving borstal where he is seen easily winning in a swimming race. He befriends the son of a butcher from London named Jimmy (Tony London) and they start dating two girls from Northern England. Steve works in a pub, Jimmy hires skiffs on the beach and the girls are employed as chambermaids at a hotel. Three loutish Scottish youths have some confrontations with Steve and then frame him for a robbery at a chemist shop. This leads to his arrest just before the start of a 'round the bay' swimming race in which he is due to compete against one of them.
The soundtrack was produced as an LP with several punk bands. The album was available on unique yellow vinyl.
