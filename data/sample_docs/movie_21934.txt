My Friend Max (Mon amie Max)

The film is set in contemporary Quebec City, Quebec.[2]
Catherine (Marthe Keller), a concert pianist, is surprised one night by the arrival of her childhood friend Max (Genevi√®ve Bujold), whom she hasn't seen for 25 years.
Catherine and Max were students together at the Music Conservatory in Quebec City, and were the most promising pianists. While still in her teens, the adventurous Max gets pregnant. She wants to keep the child, but her domineering mother forces her to give him up for adoption. The rebellious Max then leaves Quebec and the music world.
Now, years later, she returns, obsessed with finding her son. With the help of Catherine, she locates the adoption records and social workers contact her son to ask if he wants to see her. He refuses, but she keeps trying until they are reunited.
