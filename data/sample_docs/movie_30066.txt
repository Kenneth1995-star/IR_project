Vijay (Vijay) is the grandson of Manorama while Anitha (Sanghavi) is the daughter of Raghavan (Vijayakumar) and Bhagyalakshmi (Sri Vidya). Anitha's family rent one of Manorama's houses. Vijay and Anitha pretend to hate each other while they actually are in love. But later Anitha's father came to know the love matter and he requests transfer to Chennai. Before going Anitha leaves her new address on several envelopes and she tells those are love letters given by Vijay, Anitha's father gets angry and takes the letters and went to Vijay's house and tells him to take his useless love letters. After that Vijay takes it and as he looks at it he knows that those aren't love letters, they're all Anitha's new address in Chennai.
Vijay tries to find her. One day Vijay goes to a restaurant in Chennai to eat and he asks the server where is the washroom. The server tells him that there are two washrooms, one on the upstairs and another on the current ground floor. The server tells him to not go upstairs because it's dangerous. Vijay goes upstairs to the bathroom to expose himself to the Chennai people, but there, he finds a "Sex Film" illegal shooting happening.
By this, they blame Vijay for the death of the restaurant owner (who tripped) and Vijay just has to escape. This news reaches Anitha's father who is a police officer. He tries to capture Vijay. But at last, Raghavan understands Vijay's innocence and unites Anitha with him. Finally, Vijay kills the Villain also, who was really responsible for the restaurant owner's death. Hence the film ends with a happy note.
