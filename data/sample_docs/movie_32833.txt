Samurai III: Duel At Ganryu Island

Takezo (Musashi) abandons his life as a knight errant. He's sought as a teacher and vassal by Shogun, Japan's most powerful clan leader. He's also challenged to fight by the supremely confident and skillful Sasaki Kojiro. Takezo agrees to fight Kojiro in a year's time but rejects Shogun's patronage, choosing instead to live on the edge of a village, raising vegetables. He's followed there by Otsu and later by Akemi, both in love with him. The year ends as Takezo assists the villagers against a band of brigands. He seeks Otsu's forgiveness and accepts her love, then sets off across the water to Ganryu Island for his final contest.
In the large city of Edo in Japan, Kojiro Sasaki kills multiple men in a battle in the street.[2] The commotion resulting from the battle in the street garners the attention of Musashi Miyamoto who is nearby in the city.[2] Musashi Miyamoto leaves his room to see what has occurred and notices the dead men in the street as well as a note from Kojiro Sasaki claiming responsibility for the killing.[2] Sasaki and Miyamoto eventually meet one another and agree to a fight.[2] However, on the day the fight is planned, Miyamoto decides to delay the fight for a year.[2] During this year before the fight, Sasaki becomes acquainted with the upper class, while Miyamoto begins farming near a small village.[2] Both Miyamoto and Sasaki travel to Ganryu Island for their fight with one another.[2] During this fight, Miyamoto kills Sasaki and is victorious.[2] However, Miyamoto is unhappy about killing Sasaki, calling him "the greatest swordsman" he ever encountered, and silently mourns for him.
