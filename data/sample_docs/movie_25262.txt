Lovers

Viju (Kumar Gaurav) lives near Panji, Goa, with his poor mother (Beena Banerjee), who teaches music to make a living. Mary (Padmini Kohlapure), sister of a rich landlord David (Danny Denzongpa) comes home from Bombay to visit her family during her vacations. The two characters fall in love with each other. On getting to know this, David beats Mary black-and-blue and plans to get her married. During these events, David violates his maid and cleanly gets away with it. But this earns him his wife's (Tanuja) wrath, and she tries to help Mary unite with Viju against the wishes of David.
David then attempts to kill both Viju and Mary with the help of the villagers, as he feels the only punishment that they deserve for loving each other, is death. Will the lovers ever unite, or will they be constantly torn apart due to the various odds and obstacles of the society, is what forms the rest of the story. The film was the remake of the Tamil hit movie Alaigal Oivathillai, also directed by Bharathiraja, and the soundtrack was composed by R.D. Burman.
