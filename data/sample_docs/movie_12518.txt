Night Watch

UN agents Mike Graham (Brosnan) and Sabrina Carver (Alexandra Paul) are sent by their director Nick Caldwell to investigate the theft of Rembrandt's painting, The Night Watch. The trail takes them from Amsterdam initially to Hong Kong and involves them in not only art theft and forgery, but in the more serious high-tech schemes of Martin Schraeder and his bald North Korean cohort Mao Yixin.
