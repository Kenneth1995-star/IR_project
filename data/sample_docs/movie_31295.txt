Tamiluku En Ondrai Aluthavum

A deadly bomb will be activated if a computer geek restores a part of Chennai city's mobile networks, which are down due to a solar flare. Four people are linked to each other on a deadly mission.
Mukil (Dinesh Ravi) falls in love with Simi (Bindu Madhavi), who is stuck in a pit hole with an 80-tonne gigantic 'Vaasthu' rock under suspension which is ready to fall on her at any time. The only way that Simi can escape from this danger is if her text message reaches Mukil.
In the meantime, there is a hyperactive science geek Vasanth (Nakul), who is on a mission to activate a dead mobile network signal. then there is a call taxi driver Raja (Sathish), whose car has a remotely operated bomb planted in it by a terrorist outfit waiting to destroy the city once the phone lines are restored. Does the city escape destruction from the bomb and what happens with the four main characters forms the rest of the story.
