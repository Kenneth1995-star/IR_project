Soon he loses his heart. He starts teasing her and wants to prove that he is sincerely loving Nandu. He tells Nandu that he could do anything for her. Then the latter tells him that he should not follow her until she calls him. In order to grab her attention, he sends his father (Chandramohan) and mother (Pragati) to express his love and let her know that they too encourage him instead of trying to divert his attention from love.
