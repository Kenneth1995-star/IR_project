The Thirty Million Rush

Fatty (Eric Tsang) is an employee at a mint, where one day, he discovers a shredding machine that crashed for a moment before resuming its operations. Because of that moment, an amount of HK$30 million of bank notes, which were meant to be shredded, survived. Discovering this secret, Fatty conspires with his friends, Tomboy (Angile Leung) and Mark Mark Cheng), to steal the money for themselves. Seeking for professional help, the trio join forces with Baldy (Karl Maka), an ex-con recently released from prison. While discussing their plan, they were overheard by a Catholic nun, Sister Maria (Brigitte Lin), who is determined to prevent them from committing sins in order to save their souls.
