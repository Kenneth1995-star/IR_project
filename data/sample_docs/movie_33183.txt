Hiruko the Goblin

Reijiro Hieda, a young and energetic archeologist, has been discredited since advocating heretical theories. A letter from his brother-in-law Yabe, a junior high school teacher, tells of his discovery of an ancient tomb built to appease evil spirits. Hieda eagerly goes to investigate, only to find that Yabe has mysteriously disappeared along with one of his students, Reiko Tsukishima. Meanwhile, Yabe's son, Masao, searches for his father in the school during summer vacation and encounters Reiko. Masao becomes engulfed in a mysterious atmosphere, and strange creatures appear, upon which his back begins to ache and emit smoke. Hieda appears and saves Masao. Together they search the premises and find a sea of blood and a headless body while Reiko's quiet voice is heard singing.
