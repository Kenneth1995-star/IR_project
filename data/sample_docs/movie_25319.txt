Kalyani is a young beautiful woman who falls in love with a young man named Jeetu. Jeetu confesses his love for Kalyani and promises her to be always by her side. Kalyani and Jeetu make love to each other. After her mother's death, Kalyani proposes to Jeetu to get married. Jeetu declares that he is not willing to spend the rest of his life with Kalyani. Kalyani feels like she has been deceived and loses all the yearning for her life. She plunges into a river they were standing beside and is drifted to somewhere else where a man named Gokul finds her unconscious on the surface of the water. Gokul brings her to his home and cures her well. Kalyani gets married to Gokul. Eventually Jeetu comes to know that Kalyani has been married to a man of an inferior caste. Jeetu meets her and confesses that he is contrite for what he told her earlier and now he wants her back in his life. He also tries to persuade her that she cannot spend the rest of her life with a man like Gokul who belongs to an indigent lower caste. Gokul overhears what Jeetu says to Kalyani and he tries to insist her to get back to Jeetu. But she holds her ground firmly. She declares that she has fallen for Gokul and is not willing to leave him at any cost. Gokul is overjoyed to have heard this and they embrace each other.
