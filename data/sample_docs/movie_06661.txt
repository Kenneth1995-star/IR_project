Stranger at My Door

Outlaw Clay Anderson and his gang rob the town bank and flee in different directions. Clay's horse gives out and he is forced to hide at a nearby farm. Clay soon discovers that the farm belongs to preacher Hollis Jarret, the preacher's new wife, and children. The preacher lets Clay stay at the farm, reasoning that he can convince the outlaw to turn over a new leaf.
