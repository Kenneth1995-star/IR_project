A Scream from Silence (Mourir à tue-tête)

A young nurse named Suzanne is kidnapped, assaulted and brutally raped in the back of a truck by a woman-hating stranger. The nurse's rape and the aftermath are part of a film which a director and her editor are working on. From time to time they pause the film to discuss their intentions and reactions to the film they are making. Mixed in with the story is documentary footage of the stories of other women who have been raped around the world.
