Glamour Boy

Former child star Tiny Barlow is all grown up now but desperate to regain his old fame. He grabs credit for landing aspiring actress Joan Winslow a part that was intended for bigger star Brenda Lee, then tries to persuade studio head A. J. Colder to remake the film that made him a star.
Tiny's schemes land him a part in a new film, but he quits when others mock him on the set. A new child star, Billy Doran, hides in the trunk of Tiny's car, and they end up taking shelter on a farm hundreds of miles from Hollywood, where young Billy decides to pretend he's been kidnapped. Joan's pleas convince Tiny and Billy to return.
