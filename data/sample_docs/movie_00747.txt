We Faw Down

The Boys (Stan and Oliver) are trying to attend a poker game. When they get a phone call telling them their absence is holding up the game, Oliver tell their wives they have a business engagement at the Orpheum Theater. They then sneak off to their poker game. En route, they gallantly stop to assist two young ladies retrieve a hat that has blown under a parked car. They end up being soaked by a passing street-cleaning vehicle while trying to retrieve it. The girls invite them up to their apartment while their clothes dry. One of the females becomes very amorous with Stan. They all proceed to get buzzed from beer. A large boyfriend of one of the females appears at the apartment, sending the duo scrambling out the back window, in full view of their wives who have already seen a newspaper headline announcing that the Orpheum Theater had been gutted by a fire. The boys return home and are quietly grilled to explain what they saw at the show. After their attempt to describe what they saw, they too see the newspaper headline about the Orpheum Theater fire, thus destroying their alibi. Their wives chase them through an alley with a shotgun. One blast of causes about a dozen cheating husbands to scurry out of various windows with fright.
