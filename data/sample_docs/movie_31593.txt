Illarikam

Venu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is an orphan brought up by his maternal uncle Dharmayya (Ramana Reddy). He falls in love with Zamindar's (Gummadi) daughter Radha (Jamuna). He married with a condition that Venu should live in their house called Illarikam. Due to status-conscious Sundaramma (Hemalatha), wife of Zamindar looks down on Venu and insults him indirectly. Govindayya (C.S.R. Anjaneyulu) cousin brother of Sundaramma and also manager of their mica factories creates problems between Venu and Radha. Because he plots to usurp the wealth. So, he brings his wayward son Seshagiri (R. Nageswara Rao) weaning away from Kanakadurga (Girija) whom he had secretly married. Venu spots Kanakadurga, his presumed to be dead sister while she was performing on stage. Not knowing they are siblings, Radha suspects Venuâ€™s fidelity. The villains try to cash in on their rift. When things are getting worse Venu wears a Zorro-like guise, teaches Govindayya and his son a lesson and paves way for a happy family reunion.
