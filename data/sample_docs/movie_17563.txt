Windrider

Stewart 'P.C.' Simpson (Burlinson) lives in a magnificent beachfront home, and is an enthusiastic windsurfer, indulging his passion for windsurfing on a daily basis. His wealthy father, (Tingwell) may fault his inconsistency in working within his father's company, but can appreciate his son's remarkable abilities on the waves. With the help of his father's company's engineer Howard (Chilvers), he develops a high tech sailboard for the coming world windsurfing championship. Jade (Kidman) is a rock singer, who starts a romance with P.C., but as their romance blooms, sport, friends and the upcoming championship become secondary.[5]
