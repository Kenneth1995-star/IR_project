Mitta Miraasu

Chellaiya has two missions in life. One, is to remove the taint on the family name and expose the man behind his family's misfortunes. Two is to make his younger sibling a lawyer, so that it will help him in achieving mission one. The villain of the piece is Chellaiya's own uncle Masilamani ( Alex) who had turned the villagers against Chellaiya's father Singha Perumal (Napoleon). Humiliated by the same people who had revered him once, Perumal dies of shock soon after (a laborious death scene). A few decades have passed since the incident, but Chellaiya seems nowhere near to fulfilling his mission, nor has Masilamani given up his wicked ways.
In fact Masilamani is stronger now, what with his two sons grown up and matching their father step tp step in his villainy. The trio have no redeeming qualities. Many cliched scenes later Chellaiya fulfills his mission and redeems his family's reputation.
