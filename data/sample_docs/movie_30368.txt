Unnai Kodu Ennai Tharuven

Surya (Ajith) has been brought up in the army training barracks in Wellington (Ooty), ever since his mother(Sukanya) handed him over as a baby to the camp brigadier (Nasser). She tells the officer the reason for her action but the audience is not allowed to hear it at this point. Surya grows up to be a patriotic youth and the best soldier in his class. He is about to complete his training in 3 months and leave to the border. He falls in love with Indu (Simran), the daughter of a senior army officer, who is visiting Wellington Camp. Indu's parents accept her choice of husband and the family leaves to kashmir. Soon after, Indu's father dies in a bomb blast while her mother loses her life on seeing her husband's body. Not wishing to lose her husband too in war, Indu asks Surya to choose between her and the army. Surya then asks the brigadier to advise him, and the brigadier tells the story of his parents. His father Bomb Sekhar (R. Parthipen) was a very violent terrorist, who was sentenced to 3 years prison and death. His mother was a nun, who visited prisoners and chanted Bible verses to them. Slowly, Surya's father's nature begins to change and nearing his death, he is completely reformed. Sensing that there is no way for him to repent for his mistakes by serving the nation, he asks the nun one last favor. She must bear him a son. The nun agrees and they mate inside the prison secretly. She leaves him and the next day he is hanged. So surya says, his birth was to serve the nation as a soldier, and if she wants to marry him, she must wait for the next 12 years till his service is over. Indu agrees, and Surya moves with his barrack to the border.
