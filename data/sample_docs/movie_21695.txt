Crowhurst

A tragedy that is both grand and pathetic. In October 1968, Donald Crowhurst, a 35-year-old engineer and father of four, embarked on one of the last great adventures of the 20th Century. He was one of nine men who set out from the English coast that autumn as part of the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, chasing to be either the first or the fastest man to circumnavigate the globe â€“ single-handed and non-stop. But for Donald the dream turned into a nightmare.
