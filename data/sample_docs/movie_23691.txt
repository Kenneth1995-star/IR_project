The Bounty

With an optimistic attitude towards life, Cho Sai Fung (Chapman To) is a neurotic man with extraordinary skills, who relies on bounty hunting to make a living. This time he comes to an island, a small hotel called LAZY Inn, to hunt down a fugitive robber Lee Kin Fai, with a HK$4000,000 reward from the police. Suen Long Ching (Fiona Sit) is the innkeeper's (Alex Man) daughter. She has a rich imagination and curiosity, and is a little hyperactive. The nosy father and daughter have been monitoring the weird customer Cho, with the repeated wrong touch and misunderstanding, attracts a variety of funny jokes.
