New Orleans Uncensored

The docks of New Orleans, Louisiana are controlled by Zero Saxon, a notorious racketeer. When former naval officer Dan Corbett arrives in town, wanting to open a shipping business of his own, he accepts a job working for Saxon to make some money, unaware of how corrupt Saxon's operation is.
Alma Mae, girlfriend of longshoremen's union representative Jack Petty, are impressed by Dan when he flattens a drunk who has been annoying her. They help arrange Dan a job through Saxon's dock manager, Joe Reilly, whose wife Marie then invites Dan to dinner and introduces him to her brother, Scrappy Durant, a former prizefighter.
Joe is killed by Saxon's thugs to keep him from informing on the illegal activities at the docks. Marie admits she's been expecting this to happen. Dan goes undercover, trying to help the New Orleans police investigate. Due to a misunderstanding, Scrappy attacks him in a boxing ring and Dan accidentally kills him with a punch. Dan is then beaten by Saxon's men, but with Alma's and Marie's help, he is able to assist the police in placing Saxon under arrest.
