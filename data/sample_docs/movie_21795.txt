Boys and Girls

The father of a girl is a fox farmer. He had silver foxes. In autumn and early winter, when their fur was good, he killed them and shaved their skins and sold them to the company. In winter, the family raised two horses until they were killed for the fox. Mike is an old and indifferent horse, and Flora is a highly stressed and nervous mare. The girl had never seen a killed horse. Curiosity forced her and her brother to watch their father shoot Mike. They saw their father take out his cigarette paper and tobacco; he shot a horse. Although her attempt to escape Mike's death is inevitable, she fears its impact on Laird. For the first time, she felt embarrassed, guarded and restrained his father. [5] In the movie, the girl also tried to avoid her grandmother. She often used her behavior and acted in a more ladylike manner. One day, the girl and her brother Laired sat watching it. Their father took the fur out of the fox's body. Naked, slippery bodies have been collected in a bag and buried in rubbish. Living fox lived in the world that their father made for them. It is surrounded by a high fence, like a medieval town, with a door lock at night. At the end of the movie, another horse, Flora, came out of the barn. Her father shouted that she had closed the door opposite the venue so that the horse would not run away. In a one-second decision, she decided not to close the door. Her brother Laird saw her do it. Plant area escapes. But her father eventually returned to Flora after the truck. At dinner that night, Laird said his sister deliberately opened the door. Her father asked if this was true, the girl, tore up, admit it was true. The father asked her in disgust why she did so. She began to cry earnestly; she could not explain herself. Then, the father said, "It doesn't matter... She's just a girl." This sentence forgives her but dismisses her.[6]
