Love Clinic

Wang Seong-ki is a male obstetrician/gynecologist and Gil Sin-seol is a female urologist. Handsome Seong-ki is loved by all his female patients, but he secretly struggles with impotence after he fails to deliver a baby via Caesarean section. Meanwhile, the equally attractive Sin-seol is an expert on men's bodies, but is actually a virgin with an abysmal dating history. When Seong-ki opens his clinic on the same floor in the same building as Sin-seol's clinic, the two romantically-challenged doctors begin to constantly bump into each other and bicker.
