He Found a Star

Theatrical agent Lucky Lyndon (Vic Olive) and his loyal secretary Ruth Cavour (Sarah Churchill) use their talent agency to discover unknowns. In his search for the next "big star," Lyndon attempts to promote ungrateful nightclub singer Suzanne (Evelyn Dall). Meanwhile, Ruth, who is madly in love with Lyndon, makes an unexpected impression when she turns singer to cover for the increasingly difficult Suzanne.
