Subash

Subash (Arjun), a good-for-nothing youth, enjoys his life as much as possible. His brother, Rajasekhar (Siddique), is a minister and his father (Jaishankar) is a court judge. Subash falls in love with Savitri (Revathi), a middle class Brahmin girl. Savitri loves him but she wants to marry with a intrepid man so Subash joins the army and becomes a military officer.
Upon his return, his family reveals that Savitri and her father died in an accident. Arumugasamy (Prakash Raj), an honest politician, thought being Rajasekhar's opposite party is Rajasekhar's best friend, dies mysteriously.
Subash suspects Thangamani (Manivannan), Arumugasamy's right hand, for Arumugasamy's death. Later, he finds Savitri in Thangamani's house and saves her. Savitri discloses that Rajasekhar is a corrupted politician and is linked to the terrorists. Rajasekhar's henchmen killed Arumugasamy and Thangamani began to sequester her.
Subash swears to punish his brother and saves his country.
