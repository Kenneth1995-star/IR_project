Thavasi

Thavasi (Vijayakanth) is an influential do-gooder landlord in a small village, who commands respect from village. Thavasi and his wife (Jayasudha) arrange for the marriage of their son Boopathi (also Vijayakanth) with Priyadarshini/Priya (Soundarya). Sankarapandi (Nassar), who had killed Thavasi's sister after marrying her, wants to marry his daughter (whom he had with his second wife) to Boopathi. Thanagarasu (Sriman), who is accused of stealing jewels, commits suicide. Thangarasu's mother Maragathammal (Vadivukkarasi) questions Thavasi's judgement. Thavasi decides to send Bhoopathi to his home. Maragathammal hates Boopathi and treats him like a dirt though Boopathi tolerates it. Sankarapandi wants his daughter to wed Bhoopathi. Boopathi, unknown to Maragathammal, saves Thanagarasu's dumb sister from Kottaiperumal and also reforms Kaarmegam (Ilavarasu), which Karmegam reveals to Maragathammal in Boopathi's marriage. In the end, a goon who was supposed to be dumb blurts out the truth that Sankarapandi was responsible for the temple theft, and he murdered Thanagarasu and made it to look like suicide. In the end, Bhoopathi unites with Priya.
