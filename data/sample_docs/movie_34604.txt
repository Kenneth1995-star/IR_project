Kim Joon, a transfer student of a prestigious high school, is arrested for the murder of one of his classmates. Yoo jin, the top student of his class, was found dead in the woods behind the school and strong evidence and a group of students' testimonies point to Joon, but after some questioning with the police, he is released.
