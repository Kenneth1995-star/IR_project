Vicky Dada

Akkineni Nagarjuna is a graduate in law. He and Juhi Chawla are both in love with each other. She one day leaves out of town for a while and comes back to see Nagarjuna as a thug named Vicky Dada (his titular role). Nagarjuna turned into a criminal because of the corruption in court. He is after the villains (led by Kannada Prabhakar). How he stops them and helps the poor forms the rest of the story.
