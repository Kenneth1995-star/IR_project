Good Vibrations

In 1970s sectarian Belfast in the midst of the bloody Troubles DJ Terri Hooley (Dormer) opens a record shop "on the most bombed half-mile in Europe". He is a music-lover, idealist, radical and rebel. He is inspired by the new underground punk scene and in turn galvanises the young musicians, branching out into record production and bringing life to the city.[2][3]
