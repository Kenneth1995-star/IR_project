Jubilee

The film is about Thomas Kora(Innocent)aged 80, who is the head of a famous family of the middle Travancore region. Residing in the estate bungalow at Peermade, he never looks more than sixty. Once the favourite henchman of Henry Sayip, Kora was presented this bungalow and estate when Henry went back to England. Thereafter people started calling him, Kora Sahib.
Kora has five sons and two daughters. His youngest son Joji(Saiju Kurup), was born on the fifty sixth birth day of Kora. Since Joji was born after the golden jubilee year of Kora, he was popularly called by the neighbours as Jubilee. An automobile engineer by profession, he was also a specialist in motor cycle races, but an immature adult who can't keep serious relationships, taking life as it comes. Moreover, he was already on his way to some kind of trouble, all the time.
Kora had a special liking to his youngest son, who at a point of time falls into clearly planned allegation of a murder. As police trace Joji, Kora has nothing else to do but to offer him all protection and to save him from the associated scandal. Joji, in the midst of all the police-firings, takes revenge on the people who deceived him.
