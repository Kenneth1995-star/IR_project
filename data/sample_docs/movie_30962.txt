He lands at Sangu Theevu, where the head of the sea pirates Alai Kallan lives. Jagathalapradhapan comes across Mohini (Namitha), who belong to the local fishermen community in the island. Romance blossom between them. Jagathalapradhapan manages to nab Alai Kallan and decides to return to his country. He promises Mohini that he would bring his parents to arrange for their wedding. However the King and his wife Mangayarkarasi (Yuvarani) arranges for their son's marriage with a princess Azhagu Nachiyar (Nila). Jagathalapradhapan tries hard to convince his parents that he would marry only Mohini.
To put an end to the problem, the king and his wife hatch a conspiracy and kills Mohini while she is in underwater using thugs. Enters a cruel tantrik (Kota Sreenivasa Rao), who uses the feud between Jagathalapradhapan and Alai Kallan and plans to kill Jagathalapradhapan and thereby get the ultimate power to rule the world. But all his plans are altered when Mohiniâ€™s spirit comes back to earth. She prevents tantrum to near Jagathalaprathapan. Meanwhile Mohini wishes to kill Jagathalaprathapan by luring him to have sex with her in an isolated forest so that she can unite with him in heaven. But the plan gets spoiled by Azhagu Nachiyar's smart tricks. Tantrik wants to kill Jagathalaprathapan using Alaikalan so that Goddess will get happy and grant his wish, but instead Jagathalaprathapan kills Alaikalan diverting it. Goddess wants him to ask his wish and she asks for Mohini to get back to her body but it's naturally impossible. Instead she inserts her soul into Azhagu Nachiyar's as alternative so that she gets "motcham". They happily rule the kingdom ever after in the end.
