Spy

The movie is set in the year 1941, months before the German invasion of Russia. The two protagonists, NKVD officers Dorin and Oktyabrsky, are hunting a German spy in Moscow. They believe their success might reveal Hitler's plans and the exact date of invasion.[1]
It is implied that Dorin is a distant relative of Erast Fandorin, the most popular character of Akunin's books.
