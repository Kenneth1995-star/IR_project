My Annoying Brother

National Judo athlete Doo-young (Do Kyung-soo) damages his optic nerves during an international event and loses his sight permanently. His older brother Doo-shik (Jo Jung-suk) who has been estranged from Doo-young, takes advantage of his brother's sudden crisis to get paroled from prison. To Doo-young who lost his parents in an accident as a teenager and had to fend for himself since then, the news of Doo-sik coming back home is an extra stress to deal with. He's barely adjusting to the fact that he is now blind for the rest of his life but now he has to deal with his swindler brother. Although hesitant at first, Doo-young slowly eases up to his older brother, who gradually takes charge and helps him adjust to his disability. Just when the two brothers are starting to make amends, Doo-sik finds out that he's in the final stage of terminal cancer. He has only a short time to say farewell to his brother and help him win gold at Rio Paralympics, which will secure his future.[1]
