Four Friends

Roy, Soorya, Amir, and Gauri come from entirely different backgrounds, but one thing that they have in common is cancer. Roy is a multi-millionaire; Amir is a small-time goonda; Soorya is a musician; and Gouri lives in distress, troubled by her stepmother. Each of them is dying from the disease (blood, liver, bone, lungs cancer) and they all come for treatment to a plush hospital, Pratheeksha, run by Dr. Nandakumar (Ganesh). Though they take some time to become friendly, they eventually become close. They decide to go to Malaysia to meet Soorya's girlfriend, because they want to be positive in their life. There is a scene with Kamal Hassan, who gives a pep talk on how he lost some of his close friends to cancer, and gives the four friends some confidence.And at last Soorya dies.
