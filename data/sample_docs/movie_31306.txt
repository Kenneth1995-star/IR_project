Katham Katham

Nandha (Nandha Durairaj) is an upright sub-inspector of police who has been transferred fifteen times in three years. He is then transferred in a police station based in Pollachi. There, the inspector of police Pandian (Natarajan Subramaniam) is in the pay of Periyannan (Rajagopalan), the local minister who runs in own government in the place. Nandha is shocked to note that Pandian and the entire police department is corrupt. Thereafter, Nandha tries hard to enforce the order. Soon, both policemen will clash. Pandian becomes an honest policeman after Periyannan's men attempt to kill him and he is revived with blood transfusions from the public. However, Nandha does not believe that he has truly changed. After a fellow honest sub-inspector gets killed by Periyannan's men, Nandha blames Pandian and through short routes becomes inspector himself. He arranges for Periyannan and his men to clash with Pandian, but in the ensuing fight, Pandian kills them all while Nandha walks away.
