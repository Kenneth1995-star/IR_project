The Hi-Jackers

Long-distance lorry driver Terry (Anthony Booth) meets Shirley (Jacqueline Ellis) at a trucker's cafe and gives her a lift. His truck, carrying a valuable shipment of whisky, is then hijacked under cover of a fake road accident. But who tipped off the hi-jackers about the route Terry would take? Police Inspector Grayson (Patrick Cargill) investigates.
