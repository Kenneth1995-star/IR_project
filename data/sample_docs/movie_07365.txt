John Bradford expects his son Jim to join his engineering firm, but Jim instead joins the ministry, attending a seminary for four years before being assigned to New Guinea.
John's secretary is Jim's sweetheart Alice, who is left behind for years before Jim proposes marriage. She goes to New Guinea, where they wed and become the parents of two children. All is well until Jim contracts a life-threatening disease. John flies to New Guinea to be with his son at the end of his life, then tries to understand its meaning and purpose through the journals Jim leaves behind.
