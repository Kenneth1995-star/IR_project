King is Dead, TheThe King is Dead

Max (Dan Wyllie) and Therese (Bojana Novakovic) have just moved into a new house, unfortunately they are now next door to a strange man named King (Gary Waddell). At first, things seem to go smoothly until King and his friends become trouble with Max and Therese and they both suspect he may be a drug dealer, so Max and Therese concoct a plan to have King move out of their neighbourhood.
