April Fool

Ashok comes from a wealthy family, which is run by his dad, and elder brother, Alok. Ashok himself is a slacker, and is only interested in slacking, and playing practical jokes, and no doubt his favorite day is fool's day, 1 April, when he outdoes himself. His jokes befriend him with Madhu, and both fall in love. Then a practical joke hits the truth, and both Ashok and Madhu become targets of an international gang, and must run for their own safety, as well as for the safety of their respective families.
