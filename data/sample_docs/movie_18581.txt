Freedom Radio

An eminent Viennese doctor in Germany becomes increasingly disillusioned with the oppressive brutality of the Nazis. His wife, however, is flattered by the attentions of the FÃ¼hrer, and accepts a political post in Berlin. At first the doctor does nothing as his friends "disappear", but eventually, with the aid of an engineer, he creates a secret radio station from which he broadcasts condemnations of Hitler and prays for a "better" Germany to arise from the ashes of his ruined country. The birth of "Freedom Radio" sees the creation of an underground group of anti-Nazis who regard Karl as their leader.[2][3]
