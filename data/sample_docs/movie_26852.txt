Aiyyaa

The story is about a Marathi girl Meenakshi Deshpande(Rani Mukerji) falling in love with a Tamil artist Surya (Prithviraj Sukumaran). She is a librarian at a college. She has five members in her family (including herself): A wheelchair using grandmother (Jyoti Subhash) who is blind and has gold teeth, her father who smokes four cigarettes together, her mother (Nirmiti Sawant) who is obsessed with Meenakshi's marriage, and her brother Nana (Amey Wagh) whose only love in life is dogs. To escape the craziness of her family, Meenakshi lives her life in dreams. In her dreams the only thing she's doing is dancing and enacting her favourite actresses, Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi, Juhi Chawla etc. Her colleague Maina, nicknamed "Gaga Bai" (Anita Date), is an eccentric woman who dresses up in weird ensembles inspired by pop star Lady Gaga.
Meenakshi's family is looking for a suitable groom but Meenakshi, who doesn't believe in arranged marriages, is waiting for her prince and wants her dream wedding. That's when Surya (Prithviraj) enters. Surya is an art student, and the moment Meenakshi looks at him she falls in love with his tanned skin and a mysterious fragrance emanating from him. By this time her family has found the 'right guy' Maadhav (Subodh Bhave) for her and are rushing with her wedding.
The rest of the film involves Madhav running around after Meenakshi, and Meenakshi following Surya. Nana gets engaged to Maina under bizarre circumstances when Meenakshi goes missing on her engagement date when she was following Surya and ends up in his incense sticks factory. Meenakshi learns that Surya's fragrance, that she got enthralled to, was because of his involvement in the factory. In the end, Meenakshi succeeds in winning over Surya's heart and they get engaged in a traditional Maharashtrian ceremony.
