Narendran Makan Jayakanthan Vaka

The story is about Jayakanthan (Kunchacko Boban) who comes to claim his father Narendran's property in their native village. There he meets Vinodini (Samyuktha Varma) who is the panchayat president and a strict follower of the rules. Swathi (Asin) is Jayakanthan's cousin and her father Balakrishnan Nambiar (Janardhanan) is worried that Jayakanthan has come to marry her and inherit their property. Bhargavan (Sreenivasan) has usurped Narendran's land, but Jayakanthan is unaware of this and becomes his good friend. The remaining of the plot is about how things fall into place.
