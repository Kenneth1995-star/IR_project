Suyetchai MLA

Nambirajan (Sathyaraj) and Visky (Goundamani) are best friends. Both of them are very helpful to MLA Arivudaiyan (Nassar) with all his work. Priya (Ammu), Nambirajan’s sister, loves Rakesh, a rich boy. Nambirajan and Rakesh's father Muthiah Pillai (Rajan P. Dev) prepare their engagement. In the function, Muthiah Pillai talks ill about Nambirajan’s poverty and insults him. Muthiah Pillai says he would wed his son with Nambirajan’s sister only when Nambirajan becomes a rich person. He also says he would wed his daughter (Abitha) to Nambirajan at that time. Nambirajan accepts this challenge. So he decides to stand in election as an individual party.
