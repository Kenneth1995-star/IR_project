Dagudumootha Dandakor

Rajugaru (Rajendra Prasad) is the head of a large family which consists three sons and a daughter and their respective families. Everyone get together at his house for a vacation. When the entire family goes to their temple on a given day, some ill-fated events occur. The family thinks it is because it had forgotten to perform a ritual sacrifice which involved the slaughter of a rooster known as Nani (a rooster), which was part of their poultry. This thought is fueled all the more by each family member blaming this to be the cause for all their problems both at home and at work. Rajugaru decides to sacrifice Nani in the upcoming festival, and the family rests assured that all their problems will disappear eventually after the ritual. Then, suddenly, Nani goes missing.
The members of the family are aghast at Nani's disappearance and begin searching for it. It turns out that Rajugaru's granddaughter Bangaram (Sara Arjun) hides Nani in the attic in order to save it from getting slaughtered. Bangaram loves Nani so much that she cannot stand to see it die. The rest of the story revolves around Bangaram's attempts to save Nani from being slaughtered and the family's attempts to find the rooster and performing the ritual. In doing so, the film showcases the lost values of family tradition and a child's innocent love for a rooster. The climax and ending of the movie properly light the shades of character shown as dark earlier.
