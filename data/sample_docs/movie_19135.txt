Dance, Little Lady

Prima ballerina Nina Gordon is being financially exploited by her husband Mark (Terence Morgan). On the night of her triumphant Royal Opera House debut, she discovers he is also being unfaithful. Distraught, she leaves the party they were attending. However, Mark pulls up in their car and she gets in and he drives off at speed into the night. There is a car crash and Nina's leg is badly broken.
Learning that she'll never dance again, Nina is abandoned by Mark. But with the help of a sympathetic doctor (Guy Rolfe), Nina recovers the use of her legs, and begins to live her life vicariously through her talented daughter (Mandy Miller). When Mark reenters Nina's life, intending to take control of the daughter's dancing career, he finds the tables are turned on him.
