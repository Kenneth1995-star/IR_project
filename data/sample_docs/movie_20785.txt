Hotel

While a British film crew are shooting a version of The Duchess of Malfi in Venice, they in turn are being filmed by a sleazy documentary primadonna while the strange hotel staff share meals which consist of human meat. The story expands to involve a hit man, a call girl and the Hollywood producer.[2]
The film itself makes several mentions of the Dogme 95 style of filmmaking, and has been described as a "Dogme film-within-a-film."[3][4]
