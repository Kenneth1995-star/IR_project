Parichay

The film is about misunderstandings between a grandfather and his five grandchildren and how Ravi (Jeetendra), tutor to the grandchildren succeeds in reforming them and marrying Rama (Jaya Bhaduri), eldest of them. Ravi, being an unemployed young man immediately agrees to tutor the grandchildren of Rai Saheb (Pran), a job arranged by his uncle. His aunt tells him about how the children have made every previous tutor run away. The children led by the eldest, Rama, try to tease Ravi by using their standard tactics. To their surprise, Ravi not only takes them lightly but also supports them in front of their great aunt, Sati Devi. They gradually get closer and Ravi even takes them out regularly to play. Ravi and Rama grow close to each other. Gradually he comes to know that their father Nilesh (Sanjeev Kumar), a talented musician, married without the consent of Rai Saheb, which created acrimony between son and father, further led to Nilesh leaving his father's house forever. He faced bitter poverty with his wife and five children, which later led to the death of his wife and himself. The children became orphans and Rai Saheb brought them to his house even though they hated him. Gradually, the children understand that their parent's death wasn't the mistake of their grandfather and there lies a soft emotion for them behind his disciplinary attitude. Eventually, Rai Saheb finds out about the romance between Ravi and Rama and immediately gives his consent, not to repeat his mistake. Final credits indicate that there will be a wedding between them.
