Naattiya Rani

The story happens during the days when Kingdoms were in existence.
A swamy (hermit) teaches fine arts like music and dance from his Ashram in a village to students.
A young girl named Shanthala from the villages brings him milk every day. May be due to her seeing students training in music and dance in the ashram, Shanthala had a strange dream in which she becomes very famous. Shanthala tells about her dream to a close friend, Veni who laughs it off.
But Shanthala believes in her dream and starts worshipping Lord Shiva in a temple located outside the village. Lord Shiva appears to her and grants her wish.
In the meantime, the king of Hoysala, Vishnuvardhana, visits the Swamy. Swamy was writing a treatise on Classical dance called Natya. He sings a song while the king was listening. Shanthala starts dancing to the tune of the song exhibiting the correct mudhras perfectly. The king becomes fascinated by Shanthala's dance movements.
He meets Shanthala privately and marries her by exchanging rings. He tells her that he will take her to the palace on an auspicious day. However, the king did not tell Shanthala that he is already married.
After waiting, Shanthala goes to the palace only to find there is already a queen there. The queen, on learning about Shanthala, tries to poison and kill Shanthala.
How Shanthala escapes and then joins the king forms the rest of the story.[1]
