The March Hare

Sir Charles Hare (Terence Morgan), a dissolute Irish baronet who gambles away his ancestral home and its racing stables, decides to stay on when the new American owner's attractive daughter Pat (Peggy Cummins) mistakes him for a groom. Playing along with her mistake, romance develops between the two, as Hare helps Pat rear a colt to enter into the Derby Day competition.
