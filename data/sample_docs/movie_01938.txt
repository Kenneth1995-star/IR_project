Millions in the Air

Amateur performers on Colonel Edwards' popular radio show get a gong rung by the show's sponsor, soap mogul Calvin Keller, if they aren't any good. It doesn't surprise the audience when would-be opera singer Tony Pagano is judged a disappointment, but the act of Eddie Warren and Marion Keller wowed the crowd. Everyone is stunned when they, too, get the gong.
Marion's fianc√© Gordon Rogers dislikes her being a vaudeville entertainer. Eddie, an ice cream vendor, wants to succeed with or without her, but he's jealous when he learns of Marion's relationship with Gordon and parts ways with her. He is also irked when his pal Jimmy wins the radio contest along with his old dance partner, Bubbles.
During the next show, Keller gets so many complaints from listeners and audience members that he insists Colonel Edwards reunite the team of Eddie and Marion that very night. It takes some doing, but ultimately the twosome steals the show.
