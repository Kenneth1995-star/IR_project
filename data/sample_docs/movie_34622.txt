Days of Wrath

Chang-sik bullied Joon-seok relentlessly during high school. And his girlfriend was raped by Chang-sik and committed suicide on the next day. Fifteen years later, the two encounter each other again. Chang-sik is working for a conglomerate, and preparing for his wedding. On the other hand, because of his traumatic experience, Joon-seok has a difficult time getting a decent job even though he graduated from a prestigious university; he works part-time at a convenience store. Unable to forget, Joon-seok prepares for revenge to make Chang-sik pay.
