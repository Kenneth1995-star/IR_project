Mahamaya

Mahamaya, the Princess of the Kingdom of Gandhara and Vikram, the Prince of a neighbouring Kingdom happen to be pupils of the same teacher (Guru). Mahamaya garlands the sword of Vikram without knowing its implication. When a woman garlands a man's sword, according to the custom prevailed in those times, it is considered that she has become the wife of the sword owner. Vikram knows about her action. After they leave the Ashram of the teacher each marry a different person. Later, Vikram happens to meet Mahamaya. Reminding her that she has chosen him as her husband, he claims that she belongs to him. However, Mahamaya rejects his claim. Vikram abducts Mahamaya but she manage to escape from him. When she goes home, her husband refuses to accept her. Abandoned, Mahamaya kills her child and commits suicide.
