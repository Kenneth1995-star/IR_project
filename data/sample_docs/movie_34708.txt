Mr. Oh is in his mid-fifties and is a successful marketing executive (sangmoo or managing director) at a major cosmetics company. He struggles to juggle corporate life and preparing for a new ad campaign, while tirelessly caring for his ailing wife, whose health has steadily and painfully deteriorated in the last four years due to brain cancer. During this difficult time, Oh also becomes aware of his growing feelings for Choo Eun-joo, the much younger, alluring new addition to his marketing team. When his wife finally succumbs to her disease, Oh becomes conflicted over his profound grief and newfound passion.
