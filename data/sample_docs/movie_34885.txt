Non-Transferable

The film centres around a young woman named Amy Tyler, who books a surprise holiday to Europe with her boyfriend Josh Merit.[4] However, the two separate before they are able to go onto the trip; therefore, she advertises her tickets online in search for another man with an identical name to her ex-boyfriend to go on the tour instead.[3][1] The story, although written in 2012, bore similarities[1] to a 2014 case of a 28-year-old Toronto man named Jordan Axani, who offered up free tickets to on Reddit a girl named Elizabeth Gallagher, when he broke up with his girlfriend of the same name. Although his ticket had a strict no-transfer policy, as passport information was not required when booking, the ticket could be used by anyone with the same name.[5]
When a BuzzFeed article about the story became viral,[6] the script was given "new life".[2] Brendan Bradley said that "I wrote this script five years ago", Bradley said, "and everyone told me ... 'This would never happen! This is too unrealistic!' And the project didnâ€™t get any traction because everyone thought the premise was too crazy. And then it happened in real life."[1]
