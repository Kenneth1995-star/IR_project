Kangal Malsat

In the Bengali language, the name of the film literally translates to "War cry of the Beggars". The film shows two imaginary groups of contemporary Bengal- Fyataru: Flying human beings; Choktor: Black Magic sect Bhodi. The head of the Choktors, initiates a total war against the ruling political party of West Bengal, India. Fyatarus join hands with Choktors. Advised by Calcutta's progenitors Dandabayash (ageless primordial talking crow) and an Indo-colonial half-breed Begum Johnson(1732-1818) erupt a historic insurrection. They jointly launch guerrilla attacks against the Government. Skulls dance in crematoria and flying-discs flutter in the skies and cry anarchy, resident ghosts gossip and prattle, and the police is in total confusion. Government is forced to surrender and offer a peace proposal to the joint force. This anarchic film dissects almost everything wrong in the city with a cinematic knife sharpened on trenchant farce and fantasy.[1] The film was also in controversy because of a particular sex scene where swapna sio was shown nude and having explicit sex with a ruling party minister. The scene showed her nude backside and engaging in fellatio and anal sex. This scene was leaked through a MMS and was misinterpreted as Swapna sio having a sexual affair with a real minister.
