Kimmy Dora: Ang Kiyemeng Prequel

Kimmy Dora: Ang Kiyemeng Prequel is set before the events of the groundbreaking first movie. Kimmy (played by Eugene Domingo), the snooty sister, just graduated summa cum laude from a posh school abroad. She expects to take over her family's worldwide business empire, but she's disappointed when she's asked to start working at the bottom of the company first.
Kimmy must also compete with Dora (also played by Eugene Domingo), her simple-minded sister who just wants to jumpstart her budding acting career. Dora might not want to work for the family business, yet she plays along because she has a major crush on their internship supervisor Rodin (Sam Milby).
While all these are happening, a mysterious entity named Bogart (Angel Aquino) is out to sabotage their business empire. Will Kimmy and Dora be able to save the company from Bogart? Who gets to head the family business? Who will win Rodin's affections?
