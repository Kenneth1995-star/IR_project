A newspaper editor mastheads an inaccurate, unverified story about the death of a doctor. Unable to prevent the print order from reaching the stands, he murders the doctor the same night. This brings him in league with a murderer and impersonator whose designs had tricked him into publishing the story in the first place. It is now left to the son of the editor's victim to avenge his father's death.[2]
