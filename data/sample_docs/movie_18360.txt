Street Song

Pet shop owner Lucy (Ren√© Ray) befriends Tom (John Garrick), a busker who is mixed up with criminals. Lucy hopes to help him by getting him a singing job on the radio, while he tries to raise money to prevent her from being evicted, but any such hopes evaporate when Tom is arrested for robbery. Lucy's young brother, Billy (John Singer), comes to their aid by inadvertently prompting the real robber (Wally Patch) to confess, and Tom is freed to pursue his singing career.
