One Jump Ahead

Reporter Paul Banner, a Canadian "noozeman", works at the Daily Comet in England. When a young boy witnesses a murder, the killer mistakenly tracks down the boy's friend and kills who he thinks is the only witness to the crime. Banner becomes interested in the murders but complications arise when Judy (Jill Adams), his ex-love becomes involved.
Banner sets out to find the killer, and has the help of Maxine (Diane Hart), another reporter who vies for his attention. Together, they ferret out who the mystery killer is, keeping "one jump ahead" of the police.
