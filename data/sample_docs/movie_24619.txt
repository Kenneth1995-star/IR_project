Himalaya Ki God Mein

Sunil Mehra (played by Manoj Kumar) completes his medical studies and becomes a doctor. He is kidnapped by dacoits in the Himalayas, harassed, and left badly hurt. Phoolwa, a villager (played by Mala Sinha), finds and takes care of him until he becomes fit. He then leaves for his home in the city.
He returns to the Himalayas to help poor people who do not have proper facilities and or medical care. Villagers resist his arrival as they do not trust his modern medicines and only believe in local healers. Worried for him, Sunil's family sends his fianc√©e Neeta (played by Shashikala) to get him back. Sunil in turn asks Neeta, who is also a doctor, to stay there with him. Firm in his decision, he stays. He falls in love with Phoolwa.
