Sardar Papa Rayudu

A sincere police officer Ramu (N. T. Rama Rao) and Vijaya (Sridevi) are in love. Vijaya’s father Dharmaraju (Rao Gopala Rao) is a corrupt politician who fakes the good gentleman image outside. He along with two more guys named Satya Murthy (Satyanarayana) and Nyayapathi (Allu Ramalingaiah) exploited the poor by joining hands with the British. When Dharmaraju meets Ramu with his daughter, he immediately goes back to his past. Dharmaraju, Satya Murthy, Nyayapathi kills a king Vijayaraghavaraju (Prabhakar Reddy) in Andaman islands and throws the crime over a sincere gentleman and a great freedom fighter Sardar Paparayudu (again N. T. Rama Rao). Sardar Paparayudu gets a life sentence. The reason why Dharmaraju is shocked seeing Ramu because the latter exactly resembles Sardar Paparayudu in facial features. In fact, Ramu is the son of Sardar Paparayudu. Ramu’s mother Seeta (Sharada) is the wife of Sardar Paparayudu. Right from then, Dharmaraju gets terrified and to make things for him worse, Sardar Paparayudu gets released from jail as a result of reducing the imprisonment. He decides to take revenge on Dharmaraju for wrongly imprisoning him and a rift starts between him and his son Ramu. The film ends on a happy note with justice eventually winning.
