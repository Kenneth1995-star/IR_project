Kozhi Koovuthu

Kumaresan (Ashok) and his gang of friends, going around villages, selling chicken. They con the simple villagers into believing the common chicken they sell, to be imported breeds. The whole group is happy-go-lucky, and don't worry much about the future. Thulasi (Shija Rose), who is living at her aunt's house after moving away from her father, buys 2 chicks from Kumaresan. When they end up dead the next day, she corners him and demands an explanation. Kumaresan gives 2 more chicks as replacement, and later, when a group of villagers tie up Kumaresan and beat him for cheating them by selling them sick chicken, Thulasi saves him from the group. On learning of Kumaresan's family, and the hardships he has faced, she develops a soft corner for him. In due course, this turns to love. Just as everything is progressing smoothly, Thulasi's ruffian uncle whisks her off to her native village for a festival, which later forms the crux of the story.
