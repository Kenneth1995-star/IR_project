The Avenger

In 1849, Joaquin Murietta (Buck Jones) is determined to track down the three men, Black Kelly (Otto Hoffman), Ike Mason (Edward Peil Sr.) and Al Goss (Walter Percival), who lynched his brother. As "The Black Shadow," he robs the rich, gives to the poor, and romances the new school teacher Helen Lake (Dorothy Revier).[2]
