Lakhon Ki Baat

Sports photographer Alok Prakash (Farooq Shaikh) is shooting a female field hockey game when he's hit with a stray ball. Prakash is hospitalized but only suffers from minor injuries, though his enterprising brother-in-law, Prem Sagar (Sanjeev Kumar), sees an opportunity to make some easy money. Sagar, a lawyer, asks Prakash to exaggerate his injury so he can file a lawsuit and they can live off the settlement. Soon, the whole family is involved, and Prakash and Sagar find the ruse hard to keep up.
