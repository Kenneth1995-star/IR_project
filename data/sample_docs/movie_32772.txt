Rarandoi Veduka Chudham

The story begins in a village as a tale of three best friends Krishna (Jagapathi Babu), Adi Narayana (Sampath Raj), and Prabhakar (Irshad). Adi Narayana has a huge family, and one day, his elder sister Priya (Priya) gets engaged. Ten days before her wedding, she elopes, leaving behind a letter that she has loved another man, and has gone to live with him. Due to some misunderstanding, Krishna is suspected, and the friendship turns into enmity.
The story moves forward twenty five years, with Bhrahmaramba (Rakul Preet Singh), the innocent and heavily pampered only daughter of Adi Narayana, who has little to no exposure to the outside world. She dreams of getting married to a groom who has the qualities of a prince, as said by her grandmother. Siva (Naga Chaitanya), the son of Krishna, meets Bhrahmaramba in his brother Kishore's (Vennela Kishore) marriage with Bhramarambha's friend and falls in love with her at first sight. After playful encounters, they separate ways. Bhramarambha eventually comes to Vizag, Siva's hometown, for her studies. She quickly finds out that Siva lives in Vizag and they spend a lot of time together, with her sharing everything with him. She tells him that she is not interested in a relationship with him. Siva loves her, but in fear of rejection , doesn't reveal his love. Later they get into an argument, with Siva revealing his love for her and being frustrated on her not having a clarity on her life and that she keeps waiting for a prince and doesn't realize what she has. Bhramarambha furiously returns home, and accepts a marriage proposal by her cousin out of anger. Rest of the story is how Siva finally makes Brahmaramba realize him as her Prince and resolves disputes between both families.
