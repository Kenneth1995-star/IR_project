Daivathinte Swantham Cleetus

Daivathinte Swantham Cleetus tells the story of a "thug" named Cleetus (Mammootty) who is asked by a parish priest (Siddique), who does not know about his background, to play the role of Jesus Christ in a play. During the film, events in the life of Cleetus start to mirror events portrayed about Jesus' life in the Bible.
