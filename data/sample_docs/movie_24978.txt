Ginny Aur Johnny

The story is of a man named Johnny (Mehmood) and a nine year old girl Ginny who is Mehmood's daughter. Ginny's mother Rosie (Hema Malini) dies in an accident and Ginny is left alone. Johnny comes to visit Rosie and during this time he comes to know about her death. Thus, her villagers request Johnny to take Ginny into an orphanage at Ooty.
On the other hand, Johnny who is a con man, visits those places where somebody had died and by taking their names, he sells holy books to the families. While travelling to Ooty, he continues his work. The journey consists of beautiful slapstick events and how they banter with each other.
