Zalzala

The narrator starts the movie with a myth that there is a hidden golden temple full of treasures. None can reach there without the map and one old priest only knows the way to the temple. In the other side of the story, Inspector Shiv Kumar arrested dacoit Sona Singh, who is madly in search of that hidden temple. Sona Sing broke jail and killed Shiv's wife Radha. Radha was an orphan and it is revealed later that she was the only sister of Shankar (Man with no name). In another occasion inspector Shiv met with one vagabond Bholey and Radha's brother Shankar. To take revenge of Radha's death, Shiv Kumar resigned the police service and chased Sona Singh's gang, but unfortunately was captured by them. Sona Singh told him to guide them to the hidden golden temple, because only Shiv knows the map of the area. The old man informed Shiv about the path to the temple before his death. The full gang of dacoit and Shiv started a hard journey towards the temple. Shankar, Bholey and their respective fiancee also accompanied Shiv.
