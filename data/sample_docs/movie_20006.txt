What's Good for the Goose

Norman Wisdom plays a 50-something assistant bank manager called Timothy Bartlett whose working life and marriage in London have become lacklustre. On his way to a bankers' conference in Southport, he gives a lift to two fun-loving female students, and has a brief affair with one of them, Nikki (Sally Geeson). He abandons his work responsibilities to have a perfect day with her, taking in all the seaside amusements and recapturing his youthful energy. He tells her he has fallen in love with her and rents a 'love nest' for them, only to find out he was just a two-day novelty for her and she has already moved on to someone her own age. So he invites his wife to join him at the resort and takes her to the places Nikki uses, apparently to show her he's fine without her. They replicate the perfect day he had with Nikki, finding he can have (almost) as much enjoyment with his wife.
