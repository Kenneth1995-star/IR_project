Nanbanin Kadhali

Jeeva (Vikramaditya Shukla) who takes up residence in Sujata (Shivani Singh)'s neighbourhood, falls for her ample charms. Jeeva's attempts to woo Sujata misfires, landing him on the wrong side of her father (Vinu Chakravarthy), a retired military man. Enters into the scene Surya (Kunal Singh). Surya's smooth talking ways and pleasing manners charm Sujata and her family. In the game of one-upmanship and misunderstandings, who finally gets the girl forms the finale.[1]
