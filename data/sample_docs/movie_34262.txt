The Heritage of Love

The film is set in 2016. Andrey Kulikov is a young machinist who is going to Paris to visit an old lady, and to buy the oldest Russian-made car, the Russo-Balt. While walking through Paris, Andrey sees a woman, Vera, and so starts the tale of two love stories, separated by three generations and one hundred years.
Later, when Andrey visits a cemetery he finds the grave of a young lady similar to the one he just met in Paris.
During his search to the past it becomes clear that Vera's and Andrey's fates are connected. His great-grandfather, Andrey Dolmatov, had been an officer in the White Army during the Russian Revolution and felt in love with Duchess Vera Chernisheva in the last days of the Russian Empire and in the Russian civil war.
