Seth Laxmi Narayan and his wife had a son who was separated at an early age. The only clue they have is that he has a locket around his neck. When Laxmi Narayan passes away, he leaves behind a lot of money and wealth. His wife makes efforts to locate her long-lost son, with the help of her relative, Durjan Singh. Durjan Singh hires a local thug, Birju, and asks him to pose as the long-lost son, for a hefty price, to which he agrees. Mrs. Narayan welcomes Birju as her son, and accepts him, little knowing his agenda, and the evil scheme devised by Durjan Singh and his son.
