Mr. India

Gulu Lala lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with his parents in Chinchpokli, Bombay. Believing himself to be Hindustani and speaking Hindi, he is unable to secure employment with Parsi, Sindhi, Marwari, and Tamil businessmen, and spends his time walking a stray dog, Charlie, along Marine Drive. One day, he comes to the rescue of Sindhi-speaking wealthy businessman, Rai Bahadur Himmatchand and his snobbish daughter, Bembi, who initially "borrow" Charlie and then Gullu himself to live in their mansion. Eventually, the couple get attracted to each other - little knowing that soon their respective lives will be changed drastically when Gullu will be mistaken for a look-alike gangster named Jung Bahadur, while a disapproving Himmatchand is all set to get his daughter married to a wealthy man named Kamal Jeet.
