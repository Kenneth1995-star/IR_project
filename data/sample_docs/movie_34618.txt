Queen of the Night

Young-soo is a nerdy, timid man without any interest in women until he meets Hee-joo in a sandwich store one day. They get married and at first, the couple settles into a happy marriage. She But three years later when by chance, at the reunion for his university class, the allure of winning a kimchi-fridge for her mother-in-law makes her dance a super-sexy show, the shockingly surprised Young-soo begins to doubt his seemingly perfect wife and does some digging into her past. To his dismay he discovers plenty of evidence that her past isn't as pristine as he thought. This begins to deepen the question of how this nerdy computer technician with ordinary looks and no social skills could have married such a beautiful woman who seems happily content as a sort of Stepford Wife male fantasy, the perfect virgin/whore who submissively cleans his ears but surprises him one night in a Naughty Nurse outfit and then plays it out.
