Cinderella

Masha Krapivina (Kristina Asmus) comes to Moscow from Lipetsk. She studies at an institute and works as a maid for a rich family, where she has to please the mean-spirited mistress Lyudmila (Margarita Bychkova) and her two daughters: Polina (Elizaveta Boyarskaya) and Ksenia (Anna Sherling).
Meanwhile, the maid has a crush on the famous singer Alexis Korolevich (Artyom Tkachenko). Learning that the host family is going to a private party with his participation, Masha is ready to do anything to see her idol. Her aunt Agniya Bordo (Nonna Grishayeva), editor-in-chief of "Yellow PRESS", comes to her aid. She is ready to give her an invitation, but only with the condition that she fulfills a journalistic task.
