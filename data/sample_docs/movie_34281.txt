After You're Gone

Famous ballet dancer Alexey Temnikov (Sergey Bezrukov) dedicated his whole life to the stage, performing in various halls around the world. The press referred to him as "genius of dance" and compared him with Mikhail Baryshnikov.
But in the 1990s, Temnikov suffered a serious spinal injury, which interrupted his dancing career. Alexey returned to his native town in the suburbs with a population of 70 thousand people and opened his own dance school-studio and an apothecary business.
After 20 years, Alexey's life does not change, he still lives in his hometown, where he teaches dance. He has a girlfriend named Marina (Karina Andolenko), who is pregnant with his child. Also, Alexey finds out that he has a 12 year old daughter Chiara, who wants Alexey to teach her dance. But Alexey does not show any initiative in marriage or being a father. After teaching his dance classes, Alexey locks himself up in his office, where he regularly asks himself: "What will be left from me after I'm gone?".
But soon the old trauma, once again makes itself felt. He finds out that soon he will not even be able to walk, which to Alexey is the same as death.
Sometime ago he created an original ballet set to Prokofiev's music, but did not yet have the courage make a public performance out of it. Alexey becomes convinced that now is the time for him to make a comeback and to stage the ballet.
