Military Raaj

Military Raaj is an action flick, where Mithun plays the lead role.
Mithun is an army major Anand, who fights to avoid crimes when there are crime situations, for which he is often blamed by police, stating that the army has no power to fight crimes and it is the duty of the police. Politicians who are backing up crimes transfer him to a training camp with undisciplined cadets, as the head of the camp. There he trains the cadets to become honest soldiers. In a terrible situation in which police could not keep the peace and crimes have overwhelmed the police, the government has no other option other than confining the police to barracks and calling the army to take over the security of the country i.e. forming a Military Raaj (Military controlled state).
