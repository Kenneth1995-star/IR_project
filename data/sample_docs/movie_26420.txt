Former Olympic medallist boxer Baldev Choudhary (Dharmendra) is disgraced while competing for the World Heavy weight championship when a betting syndicate falsely accuses him of drug doping. He tries to erase this stain upon his honour by training up his son, Angad (Sunny Deol) but financial difficulties keep them from achieving his dream. He trains a local boy to get into a media hyped TV boxing show, but is dropped for a better coach at the last minute. Baldev's younger son Karan (Bobby Deol) has just launched his first music album. Realising his father is depressed, he gives up his own dream of a musical career to become a boxer and please his father. Karan persists with training and wins a series of fights, thinking that victory will bring his family together. The final match is with the current world heavy champion; Karan is tricked and he ends up paralysed in a hospital bed. Baldev, who wanted to wash a stigma is now about to lose his son. When Karan reveals the world heavy champion cheated, Angad decides to return to boxing and win the title for his father. He eventually brings the world heavyweight champion belt to India in triumph, however meanwhile Karan suffers liver damage and requires a liver to survive. A guilt stricken Baldev pleads with the doctors to use his liver, but the doctors reject the idea. In a stroke of luck, a liver is given to Karan through an unknown donor. In the end, Baldev who was going to give up his life for Karan, is instead alive and happy with his family.
