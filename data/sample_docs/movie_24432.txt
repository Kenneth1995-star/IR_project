Ek Hi Rasta

The film starts with the portrayal of happily married couple, Amar (Sunil Dutt) and Malti (Meena Kumari) who have a son named Raja (Daisy Irani). Amar and Malti are both orphans and hence are sympathetic towards orphans generally. Prakash (Ashok Kumar) is a rich bachelor businessman for whom Amar works. While working in Prakash's factory, Amar catches another worker Munshi (Jeevan) stealing money from the factory locker.
To take revenge for his humiliation at the hands of Amar, Munshi murders him. To escape his depression over the loss, Prakash begins helping Malti and her child. Munshi tries to humiliate the family by spreading rumours of an affair between Prakash and Malti in public. To save the honour of Malti, Prakash marries her. Raja meanwhile refuses to accept Prakash as his father. Munshi provokes Raja against Prakash and claims that Prakesh was the real murderer of Amar. Out of anger, Raja tries to shoot Prakash but fails. Raja is jailed for the attempt to kill Prakash. After a few years, Raja is released from jail only to find that his mother is hospitalised from the mental shock she received following Raja's imprisonment. Fearing Malti has died, Raja does not return home. After a few years, Raja understands and returns home, then accepts Prakash as his father.[4]
