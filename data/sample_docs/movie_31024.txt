Drohi

Sami Srinivasan (Srikanth), a Brahmin boy and his friend Karunakaran (Vishnu Vishal) grow up in the slums of Royapuram and attend the same school. Karuna is a rough and tough boy and Sami is bit naive. They are close buddies.
Once they see their class teacher Roja (Pooja Umashanker) brutally murdered before their eyes by a gangster. Dejected at local police not taking any action, Karuna kills him but is caught by cops. Sami tells the police it was Karuna who committed the murder.
Though both are bailed out of trouble, enmity brews between them. As years roll, hatred increases. Sami is against Karuna. Trouble erupts when Sami loves Karuna's sister Malar (Shamna Kasim). In the meantime, Shruthi (Poonam Bajwa) loves Karuna. What happens between the two forms the rest of the film.
