Mogudu Kaavali

Krishna (Gayatri) is inherited with lots of wealth from her father, but he imposes a condition that she should marry in order to inherit that wealth. Krishna doesn’t want to marry a prince who might later turn out to be a toad, especially after seeing her friend Shanthi’s marital life experience. But, she needs her father’s wealth. So, she hires Chiru as her hire husband and tries to get all her father’s wealth. But, to her surprise and shock, chiru turns out to be far more than she had bargained for! How chiru transforms her forms the rest of the story.
