Pangaaligal

Three poor men (Ranga Rao, Sarangkapani and Muthaiah) get together, form a partnership and establish a metal vessel factory. Rao gets hold of the authority and make the other two as wage earners. Rao's son (Radha) goes abroad for studies and comes back as a fully westernized man. He marries the daughter (Anjali Devi) of one of the wage earners as agreed upon earlier. But he is not interested in her and ill-treats her. The son of that wage earner (Gemini Ganesan) goes to Malaysia to learn a trade. When he returns he finds that his sister is married to Radha and undergoes ill-treatment. The other wage earner had two daughters. One of them, (Saroja) is lost during a festival and was brought up by a railway porter (Durairaj and family. They make her a dancer so as to exploit rich men. They get hold of Radha. The other daughter (Devika) and Ganesan become lovers. The porter family swindles all his wealth from Radha and he is reduced to living in a hut. He realizes his folly. Ganesan helps to sort out matters and all ends well.[3]
