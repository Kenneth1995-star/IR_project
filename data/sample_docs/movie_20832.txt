The Mother

May (played by Anne Reid) is an ordinary grandmother from Northern England. When her elderly husband dies on a family visit to London, she recedes into the background of her busy, metropolitan children's lives. Trapped in an unfamiliar city, far from home, May fears that she has become another invisible older woman whose life is more or less over; she embarks on a sexual affair with Darren (Daniel Craig), a much younger, married handyman who is renovating her son's house and who is also her daughter's lover. As her sexual desire turns into emotional longing, May unwittingly embroils herself in a point-of-no-return situation, with devastating results for all those surrounding her.
