Pavitra Paapi

The shooting was done at Jind city in Haryana. Pannalal is employed in a clock repair shop owned by Lala Attarchand and is replaced by Kedarnath, who comes to the town of Punjab in search of such work, as according to him, his ancestors were in the same business.
On this, Pannalal curses him as being the cause of his family becoming destitute and writes a letter to him saying that this has driven him to suicide and disappears. Kedarnath is guilt-ridden and goes out of his way to help his wife Maya, and his two daughters, Veena and Vidya. Kedarnath rents a room with them, writes letters to her on behalf of her husband and teaches Veena during his free time, making him fall in love with her.
But when Maya tells him that Veena's marriage is already arranged, he helps in the marriage of Veena with the son of Daulatram. When Maya tells him that she has no money to pay for the marriage expenses, he steals cash from his employer, and tells Maya that the money is from Pannalal. He then goes away from the village.
Veena's in-laws turn out to be rogues, except for her father-in-law, who counsels his family that they should not torture the daughter of somebody. Meanwhile, Pannalal returns to his family and visits Veena's in-laws to find her in agony and brings her back.
Kedar, who now lives in Delhi, regularly sends money orders to repay his debt to Lala Attarchand. Pannalal finds out Kedar's whereabouts and requests him to come back and save dying Veena. But Kedar instead makes Veena's Husband realize his mistakes and unites the pair without appearing in person. The film ends with Kedarnath going away.
