The Cheyenne Social Club

In 1867, John O'Hanlan and Harley Sullivan are aging cowboys working on open cattle ranges in Texas. O'Hanlan gets a letter from an attorney in Cheyenne, Wyoming, that his disreputable and now deceased brother, DJ, left him something called The Cheyenne Social Club in his will.
After making the 1,000 mile (1,600Â km) trek to Cheyenne, O'Hanlan and Sullivan learn The Cheyenne Social Club is a high-class brothel next to the railroad. O'Hanlan's efforts to close the Club are thwarted, so O'Hanlan has his brother's lawyer transfer ownership of the Club to Jenny, and he leaves town again, with Sullivan in tow.
