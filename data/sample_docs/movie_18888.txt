Meet Simon Cherry

When the Rev. Simon Cherry (Hugh Moxey) sets off for a much needed holiday, his car breaks down and he is forced to stay overnight in a manor house belonging to Lady Harling (Courtney Hope). The following morning, the body of Lady Harling's invalid daughter (Jeanette Tregarthen) is discovered, apparently murdered, and the Rev. Simon Cherry must bring his crime solving skills to the case.
