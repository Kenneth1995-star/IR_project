Extraordinary Measures

Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell play John Crowley and his wife, Aileen, a Portland couple with two of their three children suffering from Pompe disease, a genetic anomaly that typically kills most before a child's tenth birthday. John, an advertising executive, contacts Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford), a researcher in Nebraska who has done innovative research for an enzyme treatment for the rare disease. John and Aileen raise money to help Stonehill's research and the required clinical trials. John takes on the task full-time to save his children's lives, launching a biotechnology research company working with venture capitalists and then rival teams of researchers. This task proves very daunting for Stonehill, who already works around the clock. As time is running short, Stonehill's angry outburst hinders the company's faith in him, and the profit motive may upend John's hopes. The researchers race against time to save the children who have the disease.
