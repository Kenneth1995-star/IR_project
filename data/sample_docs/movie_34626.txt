Steel Cold Winter

Yoon-soo was once a student at one of the best high schools in Seoul, but a trivial remark he made turns into a vicious rumor that leads his friend to commit suicide. Unable to bear the guilt, Yoon-soo attempts to kill himself. To help him recover, his family moves to Ijeon-li, a snow-covered village on a mountain. On the day of the move, Yoon-soo sees a mysterious young girl skating by herself on the frozen lake. Having started school in this small, rural town, Yoon-soo slowly finds peace within. Despite the villagers' kindness and his peers' ongoing fascination with him as a cool guy from the city, he keeps to himself. There is, however, one girl who gets Yoon-soo's attention: the class outcast Hae-won. The aloof Hae-won, who lives alone with her mentally disabled father, is viewed as pariah by the entire village and constantly at the center of the townsfolk's gossip. As if seeing himself in her, he offers her sympathy and warmth, and Hae-won slowly opens up to him, feeling that he's the only one who understands and accepts her. But soon, Yoon-soo also becomes consumed by the brutal rumors surrounding Hae-won.
