Hold That Hypnotist

The Bowery Boys' landlady Mrs. Kelly believes in a theory proposed by Dr. Simon Noble that through hypnosis, one can regress into a former life, or lives, from the past. Sach is hypnotized and recounts stories from several past lives. Evidently Sach once lived as Algy Winkle, an English tax collector in Charleston, South Carolina. Winkle managed to get a map from the famous pirate Captain Blackbeard leading to buried treasure, which becomes the focal point of the story.
