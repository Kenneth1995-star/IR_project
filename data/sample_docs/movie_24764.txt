Dharti

Vasantpur is a small princely state adjacent to India. It is ruled by a kind king (Pahari Sanyal), but his general, Diwan (Ajit), who is a cruel man, is planning to take over Vasantpur with the help of Dutch powers. Meanwhile, the King's Inspector General Chandrashekhar (Balraj Sahni)'s son, Bharat (Rajendra Kumar) gets his higher education from Switzerland. There, he meets the King's daughter, Jwala (Waheeda Rehman) alias Chitralekha. They both fall in love. After some time, Bharat gets a message from his fellow friends that Vasantpur is falling into the clutches of cruel Diwan and he hurries to Vasantpur with Jwala. Following their adventures, they take Dikky (Rajendranath) and Rosey (Kumkum) under their wing. When their two attempts to kill Diwan are foiled, they devise a plan to kill Diwan in his own palace. But the cruel Diwan has imprisoned Chandrashekhar and the King and is going to become Vasantpur's king. Now what does fate have in store for Bharat and all of Vasantpur?
