Neighbours: They Are Vampires

Sanam is a horror buff, she has horror films and literature filling up her room, much to the annoyance of her family. Therefore, she is shocked to find out that vampires (who are on a killing spree in the city) have made their abode opposite her house.
Nobody believes Sanam, when she tells everyone that her neighbours are vampires. Not her family nor her friends, even her professor doesn't pay attention to her.
