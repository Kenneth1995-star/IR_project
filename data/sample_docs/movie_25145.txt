Dhuaan

Sunil Verma is asked by his boss to impersonate dead Ashok Saxena and steal secret national documents, jewels and gold statues from Devigarh estate. Ashok Saxena, a race car driver, is the younger brother of Rani Gayatri Saxena's dead husband, who was the high commissioner in Manila. In Devigarh, only Gayatri knows Ashok on sight. Sunil has been briefed well by his boss. Ashok's picture with Gayatri has been replaced by Sunil's. She is unable to prove that Sunil is a fake and asks Sheela (Ashok's ex-fiance) to come as she too knows Ashok by face. Sheela and her father are stopped on their way to Devigarh by Sunil's boss with his subordinates. She is asked to travel alone with Sunil's colleague as driver and identify Sunil as Ashok, else her father would be in trouble. Sheela obliges and the driver stays back in Devigarh. Sunil matches Ashok's racing skills. Gayatri is frustrated.
