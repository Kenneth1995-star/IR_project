Classmates Rajesh and Manju are in love with each other and their marriage is on card. But Manju's rich neighbor Jwalaprasad's daughter Lata, a spoiled lady, also wants to marry Rajesh. Manju's father falls ill of a stomach tumor, but she does not have the Rs.5000 required for an operation. Unfortunately, Rajesh is out of station for some work. She goes to Jwalaprasad for help and finds his wife at home, who gives her money, but on a condition. Manju should accept unmarried Lata's illicit child as her own and should never disclose the truth to anyone. Helpless, Manju agrees. But that money could not save her father, who succumbs to his illness. Manju leaves the vicinity. Rajesh finds her after a couple of years with the kid and accuses her of deceiving him. He turns alcoholic. Jwalaprasad finds Manju and brings her at his home to serve Mrs. Jwalaprasad, who is a mute handicapped now because of an accident. Jwalaprasad asks Manju to convince Rajesh to marry Lata. Upon Manju's insistence, Rajesh agrees. During the marriage rituals, Lata's house catches fire and Lata & her kid are trapped in. Rajesh saves them, but Lata dies of an injury when she tries to stop Rajesh. Shocked, Mrs. Jwalaprasad regains her voice and tells all about her atrocities on Manju, to everyone. Rajesh and Manju are united again.
