However, he restricts her a lot after the marriage. Sita's brother Bangaram (Chalam) comes from the town and eyes Bangari (Reshmi Roy), Kanakayya's deaf and dumb servant Devudu's (Chandramohan) sister. Bangari is in love with Narasimha (Chiranjeevi), another servant of Kanakayya. Bangaram rapes Bangari. Kanakayya suspects that Sita is in love with Devudu, and in a fit of rage, he kills them both one day. People revolt against Kanakayya and kill him at the end.
