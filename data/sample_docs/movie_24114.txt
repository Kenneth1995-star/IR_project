Kidnapper

The story revolves around three friends who stay together in a rented house. Bubka (Samadarshi Dutt) is an aspiring artist who comes to Kolkata from the suburbs. He does odd jobs for a living. He lies to his nagging girlfriend Koel (Ridhima Ghosh) that he is a sales executive, simply to impress her. Koel constantly doubts Bubka and can't stand him talking to any other girl. Bubka is joined by two of his old friends (Sourav Chatterjee and Apurbo Roy), who also come to the city looking for jobs. They decide to stay at the same rented place, owned by an old man, Bulu-da (Paran Bandyopadhyay). As days pass by, Bubka and his friends fail to find employment. One day an angry Bulu-da shows his disapproval of their stay without paying the rent for months together. He prods them to go out and earn, even kidnap if they wish to earn quick bucks. Confused and threatened, Bubka's two friends end up kidnapping four kids — one girl and three boys. All hell breaks loose when they discover one of the boys to be Koel's nephew. Bubka and Bulu-da are furious at their foolishness. However, they try their best to keep the kids safe — away from prying eyes. In no time, the children become a part of the household and began to enjoy there. They simply refuse to go home even when Bubka insists that they should. Later on, the three friends get success in their professional lives as well . The rest of the film also includes a real life comic kidnapper, 'Top Up Bhai' (Shantilal Mukherjee) who intends to kidnap the 3 children, but ends up being caught himself.[1]
