Rajeshwar is the only son of Dharamraj, who is an industrialist, and partners with Naglingam Reddy, Nagendra, and Dhanraj. Rajeshwar then meets a girl from a poor family, Bharati, who happens to be his school teacher's daughter and falls in love with her. Bharati's father is Vishnupratap, a schoolteacher, who is really unhappy, for he is unable to earn enough money to feed his family and provide them with basic amenities. He and other teachers work in the school managed by Dharamraj. The fund management headed by Dhanraj has been for years without giving any hike in fees to teachers making them work. When Rajeshwar comes to know of this, he starts confronting each lie of the partners. Bharati has a neighbor, Tilak, who is unemployed, and lives with his mother, Sharda, who works as a maidservant in Dhanraj's house. Later he gets the job of a manager in Dharamraj industries and starts obstructing nearly all the criminal activities carried out by the three partners. Rajeshwar gets impressed with the sincerity of Tilak. Meanwhile, Tilak falls in love with the Dhanraj's daughter, Rani. Dharamraj accidentally meets Sharda and he realizes that Tilak is his long-lost nephew. Dharamraj tells Rajeshwar the history of his family and how Tilak is related to him. Then Dharamraj is killed, and the evidence points towards Tilak and he has to gather evidence to prove his innocence.
