Happy, Big Eye and Puddin Lai are good friends, Happy is a hairstylist who opens his "Great Grass Hair Salon" next to the "Great Shanghai Hair Salon", which dissatisfies Greater Shanghai's owner, Chuk Tai-chung. While the two are at loggerheads on the occasion, Chuk's daughter, Ying, goes to Great Grass Hair Salon and the three friends do their best to pursue her. One time during a drunk accident, Ying becomes pregnant but does not know who the father is and can only wait the birth of her child to confirm the identity. Happy, Big Eye and Puddin begin to fawn Ying and her family in every possible way, resulting in a series of big jokes.
