Ooruku Nooruper

Balan, a young artist, becomes a part of "Ooruku Nooruper", a revolutionary organisation. To promote the ideals of the group, he becomes a modern-day Robinhood, as looting becomes an integral part of his life. Anandan, a leftist freelance writer, supports Balan and runs a campaign against capital punishment. Being a part of a revolutionary group, Balan finds no time for his family. His wife Saroja feels she is alienated from her husband. In the meanwhile, Balan accidentally kills a priest while attempting a robbery and is sentenced to death. The organisation when gets to know this, ignores him and goes on with its activities as it believes cause more important than an individual.
