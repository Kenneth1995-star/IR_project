Shatruvu

Ashok (Venkatesh) is an advocate who works as a junior along with his two friends Raghava (Maharshi Raghava) & Bhaskar for advocate Durga Prasad (Vijay Kumar) who always fights for Justice. Durga Prasad and his wife Lakshmi (Sangeetha) treat them as their own children. Venkataratnam (Kota Srinivasa Rao) is a powerful contractor who has the entire system in his hands. Once Venkataratnam cheats Govt by saying that he has constructed the hostel for poor people without doing it, just showing on papers. Durga Prasad takes up the case and gathers all the proofs against him. Venkataratnam threatens Durga Prasad a lot who does not yield to it. Finally, Venkataratnam kills Durga Prasad and his wife Lakshmi in front of the court and destroys all the evidence. Before dying, Durga Prasad takes a word from Ashok, that he should win this case under any circumstances. Ashok gives respect to his words and takes up the case, but he fails to get the case admitted because there is no evidence. In that frustration, Ashok reacts on Venkataratnam publicly in court. Finally, he is suspended from the court and arrested.
Now Ashok decides to take revenge against Venkataratnam and gang. He eliminates Venkataratnam's men one by one which creates fear to Venkataratnam. So he sends his henchmen DIG Prakash Rao (Captain Raju) to handover the case to ACP Vijaya (Vijayashanti), who is none other than Ashok's lover in college days. Both of them challenge each other. Ashok challenges to complete his mission while Vijaya challenges that she will stop him in any circumstances. During the process, Vijaya finds out that DIG works for Venkataratnam and collects all the proof for Venkatratnam's arrest. When she gets ready to arrest them, they plan to kill her. Ashok comes to her rescue and eliminates Venkataratnam & his entire gang. Finally, Ashok successfully completes his mission and movie ends.
