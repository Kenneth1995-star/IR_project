Tiger

The story begins with Vishnu (Rahul Ravindran) being chased by goons on the banks of Ganga river in Varanasi. While he is trying to escape, his bike gets hit by a car and gets severely hurt in the accident. While he is fighting with death, he narrates the story of his love and friendship.
Vishnu is an orphan and Tiger (Sundeep Kishan) is his best friend in the orphanage. Tiger does anything for his friend Vishnu. Vishnu falls in love with a girl called Ganga from Banaras Hindu University who attends the symposium. Misunderstandings occur in between Tiger and Vishnu due to Ganga and Vishnu asks Tiger not to meet him anymore. Eventually Vishnu lands in problems while trying to elope with Ganga and get married to her. Vishnu is seen and taken to hospital by a person (Saandip) passing by that road in a new car. Before undertaking surgery in the hospital, Vishnu says Tiger's phone number to doctors and they try to reach Tiger. The rest of the story is all about how Tiger saves Vishnu and unites him with Ganga.
