Detour

Young law student Harper blames his powerful stepfather Vincent for causing the car accident that put his mother in a coma. One evening in a bar he drinks with the professional criminal Johnny Ray, who agrees to solve the problem with his stepfather for $20,000. Johnny Ray and his girlfriend Cherry arrive the next morning to take Harper to Vegas to carry out the murder, unaware that Harper has already taken matters into his own hands. The trip to Las Vegas becomes a battle of wits and determination between Johnny Ray, who has debts to pay along the way, and Harper, who seeks to conceal his own crimes and to escape from Johnny Ray with Cherry.
