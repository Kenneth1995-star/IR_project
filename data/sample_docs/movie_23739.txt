Sara

After being sexually abused as a child by her stepfather, Sara (Choi) runs away from home, earns her own keep and spends her nights in various locales, including country parks and fast-food joints that stay open 24 hours. While hanging around the Tsim Sha Tsui East promenade late one evening, she meets the gentlemanly, middle-aged Kam Ho-yin (Simon Yam Tat-wah). The two embark on a complex relationship that involves his getting her into a good school and a new life she chooses to take.
