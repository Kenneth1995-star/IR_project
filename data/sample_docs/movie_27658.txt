Journalist

Ranjini Menon (Sithara), a gold medal winner in journalism arrives back in Kochi from Delhi. She starts living with her brother advocate Venu Menon(Saikumar)'s family and joins Malayalam news paper Kerala Today as an investigative journalist. She meets sub-editor Unnikrishnan (Jagadeesh), a shy young man. Unnikrishnan immediately falls for Ranjini but fails to reveal his feelings. Ranjini also meets Managing Director of the newspaper, Vishwanathan (Siddique) who is a widower. Ranjini becomes close with Vishwanathan's family, particular with his daughter. This prompts Vishwanathan to consider proposing to Ranjini.
As an investigative journalist, Ranjini publishes articles against the proposed chemical factory. This angers the factory owner business man Sharmaji (Narendraprasad). One night Sharmaji's hinge men tries to capture Ranjini in the street, but she is saved by an I.P.S officer Jayachandran(Jayaram) who has been suspended from service. It turns out that Sharamaji was earlier arrested by Jayachandran for smuggling spirit; but Jayachandran's superior officer (K. P. A. C. Sunny) and minister (T. P. Madhavan) conspired against him with Jayachandran suspended from service and Sharmaji released. Ranjini, along with Unnikrishnan and Jayachandran sets out on an investigative mission on Sharmaji. Jayachandran also develops feelings for Ranjini.
The rest of the story is the fight with Sharmaji and company on one side and Ranjini along with Vishwanathan, Jayachandran and Unnikrishnan on the other side.
