Seethalakshmi (Latha) is the owner of a clothing company, she is a haughty and strict woman. Her husband Gokulakrishnan (Manivannan) is unemployed, while her son Ashok (Vignesh) works as labourer in another company. Both of them are very obedient to Seethalakshmi.
Seethalakshmi would like an equally submissive daughter-in-law so that she will not influence her son, but Gokulakrishnan has another planÂ : he wants his son to marry a woman that he really loves. Gokulakrishnan incites his son to fall in love. As his wish, Ashok falls in love with Nila (Raasi) who works in his mother's company and Nila also reciprocates his feelings. Nila has no parents and she was brought up by her grandmother (Shanmugasundari). They then secretly get married with the blessing of Gokulakrishnan. Ashok and Gokulakrishnan decide to hide the secret marriage from Seethalakshmi. Ashok is now living a double life as an unmarried submissive son and as a happy husband, Ashok goes to his wife's home the night and returns his parents' home well before dawn. Meanwhile, Nila and Seethalakshmi become friends without knowing that they are related to each other. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
