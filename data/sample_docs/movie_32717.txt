When a group of five IT professionals decide to go trekking to a nearby forest area, they come across a sage. They chase down the sage, and to test if he holds real supernatural powers, one of them asks him to produce a newspaper, which is printed on the day after Dusshera, as he knows that all publications are closed on Dusshera and that there would be no newspaper the next day. The sage produces this edition, and goes off into the forest. When they open the newspaper, they find out that the company that they are working for, which got shut four months ago, is soon to start operations. And they also find out from the paper that a particular Raju, whose father is a BSNL employee, would go on to win a boxing championship, and give the prize money of Rs. 5 crores to these five IT professionals. Elated with this, they start searching for Raju and finally nab him in Vizag. On the other hand, Raju is a carefree guy who is jobless and spends his life without any aim. Rest of the story is as to how this group convince Raju to learn boxing and win the prestigious competition.
