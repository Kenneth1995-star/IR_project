Beauty and the Rogue

As described in a film magazine,[3] Roberta Lee (Minter), interested in uplift work, induces her father Thomas Lee (Periolat) to take on Bill Dorgan (Humphrey), a convict, as a gardener. Bill steals Roberta's jewelry the night she leaves on a vacation on a ranch, and he hides in the country not far from the ranch. Roberta meets Richard Van Stone (Forrest) and they become mutually attracted. Richard gives Roberta a brooch that he had bought from Bill. When Roberta recognizes it as being hers and believes Richard guilty of the theft, she turns him over to the sheriff. Bill is later captured and Richard is released. Roberta learns that Richard is her father's new general manager, and she goes to tell him that she and Richard are engaged.
