Aaru

Aarumugam aka Aaru (Suriya), is a thug and dealmaker with a band of boys handpicked from the slums of Chennai. Aaruâ€™s mentor Viswanathan (Ashish Vidyarthi) protects him, because Aaru gives him the violent undercover he needs. When Vishwanthan declares war on his bitter rival Reddy (Jaya Prakash Reddy), Aaru assists him. But Vishwanthan betrays him, resulting in the deaths of Aaru's subordinates. Aaru thus realizes Vishwanathan's true, evil nature and vows to destroy his power. There is also a subplot involving Aaru's romance with the college student Mahalakshmi (Trisha).
