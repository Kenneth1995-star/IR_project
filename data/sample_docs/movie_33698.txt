Naruto the Movie: Road to Ninja

The leaf ninjas drive off a group of fake Akatsuki members, impressing their families. After Naruto Uzumaki discovers Sakura Haruno arguing with her parents, Tobi uses Limited Tsukuyomi (限定月読, Gentei Tsukuyomi) to transport them into an alternate timeline. The two discover their friends acting oppositely compared with their usual personalities and Sasuke Uchiha being around at the village. While Sakura learns that she is orphaned with her father as the Fourth Hokage, Naruto reunites with his parents. When they obtain the Red Moon Scroll, the masked ninja abducts the repentant Sakura, forcing Naruto to choose between getting her or the scroll. After revealing his possessed counterpart as Menma (メンマ), Naruto purges Tobi from him to cancel the genjutsu and revert the timeline. Sakura apologizes to her parents and Naruto does to Iruka Umino for his mistake. This reminds Naruto that even though he is an orphan, he still has a family.
