Heart of Virginia

Racehorse owner Whit Galtry wants his horse Virginia's Pride to win so he can buy a new automobile for his daughter Virginia. He pressures jockey Jimmy Easter to do whatever it takes to finish first, but Jimmy inadvertently causes an accident that results in the death of another horse's rider.
A distraught Jimmy quits racing. Virginia's horse interests wealthy stable owner Dan Lockwood, who soon demonstrates an interest in her as well. Jimmy reluctantly trains and rides the horse, but when Virginia's Pride is injured, her father beats Jimmy with a whip. Dan seems to lose interest in Virginia when her horse is hurt, but ultimately both the horse and the romance are successful.
