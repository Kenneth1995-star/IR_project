Bahurani

The Zamindar (Nazir Hussain) has two sons — Raghu, by his first wife and Vikram, by his second wife. Raghu (Guru Dutt) is a simple-minded and innocent young man. Vikram (Feroz Khan) is cruel, domineering, selfish and greedy, and he maltreats everyone, from servants to his own brother Raghu. Vikram's vicious mother (Lalita Pawar) does the same.
After Vikram has a feud with a tough and smart village girl named Padma (Mala Sinha), who is the first person to ever confront him, the Zamindar gets the idea of marrying Vikram and Padma. Vikram refuses, and after a series of incidents, Padma ends up getting married to Raghu instead. When she understands how her husband has been treated over the years, she vows to set things right, and in the process falls in love with him. Inspired by her love, fearlessness and no-nonsense attitude, Raghu begins to find the courage to resist his oppressors.
