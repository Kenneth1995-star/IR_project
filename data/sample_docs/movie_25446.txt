Soni (Dharmendra) was an honest man who loved Mona (Hema Malini). Circumstances led him to join Mr. Chinoy (Kulbhubhushan Kharbanda), the Chief of Cosmos, an organization of smugglers that worked under the cover of Shipping Corporation. Years passed by and Soni became the chief of Cosmos and the M. D. of the Shipping Corporation, but all through he kept his wife, Mona in the dark about his business. But, when Soni decided to give up his ways, he was asked by the syndicate to complete the assignment on hand, a difficult task that only he could do. For the first time in his life, Soni was nabbed and the diamonds were found in his house. Soni found out that Ram (Jeetendra) was the only eyewitness. He tried to buy Ram and threatened him of dire consequences if he gave evidence against him. But Ram was not for sale. Both Soni and Mona were arrested. Soni came out on bail, but Mona refused to bail herself out. Infuriated with this, Soni vents his anger on Ram who he thought was the root cause of all his unhappiness. He got Ram's garment factory blasted, attempts were made on Ram's life till he was forced to leave the city with his family. Soni's men pursued them, made another gruesome attempt on Ram's life and killed his father. Ram swore on his father's dead body that he would not run anymore; he would prepare, return and hit back.
