Golden Ivory

Jim and Paul Dobson are a pair of brothers who are White Hunters in 1890 British East Africa. Paul seeks to make his fortune by finding the location of an elephants' graveyard a friend told him about before he died. The penniless pair decide to get near the location and get a wagon by hiring themselves out to protect and hunt game for a wagon train of settlers heading for Blood Mountain in the land of the Masai. Paul fools their party by taking them on a more dangerous route in order to locate the ivory of the graveyard. Enroute they pick up Mr Seth a prospector who is vague about the whereabouts of his fellow prospectors. The party faces danger from both the local fauna and natives.
