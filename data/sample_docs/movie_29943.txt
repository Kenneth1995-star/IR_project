Muthurasu (Karthik) and Periyasamy (Nizhalgal Ravi) are brothers, and live with their father (Vinu Chakravarthy) and their grandmother (Kanthimathi). Meenakshi (Sasikala), Muthurasu's cousin, will get marry with another man (Anandaraj) whereas she has to marry Muthurasu or Periyasamy. The brothers decide to kidnap Meenakshi. In the process, Periyasamy dies.
The two villages clash and arrange a panchayat to solve the problem. During the panchayat, Meenakshi says that she will stay in her uncle's house because Meenakshi hates the groom. Muthurasu's father decides to arrange the marriage between Muthurasu and Meenakshi but Muthurasu cannot forget Dhanam (Monisha). What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
