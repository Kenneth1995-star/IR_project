Calamity Jane and Sam Bass

Sheriff Will Egan doesn't want any gamblers in Denton, Texas and is suspicious when stranger Sam Bass arrives in town. The sheriff's sister Kathy likes the newcomer, though, while Calamity Jane is impressed with Sam's way with horses, even more so when Sam spots a poorly shod favorite in a horse race and bets against him, winning a tidy sum.
Sam buys the losing horse with his wager winnings and intends to race him. But when a hired guy poisons the horse, Sam shoots him. Sam tries to turn himself in, but feels he can't get a fair trial and busts out.
Sam becomes an outlaw, robbing banks. He believes Kathy has tricked him and turns to Jane.
He ends up shot, dying in Jane's arms, yet seemingly in love with Kathy.
