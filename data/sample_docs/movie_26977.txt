Dekh Tamasha Dekh

Inspired by a true incident, the film starts off when an underprivileged man gets crushed under the weight of a politician's (Satish Kaushik) poster. The film gets into the mood immediately after the man dies. The story gets into a climax as the judge tries to get into the details of the man's death, lawyers of parties argue the case and as it sparks communal riots. The deceased, who was a Hindu by birth, got converted to Islam. His death gives rise to a religious spark between the two religious factions who want his body to be burnt and buried, respectively.[3]
