Zoology

Natasha lives alone with her mother in a small seaside town. Her life is boring and conventional. In the zoo, where she works, Natasha has long been an object of ridicule. But suddenly a strange metamorphosis occurs with her - for no apparent reason she grows a tail. She has to go through shame, hope and despair to find herself.
