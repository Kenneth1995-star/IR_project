Deewana Mastana

Raja (Anil Kapoor) is a minor league crook who sells railway tickets on the black market at Amirpur Station. Tired of his job he looks for new ways to make a quick buck. One day, along with his friend Ghafoor (Johnny Lever) and a police inspector (Avtar Gill), he robs Rs 2.5 million from the railway treasury. Later, Raja and Ghafoor bump off the inspector and run away with the loot to Bombay.
At the Bombay airport, Raja sees psychiatrist Dr Neha (Juhi Chawla) and promptly falls in love with her. Raja and Ghafoor quickly find out where she lives. Ghafoor pretends to be a psychiatric patient while Raja takes on the name Raj Kumar and befriends her, telling her he has just returned from the U.S. However, Ghafoor cautions Raja not to hurry and be patient in matters of love.
The trouble begins when Bunnu (Govinda), the son of a wealthy businessman (Anupam Kher), is sent to Neha for treatment. He is crazy, and terrified of fire, heights, running, and water. Soon, he too falls for Neha and discovers he has a rival in Raja. Neha has to leave for Ooty with her father (Saeed Jaffrey) to attend her uncle's (Shakti Kapoor) wedding. She does not leave behind a forwarding address. Both Raja and Bunnu impersonate policemen and intimidate her secretary into revealing where she is. Neha is thrilled to see them in Ooty but is drawn closer to the ill Bunnu rather than Raja.
Things take an ugly turn when Ghafoor tries to kill Bunnu, who escapes. Bunnu contacts contract killer Pappu Pager (Satish Kaushik) to bump off Raja. However, that plan fails. Armed with a gold ring and garland, Neha calls Bunnu and Raja to court, ostensibly with the purpose of marriage. Both are surprised to see the other there.
Then they find out, Neha is getting married to someone else, Prem (Salman Khan) and Raja and Bunno end up being witnesses to her marriage. Raveena Tandon makes a special appearance in the end as both Raj and Bunnu walk off together.
