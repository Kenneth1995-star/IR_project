The Power of Silence

Arvind Chandrasekhar (Mammootty), a very successful lawyer with a track record any one would dream about, is appointed judge in the Karnataka High Court. Happily living in Bangalore with his wife Sangeetha (Pallavi Purohit) and their adorable children Arya and Aditya, the man has little to fret over. Before taking the oath, he visits his parents in Kerala. There he is harassed by threatening phone call from a veiled assailant who says he is not fit to be a judge. Arvind ignores the calls at first but things get serious when his wife and children face dangerous situations. The film narrates how he unveils the mystery with the help of his close friend Neil George (Anoop Menon), an IPS officer.
