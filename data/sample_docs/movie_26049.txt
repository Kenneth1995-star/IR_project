Jallad No. 1

Shankar (Dharmendra) is an executioner at a local police station. He could sense that an accused Joshi, who was sentenced to death, was an innocent person. Despite of his friend, Inspector Arjun's (Kiran Kumar) attempts to rescue Joshi, Shankar was forced to put him to death. Shankar, unable to bear the trauma, quit his job.
Shankar's family consisted of his wife, Kamla and sister, Geeta. There was a severe financial crunch at his place. Other employers wouldn't hire an ex-executioner as they were concerned about their own safety. He helped a group of criminals to find a treasure around his place, but the treasure turned out to be a trickery by an ex-gangman Takla Robert. Shankar put an end to Takla rescuing the criminals. The criminals were identified as Rapcha, Tillu, Katre and their leader, Shinde. Shinde was actively involved in the trade of arms and ammunition under the protection of Senior Inspector Dolkar (Deepak Shirke). Dolkar, in turn, was helped by a corrupt home minister.
In a desperate need for money to pay dowry, he approached Shinde (Shakti Kapoor) for a job. Shinde framed Shankar for his arms trade and was arrested by Inspector Arjun himself. The court sentenced him to prison. Since then, vengeance against the criminals was Shankar's prime objective.
Katre (Ishrat Ali) visited Shankar's house and gifted ₹10,000 to his wife and sister. However, they refused to take the money. Kamla 's health condition deteriorated and an urgent surgery had to be performed for which the fee was ₹10,000. Geeta approached Katre for the money. Katre, however, molested Geeta sexually and raped her. Geeta, unable to bear the trauma, consumed poison. Kamla was killed in the hospital bed by the corrupt home minister. Shankar vowed to kill everyone involved and also to assassinate the minister.
