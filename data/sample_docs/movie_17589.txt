Rikki and Pete

Rikky Menzies (Nina Landis) is an out-of-work geologist and aspiring singer (vocals by Wendy Matthews). Her brother Pete Menzies (Stephen Kearney) is a misfit inventor. To find peace of mind and escape the ire of Police Sergeant Whitstead (Bill Hunter), they travel the outback of Australia until they reach the desert mining town of Mount Isa and its own zany individualists.
