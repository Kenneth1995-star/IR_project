Shourya

Shourya (Manchu Manoj) and Netra (Regina Cassandra) are in love. But, Netra's father (Nagineedu) and uncle (Subbaraju) oppose this. So, both decide to elope. Before they leave for the UK, they arrive at Netra's village to spend a night in the village temple. On that night, someone tries to slit Netra's throat and Shourya gets implicated. The police also take the case seriously as Netra's father is an MP. Who tried to kill Netra? Why did he try to kill her? Why was Shourya implicated? How Shourya manages to track down the real culprits forms the story.
