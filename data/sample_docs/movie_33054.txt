Gorenger: The Red Death Match

When world peace is threatened by the emergence of a terrorist group called the Black Cross Army, a peacekeeping organization called EAGLE (for Earth Guard League)[citation needed] is formed by the United Nations to combat the threat. The Black Cross Army sends five operatives to destroy each EAGLE branch in Japan, killing everyone except for five agents. These surviving agents are summoned to a secret base located underneath the snack shop "Gon", where they are recruited by EAGLE Japan's commander, Gonpachi Edogawa. They become the Secret Squad Gorenger and are given electronic battlesuits that endow them with superhuman strength and speed. The five dedicate themselves to stopping the Black Cross Army and its leader, Black Cross FÃ¼hrer.
