The Family Strikes Back

Professor Kiu (Roy Chiao) is a mad scientist who developed mental disorders from grieving the death of his son, who succumbed to AIDS. Kiu orders his assistants to kidnap homosexual men to his lab, located in a private container on a vessel, for experiments. Police inspector Uncle Wah (Cho Tat-wah) had sent his subordinates to gather evidence in the vessel, but failed to find any.
Shek La-mai (Dean Shek), an acrobatic performer working in a nightclub, has practiced martial arts since childhood and was a former commander of the Special Duties Unit before he was dismissed by the police force due to accusations of sadism. Shek is currently a single father of three children living a happy life. One night during his performance, he and his protege, Lam Hong (Gary Lam), witnessed and intervened in a kidnapping incident by Kiu's henchmen, and the two became targets of Kiu. On the other hand, Uncle Wah discovers Shek's resemblance to a Japanese scientist named Toyota, who colluded with Kiu. Wah formulates a plan for Shek to act undercover as Toyota in order to gather evidence from Kiu's lab.
