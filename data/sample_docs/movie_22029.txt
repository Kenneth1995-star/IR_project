Between Strangers

Three women in Toronto confront emotional crises regarding the men in their lives. Olivia (Sophia Loren) looks after her husband John (Pete Postlethwaite), a wheelchair user. Olivia has aspired to a career as an artist but John refused to hear of her wasting her time. Olivia finds encouragement from an unlikely source, Max (GÃ©rard Depardieu), an eccentric French gardener.
Natalia (Mira Sorvino) is a news photographer who, on assignment in Angola, took a portrait of a crying child orphaned by war. Her father Alexander (Klaus Maria Brandauer), also a well-known photojournalist, is proud of Natalia when her photo appears on the cover of a news magazine but she is haunted by the fact that while she made the child famous, she couldn't save her life.
Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) has never been able to resolve her hatred of her father, Alan (Malcolm McDowell), who beat her mother to death when she was young. When Alan is released from prison, she's willing to abandon her husband, children and career as a musician to track him down and kill him, unable to accept that he's a changed man.[1]
