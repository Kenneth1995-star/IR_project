Lady of the Pavements

Disgusted that his fiancee, Diane (Jetta Goudal) has been cheating on him, Karl (William Boyd) says he'd rather marry a "street walker" than her. To get back at him, Diane arranges for Nanoni ("Little One") (Lupe VÃ©lez), a singer at a sleazy bar, to pretend to be a Spanish girl, from a convent, to fool him.[2]
