A Taste of Killing and Romance

Ice (Christine Ng), the leader of the killer organisation, sets a rule that whoever failed to achieve a task must die. Her underlings include her right-hand man Ko Sau (Andy Lau), nicknamed "Judge". During a mission, Ko Sau meets a fellow newcomer Yu-fung (Anita Yuen). During that time, he develops feelings for her. However, due to his lonely personality and the principles of an assassin career, it stalls the relationship. Despite this, they are still able to spend happy times together. During another mission, Ko Sau fails to complete the task when he saves a child. He apologizes to Ice and is willing to work unconditionally for her. However, Ice is determined to stick to the rules and sends Yu-fung to kill Ko, which Yu-feng is reluctant to do. On the other hand, hard boiled police inspector Tung Fai (Waise Lee) has gathered evidence of the organisation and holds a large scale hunt for Ko Sau and Ice's bodyguard Wong Cheung (Mark Cheng), who swears to kill Ko for revenge from a gunshot wound Ko had inflicted on him earlier. Under a lone and weak environment, with enemies all around him, Ko Sau and Yu-fung's relationship is also severely tested.
