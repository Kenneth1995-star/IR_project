The film begins with Mahendru (Balraj Sahni), a widowed police officer and his young daughter, Chanda. Chanda's best friend is Rekha (Suman Sikand), the daughter of a prostitute. Rekha stays over at Chanda's house, when Rekha's mother accidentally kills someone in an effort to stop her pimp (Jeevan) from carrying off Rekha into prostitution as well. She is sent to prison, and begs Mahendru not to reveal to Rekha anything about her life as a working girl. Mahendru promises to protect and raise the child as his own daughter. The pimp, Jeevan, attempts to kidnap Rekha, but his goons mistakenly kidnap Chanda. When he realizes the error, he decides to make the best of a bad situation by asking Mahendru for a large ransom. Mahendru borrows the ransom money from a friend, but the pimp deceives him and delivers the girl to a madam (Nadira).
Many years later, we find cab driver Somesh (Navin Nischol) driving Chanda (Priya Rajvansh) to her clients. Somesh is the ne'er-do-well scion of a rich family, who has a falling out with his father as he refuses to marry Rekha, the Police Officer's daughter. He leaves his wealthy home & life-style to become a cab-driver. Chanda and Somesh fall in love. Chanda eventually realizes that she really is Mahendru's daughter. This leads her to assume the daughter's duty by trying to convince Somesh to marry Rekha, her sister. She does this by turning alcoholic, in an effort to prove her essential wanton-ness to Somesh - who does not understand her intention and refuses to live his life according to her ideals of filial responsibility. Later, the pimp kidnaps Chanda again and informs Mahendru that his daughter is under his captivity and tries to blackmail him for the release of Chanda. However, Mahendru refuses to give in and attacks Jivan's camp with a police force. Chanda dies in this rescue operation. Before dying in her father Mahendru's arms, Chanda asks Somesh to marry Rekha, and he does.
