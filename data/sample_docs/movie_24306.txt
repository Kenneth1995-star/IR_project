Matwala Shair Ram Joshi

Ram Joshi is a Brahmin poet, who through his love of poetry and dance starts associating with the tamasha artists. He falls in love with the tamasha dancer Baya (Hansa Wadkar). The artists are of low-caste, and Joshi's interacting with them brings censure and he is out-lawed by the other members of his caste. The film follows his descent into alcoholism and his redemption from it through poetry.
