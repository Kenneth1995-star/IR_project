Sehra

Sherpal (Ulhas) and Tailab (Manmohan Krishan) are chiefs of two opposing clans who regularly meet at an annual competition that highlights their combative strengths in fields of weaponry. Sherpal's daughter Angara (Sandhya) is a tomboy who has been taught all that is required for the competition. She defeats Vikram (Prashant) who is from the clan of Taibal. The two fall in love, but cannot marry due to the old feud. Angara's mother (Lalita Pawar) is after her to behave like a girl and dress accordingly. She finally gives in to her mother's demands. When her father dies, Mangal (M. Rajan) appears claiming to be her betrothed, chosen by her father. When things start taking a violent turn, she agrees to marry him. Mangal then treats her badly after marriage. Angara suffers the humiliation and even carries a heavy weight across the desert, a punishment meted out to her by Mangal. As she trudges through the desert, she comes across a dying Vikram, who asks for water. She attempts to give him water against her husband's wishes, and is shot by Mangal. Angara and Vikram die together.
