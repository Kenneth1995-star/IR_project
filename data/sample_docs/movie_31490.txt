Chennai 2 Singapore

The film is a comedy about a struggling Indian film maker, Harish, who makes his way to Singapore to look for investors to finance his dream movie. However, a series of misfortunes foils his plans and he also ends up losing his passport. At a loss, Harish meets Vaanambaadi, an eccentric Singaporean cameraman. With Vaanambaadi's advice and help, Harish almost realises his dream. But then he meets a girl who is dying from cancer and gets swept up in a number of hilarious but serious situations. Without the cliched romance in Indian films, the story takes a light and humorous turn into a madcap journey about life, death and everything else.[4]
