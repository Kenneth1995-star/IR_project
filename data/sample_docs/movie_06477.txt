The Black Whip

John Murdock (Paul Richards) is a motorious outlaw who leads the vicious gang known as the Blacklegs. Armed with his signature black whip, he and his men invade a small town, looking to stir up trouble. In between harassing the girls at the saloon and attacking the locals, the Blacklegs are plotting a bigger scheme: kidnapping the governor of Kentucky (Patrick O'Moore) and holding him for ransom. The only man who stands in their way is former Confederate officer Lorn Crowford (Hugh Marlowe).
