Theekuchi

Sakthi (Jaivarma) is on a mission to take revenge on those who usurped government land and killed his mother (Bhanupriya) who wanted to construct a school there. Instead a local illicit arrack seller and rowdy Pasupathy Pandian (Ashish Vidhyarti) with the help of the Education Minister (Kadhal Dhandapani) builds a self-financing private engineering college and strikes gold.
Pasupathy becomes rich and powerful by giving admissions by getting capitation fees. The poor students who donâ€™t pay up either disappear or commit suicide. Sakthi and his friends including the heroine (Mythriya), daughter of Pasupathy fight back against this injustice and nefarious activities going on in the campus. How they ultimately triumph and justice prevails is what the film is about
