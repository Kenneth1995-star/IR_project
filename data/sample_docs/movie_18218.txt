There Goes The Bride

Running away from an arranged marriage, businessman's daughter Annette (Jessie Matthews) boards a train to Paris, only to have her bag stolen, and then herself suspected of theft by Max (Owen Nares), a wealthy young man sharing her carriage. Annette insists she was robbed, but cannot go into further detail because her picture is all over the newspapers, and she needs to escape. Max refuses to let her out of his sight until she can better explain, which she says she promises to do after 24 hours have passed. Farcical situations ensue, involving Max's fiance Cora (Carol Goodner), and all the while Max and Annette are falling in love.
