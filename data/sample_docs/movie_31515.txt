Raksha Rekha

Kalavathi, the only daughter of Simhala King Rajasimha, is averse to marriage. So was Sudhakara, son og King Parthapa of Avanthi. Unable to convince him to get married, King Parthapa keeps him, along with a servant Dooradarsi, in a dilapidated house in the forest. Angels, lead by Chitra, make a visit to the nearby Vishnu temple. Surprised at the glowing light from the otherwise haunted house, they enter it and find a handsome prince sleeping there. They lift him along with the cot and place him in Kalavathi's palace. In a trance, Kalavathi and Sudhakara exchange rings. The next day their marriage is performed. The same day Chitra turns the prince into a garland and takes him with her. Kalavathi, in the guise of man, goes in search of him. On way she meets princess Chandrika, who takes her to be a man, falls in love and marries her. Later, she comes to know of Kalavathi's story and vows to help her. Meanwhile, Chitra, frustrated with the adamant Sudhakara, who detests her, turns him into a statue and throws him before Kalavathi in Chandrika's place. A crestfallen Kalavathi throws away the Raksha Rekha that Markandeya Maharshi had given her for her protection. The Maharshi appears and brings Sudhakara back to human form. The couple live happily ever after.
