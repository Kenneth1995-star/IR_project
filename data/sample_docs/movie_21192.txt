Will

This film centres on the trials and tribulations in the lives of two main fictional characters eleven-year-old Will Brennan and Bosnian footballer Alek and their trek to see Liverpool play AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League Final at the Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul.
Brennan is Liverpool's number one fan, able to recite facts ad infinitum about the club and at a public school in the south of England since his father Gareth (Damian Lewis) is emotionally unable to care for him following the death of Will's mother. Gareth appears one day out of the blue with tickets for Liverpool's trip to the Champions League Final. Unknown to Will his father has health problems and suddenly dies and in his belief that the adults in his life are conspiring to quash his wish to get to the match to honour his father, two of his mates at school start Will on his way for reason of their own. His being missing becomes worldwide news and he encounters others that either support Liverpool or the game of football. One of these is Alek, in Paris, who stopped playing the sport following a tragic incident due to his own actions in his hometown during the Bosnian War.
Alek is initially reluctant to get involved for various reason but a friend does his best to encourage Alek to recover from his personal demons by helping Will reach his destination. The two are off on the final leg of the journey stopping along the way in Alek's hometown where they elude police. Although they reach Istanbul they do not have tickets but in the quest to get them Liverpool stars Kenny Dalglish, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, recognise him who come to the rescue and makes possible for Will to realise his dream and much more than he could have imagined if his father's original plans had come to be.[1][2]
