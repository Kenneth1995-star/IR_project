The Princess of Temple Street

Ever since little, Wilford (Michael Tse) has been suffering from mysophobia. Even his longtime girlfriend Flan (Belinda Hamnett) cannot stand him and dumped him. While he is feeling all sad, his friends bring him to Temple Street where steps in for the first time ever. There, he bumps into "The Princess of Temple Street" Sue (Tiffany Lee). As Wilford spends time with Sue, his mysophobia goes away and also develops a relationship with her. Things were going on pretty well until Flan returns.
