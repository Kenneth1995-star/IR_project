Prof. Ajay Saxena, (Jeetendra), is a common man with a strong streak of honesty, who arrives in the city of Mumbai, and joins as a Psychology professor in a college run by Mahendra Khanna, (Navin Nischol). One day, he berates a student Jaggi aka Jagdish, for his unruly behavior, not knowing that Jaggi was the nephew of Ramniklal and Mahesh Shah, who controlled the drug trade in the city, under the protection of a Don, Daya Patil (Mohan Joshi). Ajay stays as a paying guest with Mrs. D'Sa whose son Johnny is an ideal student for him. Jaggi takes his revenge by turning Johnny into a drug addict and getting him killed by a drug overdose. Then, the entire locality is witness to the slit-throat gory murder of Mrs. D'Sa on the crime-infested Mumbai streets, by gangster Daya Patil. Ajay cannot do anything and loses his hope in the due process of law, though his ex-student Inspector Rahul Singh (Rahul Roy), keeps assuring him to the contrary.
Satyajeet Anand is an editor of a newspaper, "The New Daily Times", portrayed by Suresh Oberoi, who is always hell-bent on exposing the criminals, dissuaded by his wife Pooja (Deepa Sahi), who fears their wrath. He helps Ajay in knowing who are the people who are corrupting the society, but is brutally murdered by them. His sister Kavita (Mamta Kulkarni), thereafter is publicly disrobed in the college library by drug peddler Jaggi. Ajay does not keep quiet now, and refuses to be a mere spectator to the heinous crime that the Illegal drug trade is. He wreaks havoc in bloody revenge by eliminating all the anti-social elements from the society. However, in the end, he is punished by the courts with life imprisonment, for taking the law into his own hands.
