Veeranna

Mariappan (Napoleon) is the faithful servant of Rajeshwari (Sheela), whereas Rajeshwari spreads terror among the villagers. Mariappan's son Veeranna (Napoleon), a military officer, is back to his village and he tires to be more quiet than before. His cousin Vennila loves him.
One day, children drunk the river's water and they fell ill because of a ladder factory which threw wastewater in the river. As a responsible citizen, Veeranna files complaint against the owner of the company Rajeshwari. In addition to this, Veeranna saves Rajeshwari's daughter Aishwarya (Preethi Varma), who was naked, from drowning. Rajeshwari orders him to leave the village on the spot but he refuses and he gets married with Aishwarya. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
