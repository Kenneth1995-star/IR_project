Raam

The story revolves around the relationship of a mother and her son, set in Kodaikanal. The movie commences with Ramakrishnan (Jiiva) and his mother Saradha (Saranya Ponvannan), a school teacher, lying in a pool of blood; The police find Raam is still alive and arrest him on charges of murdering his mother. Police inspector Umar (Rahman) works on the case. The story is narrated in flashback.
Rama Krishna is an apparently mentally affected teenager (later diagnosed as autistic), living dependent on his mother Saradha. His overcompulsive adoration for his mother lands her in various problems. Raam is provoked easily and tolerates little wrongdoing around him. Next door lives Karthikayeni (Gajala), daughter of a Police Sub-Inspector Malaichamy (Murali). She falls for Raam, but upon telling him how she feels, gets a blunt response from him.
One day, Saradha is found brutally murdered. Umar, interrogating various personalities for the case, grills each and every person possibly connected to Raam and the teacher. Every possible motive that Raam might have for murdering his mother is explored. Furthermore, Raam's neighbors, the sub-inspector Malaichamy and his children are summoned by Umar for interrogation, much to their irritation. The police eventually find out that it was Karthika's brother (Kunal Shah), who committed the murder, in fear that Saradha would tell his parents about his drug addiction habits.
When Umar confronts him and forces him to surrender, Karthika's brother fatally wounds him and escapes, injuring his father in the process as well. On finding the hideout of her brother from his friends, Karthika tries to plead with him to surrender. But he refuses to do so and ties up Karthika. Raam, seeking vengeance, finds the hideout. A brutal fight occurs between the two, and at the end, Raam kills Karthika's brother. The film ends as the police find the hideout, while Raam is meditating on a dilapidated roof.
