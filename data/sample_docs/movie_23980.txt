Batakrishna Dalvi,a retired and idealist school master, is respected as a father figure in his village. One day he falls sick and is admitted to the city hospital. His son Ghanshyam presumes his father to be dead when he does not find his father in the hospital bed. Haren Naik, the village chief, Mondal, the money lender, Nibaran, the fish monger, the trio who have always exploited the poor villagers take full advantage of Batakrishna's sudden death. In Batakrishnan's absence the trio succeeds in spreading the veil of superstation and drives away a poor village girl Sumi out of the village citing her to be a witch. Her fault was that she had an affair with Nabin's son Madan. The poor villagers failed to raise their voice and succumb to the plot of these three men. But Batakrishna comes back after three months. The poor supersticious villagers who were so convinced of Batakrishna being dead, start considering him to be a ghost. Batakrishna starts appearing as a ghost, Hiren, Mandal and Nibaran, who have been falsely scaring the villagers with superstitions, fall into their own trap. To get rid of the ghost of Batakrishna, the trio call upon a witch doctor; but unfortunatetly for them in the middle such a performance Batakrishna gets them arrested with help of the BDO on the ground of spreading superstition.
