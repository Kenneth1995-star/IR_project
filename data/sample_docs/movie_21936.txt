Black List (Liste noire)

Following the trial of a judge who was found with prostitute Gabrielle Angers (Geneviève Brouillette), Gabrielle gives a list of her clients to a new judge, Jacques Savard (Michel Côté), which contains the names of some very influential judges and politicians. Dead bodies and death threats follow. Jacques' own life seems to be in danger.
