Angel

After Interpol destroys a mass of Thai opium fields, the drug lords strike back by viciously murdering the officers in charge of the drug raid. In response, the cops hire the mercenary Angel Organization whose leader, John (David Chiang), sends crack agentsâ€”Angel #01 Saijo (Hideki Saijo), Moon (Moon Lee) and Elaine (Elaine Lui). Their first act is to seize a massive drug shipment with the help of an American secret operative, Commander Alex Fong (Alex Fong). This inevitably invokes the rage of frighteningly fierce Madam Yeung (Yukari Oshima) who recently grabbed the mantel of power after killing her predecessor. After a series of tussles with Madam Yeung, Saijo finds himself buried alive in an armored car while Moon and Elaine settle their score with their nemesis kung fu style.
