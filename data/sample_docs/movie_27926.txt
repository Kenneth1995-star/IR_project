Chinthamani Kolacase

The basic premise is of a lawyer doling out his brand of justice on criminals whom he himself had freed from the courts.
The story is centered on Lal Krishna Viradiar (Suresh Gopi), the enigmatic criminal lawyer with an even more enigmatic mission. Lal Krishna helps out hardened criminals to get away from the courts by lying that there is no proof for their crime. But later, he pursues and takes them out in a bizarre show of vigilante justice.
The film begins with the acquittal of Isra Khureshi (Baburaj), accused of raping and killing Rasiya, his Arabic teacher. Isra Khureshi calls up Lal Krishna Viradiyar, his lawyer, asking him to come to meet him at an isolated place for a celebration. Lal Krishna arrives at the spot and kills Khureshi, claiming that it is his duty to wipe out evil forces to maintain the cosmic law. He then kills David Rajarathnam (Bheeman Raghu), a Tamil businessman, who was accused of raping his own daughter. Jagannivasan (Biju Menon), the Additional Superintendent of Police, is suspicious of the Lal Krisnan's moves, and has been following him for a long time. It was then that the case of Mirchi Girls, a band of spoilt, rich NRI girls, reaches him.
They are the main accused in the murder of Chinthamani (Bhavana), their college mate, an innocent girl from a conservative background. Viramani Varier (Thilakan), her father is fighting hard for justice and is represented by Kannayi Parameshwaran (Saikumar), a public prosecutor, who is famous for his unique style of argument. After a long court battle, Lal Krishna succeeds in bringing the judgement in favor of Mirchi Girls. LK finds out that it was none other than Kannayi Parameshwaran and the college principal Dr. Kim Sudarshan who committed the murder of Chinthamani while attempting to rape her. Lal Krishna, in his own violent way kills Kannayi and Sudarshan to deliver justice to Chinthamani and her old father Viramani Varier.
