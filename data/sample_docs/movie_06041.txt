In late October 1943, a battalion of US Marines have landed on Choiseul Island to create a diversion for the impending Allied invasion of Japanese held Bougainville Island.
Four of them (Frank Lovejoy, Tony Curtis, Skip Homeier and Alan Wells) have been selected to carry out a reconnaissance patrol to find a French planter (Eduard Franz) and his daughter (Mary Murphy). The planter has sent a solitary radio message to the Allies concerning the area the Japanese have mined; if the information is true it could save a projected 18% of the Marine invasion force. The patrol must confirm that the message is authentic, and that the planter is still alive, as he can give the Marines valuable information needed for a successful amphibious landing by the Allied forces. Once obtaining the information the small party is to make a rendezvous on the coast with a US Navy PT boat. The members of a patrol are the sole survivors of their Sergeant's platoon on Guadalcanal with both the patrol members and the Sergeant blaming their demise on their Sergeant's leadership.
