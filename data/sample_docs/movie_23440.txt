Troublesome Night 3

The film consists of three loosely connected segments based on the central theme of a mortuary. Shishedo, a mortician, is grief-stricken when his favourite singer, Lam Wing-si, is killed in a car accident. Lam's face was badly marred so Shishedo takes her place in the coffin by disguising himself as the deceased singer. He disappears and leaves his colleagues to deal with the ghostly aftermath. In the next segment, Gigi wants a memorial service for her mother, who had hanged herself. The ghost of Gigi's mother is displeased when the greedy morticians try to trick her daughter into using their services so she haunts them. The last segment involves Hung, a mortician, who commits suicide after her boyfriend dumps her because of her job. Her boyfriend faces retribution when her ghost returns to haunt him and he dies in an accident later.
