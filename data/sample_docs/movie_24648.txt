Ladki Sahyadri Ki

Rani (Sandhya) and her family are poor, but she is not allowed to work when offered a job in a theatrical company, as it is against the custom of her family to have girls working. However, she takes on the job when the village temple needs money for repairs. The stage-owner starts drinking and makes inappropriate advances to Rani. When she snubs him, he stops the work on the temple restoration. Rani is separated from her family, but finally reunites with them and has the temple completed.
