Fort Yuma

When word reaches a U.S. Cavalry command that an Apache chief's son is planning an attack on Fort Yuma, a column of soldiers led by Lt. Ben Keegan is sent to deliver ammunition and supplies. Keegan has a longstanding hatred of the Indians and even resents that his chief scout, Sgt. Jonas, is an Apache himself.
Accompanying them is missionary Melanie Crown, an educated and enlightened woman from the East who despises prejudice and strongly believes everyone can live together in harmony, and the sergeant's sister, Francesca, whose mutual attraction with Keegan is complicated, considering his views.
The company is attacked, its soldiers being picked off one by one until only the two officers and two women remain alive. Apaches steal the dead soldiers' uniforms and intend to approach the fort in disguise. Fighting off two Apache attackers, Keegan kills one and hangs the other, against the appeals of the others.
Francesca is killed, dying in Keegan's arms, which brings about a change in his attitudes. He and the others reach the fort just as the disguised Apaches' real identities are discovered. A fierce battle, saber vs. knife, ensues between Keegan and the Apache chief's son, man to man. Keegan survives and experiences remorse for his beliefs, while Melanie and Jonas intend to set an example for the others how to co-exist in peace.
