Palnati Yudham

King Anugu of Palnadu has three sons - Nalagama Raju, Narasinga Raju, and Malideva Raju - from his three wives. Before his death, he anoints Nalagama Raju the king and leaves him to the care of his minister Brahmanaidu. During Anugu's rule, a wealthy and powerful woman Nagamma enters the kingdom. Brahmana is a Vaishnavite, while Nagamma is a staunch Saivite. Progressive-minded Brahmanna allows Harijan entry into temples and appoints a Harijan, Kannama Dasu as the army commander. This irks the upper caste people and also the prince Narasinga Raju, who seeks the help of Nagamma.
In the king's court, Nagamma accuses Brahmana of fomenting trouble. This leads to Malideva demanding a division of the kingdom. Much against the wish of Nagamma, Nalagama divides the kingdom, and Macherla is given to Malideva, who rules it with Brahmanaidu as his adviser. Nagamma holds control over Gurajala and its ruler Nalagama. She hatches a conspiracy to unite the country and make Narasinga Raju as the king. As part of it, Malideva is invited for Kodi Pandelu (cockfight), the traditional competition held during Sankranthi. The loser has to leave the kingdom and live incognito for seven years. Nagamma cheats to win, but after the seven-year exile refuses to hand over the kingdom to Malideva. Not only that, she arranges to kill the emissary Alaraju, son-in-law of Nalagama. This results in war and the annihilation of almost the entire clan. In the war field, Nagamma realizes her mistake and seeks pardon from Brahmana.
