Antham

Raghav (Nagarjuna) is an orphan and he gets the timely help from a don (Danny Denzongpa) who hires him for contract killing after growing up. Raghav has a very calm life and there is no room for relationships for him. Just at that juncture he meets Bhavana (Urmila Matondkar) an ornithologist student and falls in love with her innocence and charm. He hides his real identity from her and she starts loving him too. When things look hopeful for Raghav, Bhavana comes to know the real identity of him and starts moving away from him. Rest of the film is about what happens to the ill-fated contract killer- Raghav.
