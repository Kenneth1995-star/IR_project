Asha Jaoar Majhe

The woman (Basabdatta Chatterjee) works in a handbag factory while the man (Ritwick Chakraborty) works the night shift at a printing press. The film follows that young married couple as they go about their day, how they stay apart all day long except one brief moment when they get to be with each other. The entire movie has no dialogues. It has background music and some classic old songs thrown in for a soothing effect.
