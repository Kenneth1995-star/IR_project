Gunmen

During the Chinese Civil War, a group of war friends Ting Kwan-pik, Cheung, Lau Fuk-kwong and Cheung Cho-fan were captured and brutally tortured by officer Haye. After they escape, Ting headed to Shanghai and became a cop. Ting is also one of the few righteous, incorruptible cops in Shanghai. Although the police force consists mostly of corrupt cops, the superintendent is an honest man. One time during a drug raid, Ting kills Haye's uncle, Leung. Haye, who has know became an opium smuggler, vows of revenge and later kills Ting's partner. Ting also swears revenge, and with nobody else helping, he tracks down his war friends and enlists their help to outlaw opium smuggling.
