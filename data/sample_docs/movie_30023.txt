Kattabomman

The village chairman Kalingarayan (Sakthivel) and his son Rajappa (Uday Prakash) spread terror among the villagers. Whereas Kattabomman (Sarath Kumar) is an angry man who cannot tolerate injustice. He was brought up by his grandfather (Nagesh) and his widowed mother. His family and Kalingarayan's family are in feud since several years. Kattabomman falls in love with Kalingarayan's daughter Priya (Vineetha) and he gets married with her without their family's wishes. In angry, his grandfather tells their past. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
