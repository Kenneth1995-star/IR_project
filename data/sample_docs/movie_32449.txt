Parama Veera Chakra

Chakradhar (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is a famous movie actor though his mother (Jayasudha) doesn’t approve of his celebrity status. Instead, she yearns to see her son as a Major in the Army, true to the promise she has given to Bobbili Puli (N. T. Rama Rao). As Chakradhar dons various roles, an army Colonel Jeetendra (Murali Mohan) tells him that he has a story in which he wants Chakradhar to act. The Colonel narrates him a story of an army major – Major Jaya Simha (again Balakrishna). However, there is a catch. Major Jaya Simha is not a fictional character, but a real time army man who looks ditto like Chakradhar, and valiantly arrested a dreaded terrorist – Abdul Ghani. The tragedy is Jaya Simha is now in a vegetative state (on mechanical ventilation), thanks to a conspiracy plotted by politicians, few army men and terrorists themselves. Colonel Jeetendra asks Chakradhar to act like Major to ensure that the nation's security plans are not compromised. How Chakradhar attacks the terrorists and how he brings back the honor of the Major forms the rest of the story.[7]
