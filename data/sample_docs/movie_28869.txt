Mukhtiar Chadha

Mukhtiar Chadha (Diljit Dosanjh) is a Delhi-based jack of trades, without a stable source of income. He lives with his widowed mother (Kiran Juneja), and does a variety of professions including being a property dealer, and sometimes being a con-artist. He is also an avid investor in stocks. Mukhtiar also falls in love with his neighbor (Oshin Brar), though the girl’s father does not approve of him.
Trouble arises for Mukhtiar, when he brokers a land deal, but the buyers (Yashpal Sharma and Khayali Ram) illegally grab his client’s land by only making a part payment to his client. Mukhtiar fights those goons and manages to defeat them.
