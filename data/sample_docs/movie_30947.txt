Aarumaname

The film begins with Vaithi (Deepak) running to save his elder brother Moorthy (Sriman) from goons. Upon his arrival, Moorthy is seriously wounded and covered with blood.
Vaithi lived with his father Arunachalam (Rajesh), a retired teacher, his mother and his brother Moorthy. Moorthy was a successful CPWD engineer and the pride of Arunachalam while Vaithi was a kind-hearted auto-driver and was hated by Arunachalam. Moorthy, being an incorruptible engineer, attracted the anger of Ratnavel (Sudheer Sukumaran) and Rajadurai (Ponvannan) who were constantly trying to bribe him to get his approval for a project. In the meantime, Vaithi and Anandhi (Nicole), sister of Ratnavel and Rajadurai, fell in love with each other. The circumstances forced Moorthy to get married with Thenmozhi (Mythili) but he didn't like her.
Back to the present, Moorthy dies in the arms of Vaithi but before dying he pronounces the name Kadambari. Vaithi suspects Ratnavel and Rajadurai for killing his brother. Few days later, a woman (Karthika Mathew) with a baby introduces to Vaithi as Kadambari and reveals that she was Moorthy's secret wife. By pity, Vaithi accommodates them in Moorthy's outhouse. The whole village talks ill about Kadambari and Vaithi's relationship, but Vaithi keeps the secret and takes the insults of the village. Vaithi is now disowned by his father Arunachalam and his girlfriend has broken up with him. One day, Periyasamy (Ganja Karuppu) who witnessed his brother's murder reveals that the killer was Kadambari's brother Boopathy (Anand), a criminal. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
