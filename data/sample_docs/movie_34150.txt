Alexander

The film starts with Nevsky's wedding which involves an attempt of poisoning by his former friend Ratmir. Yashka, a jester at the wedding tried to warn him but was dragged away and was put under a table by the Nevsky's guards. Desperate to serve his leader as a savior, not only as a fool, Yashka comes out of the table and drinks from Nevsky's cup in which suspected poison was placed. After the attempt, Ratmir escapes the ceremony and gallops away on a horse. After the ceremony, Alexander orders to find him, because he suspects that Ratmir was plotting it from the orders of the Swedes who were approaching Novgorod at that time. Meantime, the Boyars and Mongols are besieging the city as well. Alexander then goes underground where he finds Boyars and kill their leader.
