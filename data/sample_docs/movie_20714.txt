Faeries

While waiting for their new home to be renovated, Nellie and her younger brother George are sent to a farm in the countryside, much to George's delight and Nellie's disgust. However, the farmhouse and the surrounding area are teeming with fey creatures. The first the two children encounter is a somewhat unfriendly hobgoblin named Broom who is (more or less) secretly looking after the farm.
While playing outside, George inadvertently stumbles into a fairy ring surrounding a tree and ends up in the realm of faeries. Nellie, alerted by Broom, goes after him but arrives just in time to find George eating from a faery cake. The law of the realm states that a mortal who consumes faery food must remain in the realm forever. Nellie and George strongly — and vociferously — protest. So the Faery Prince, the ruler of the realm, offers them a chance to escape by setting three tasks for them.
What they do not know is that the evil brother of the Prince, the Shapeshifter, tries to manipulate the children and the fairy citizens to usurp the rulership of the faery realm. In addition, the Prince falls in love with the human farmhand Brigid, which proves pivotal in an old prophecy that foretells the future for the faery realm.
