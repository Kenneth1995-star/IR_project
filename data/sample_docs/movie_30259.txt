Vasanth Periyasamy changes his identity into Krishnamoorthy, a car driver and lives in disguise for his family sake. In the past he is married to Meena (herself),an illiterate woman,and has a daughter Priya (Baby Jennifer). Some terrorists kidnap Meena and they threaten to kill her if he doesn't release their partners in jail.

The Department of the Navy sends Vasanth to jail, and so he decides to forget the navy and becomes a simple car driver in disguise.
Compelled by the navy, Vasanth Periyasamy finally accepts to solve this odd affair and investigates the sea murders.
