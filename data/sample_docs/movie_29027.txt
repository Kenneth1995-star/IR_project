A young man in a Zamin village loves a girl. The evil son of the Zamindar also wants that girl. The zamindar's son uses his might and evicts the young man out of the zamin village. The young man returns to the village, over-powers the zamin and gets all the zamin lands to be distributed among the villagers.[4]
