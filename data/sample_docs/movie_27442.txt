Katari Veera Surasundarangi (3D)

The film is a sequel to Upendra's earlier movie Rakta Kanneeru which was released in 2003.
Upendra (Upendra), is a wannabe don who dies in a gang war. When he reaches the doors of Heaven and Hell, he decides to go to hell as he feels heaven's beautiful look and silence makes it too boring. He soon meets Yama (Ambarish) who is unable to decide whether to put him in hell or heaven as he has not done any sin nor any good deed. In the midst of this, Upendra finds his father, Mohan (also Upendra) and also falls in love with Indraja (Ramya), the daughter of Indra. After her initial rejection, He manages to get her to reciprocate as well. But Indra, refusing to let his daughter marry a human, challenges Upendra that he has to go to earth for 10 days with Indraja and will forget that he ever died once he reaches there. In these 10 days, if Upendra does a sin, then he will have to forget Indraja. Upendra and Indraja accept the challenge and go to earth with Yama and Chitragupta (Doddanna). Once on earth, Upendra and Indraja get together with Upendra forgetting everything that happened when he died. But he overhears Indraja talking to Indra secretly and remembers everything. Yama in the meantime is desperate to make sure Upendra loses the challenge. He even changes Upendra's face with that of the don's (Ajay) who had killed Upendra in the first place. The film ends with Yama understanding the power of love and leaving from there and Upendra and Indraja getting married.
