Ek Mahal Ho Sapno Ka

Vishal (Dharmendra) and Aruna (Sharmila Tagore) are in love. Aruna learns that she is going to become blind. She doesn't want to be a burden on Vishal, who is already taking care of his handicapped mother. So Aruna marries her much older employer (Ashok Kumar).
The plot further thickens when the young daughter of Ashok Kumar falls in love with Vishal. The question "Will Vishal, who does not know the reason for Aruna's defection, use this to take revenge on Aruna?" forms the rest of the story.
