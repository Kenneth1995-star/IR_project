Athey Manithan

Mandhira Moorthy (Livingston), a medical representative, will soon marry Bhavani (Maheswari), a rich girl.
Mandhira Moorthy was in love with Bhagavathi (Lakshmi), a poor dancer, and she became pregnant. His aunt pressured him for money. Mandhira Moorthy had a lot of debts and decided to leave the village.
Bhagavathi comes to his house to see him after a while. Shocked to see her before his marriage, Mandhira Moorthy marries her in front of God and kills the harmless Bhagavathi. Mandhira Moorthy feels very guilty.
After his wedding with Bhavani, he suspects Bhavani being haunted by Bhagavathi.
