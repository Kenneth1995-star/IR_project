Avan Pithana?

Nallaiah, a wealthy industrialist, disowns his son after learning of the latter's desire to marry an impoverished woman. The son and wife die separately, leaving their son Kumar to fend for himself. A kind couple, who run a tea shop, adopt Kumar and raise him as their own. One day, a woman named Gomathi runs into the tea shop after being chased by a man. Kumar offers her shelter, and some time later, takes her to Nallaiah to work as his nurse. Kumar is not aware that Nallaiah is his grandfather. Nallaiah is unwell and regrets his decision to disown his son. Gomathi wins Nallaiah's trust and is given the keys to his safe. When Nallaiah dies, this leads to a quarrel for the property he leaves behind. A group of miscreants forge Nallaiah's will to add their own names to it. But Kumar arrives and stakes his claim to the inheritance after proving that he is Nallaiah's grandson.
