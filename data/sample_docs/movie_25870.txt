Sardari Begum

The police are called to investigate the death of a woman during a riot in the walled city of Delhi.[2] She was killed by a stone thrown by an agitated mob. The woman killed is known in the community as "Sardari Begum" (Kiron Kher), a popular singer and courtesan. The religious nature of the incident and the impending elections combine to attract the media's attention. When a young reporter covering the funeral, Tehzeeb Abbasi (Rajina Raj Bisaria), discovers her father among the mourners, her curiosity prompts her to investigate further. Then comes the revelation that the singer was in fact her aunt, who was disowned by her family for rebelliously learning music from a concubine.
