Up for Murder

Bob Marshall gets a promotion at a newspaper thanks to his reporter pal Collins, who owed him a favor. Marshall is assigned to be society columnist Myra Deane's escort to a ball. He falls for Myra and buys her a bracelet from his meager savings.
Arriving uninvited at her luxurious apartment, Bob is shocked to discover Myra is romantically involved with William Winter, a married man who is also their boss. Bob slugs him during a quarrel. Winter's skull hits a table and he dies, but Myra lies, insisting Winter is merely unconscious, hoping to avoid a scandal. She moves the body once Bob leaves.
Bob reads about Winter's death in the paper and turns himself in to the law as the culprit. He is convicted of murder and sentenced to be executed before Myra comes forward with the truth. Bob later receives a package with the bracelet inside, along with Myra's invitation to return it to her in person.
