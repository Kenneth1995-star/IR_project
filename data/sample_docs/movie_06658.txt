Star in the Dust

Gunlock's town sheriff (Agar) is planning to hang Sam Hall (Boone) for shooting three farmers found on cattle land at sundown. At the casino, betting odds are 8 to 3 he won't make it. The cattlemen are set to rescue Sam; the farmers hope to lynch him before he can be rescued. Hall schemes for escape with his girl Nellie (Coleen Gray). Sheriff Jorden is most concerned with finding out who hired Hall; a leading suspect is the sheriff's future brother-in-law.[2]
