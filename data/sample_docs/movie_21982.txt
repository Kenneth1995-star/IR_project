Full Blast

A strike at a sawmill in a small fictional community in New Brunswick puts Steph (David La Haye) and Piston (Martin Desgagn√©) out of work. They want to resurrect their band Lost Tribe but Marie-Lou (Marie-Jo Therio), Piston's ex-wife and the band's former lead singer, is not enthusiastic about the idea.
Meanwhile, Steph is having relationship trouble with Rose (Louise Portal), an older woman that he's been seeing and drifts first to Marie-Lou and then to Charles (Patrice Godin), who once left town but is now back.
