Duplicate

Bablu Chaudhary (Shah Rukh Khan), a bubbly young man, is an aspiring chef. He gets a job as the lead chef at a hotel and meets the charming Sonia Kapoor (Juhi Chawla), the hotel manager. They bond and Bablu falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Manu, (Shah Rukh Khan in a double role), Bablu's lookalike, is a ruthless criminal who has escaped from jail to kill his partners, who have betrayed him. One day, when Bablu takes Sonia out for lunch, he gets arrested because the police think that Bablu is Manu. Bablu is able to prove his true identity, but not before Manu hears of his duplicate and decides to take his place by killing him. There is a lot of confusion about who is who by all associated with the two men, including Sonia, Bablu's mother Bebe (Farida Jalal), and Manu's girlfriend, Lily (Sonali Bendre). How these confusions resolve forms the rest of the story.
