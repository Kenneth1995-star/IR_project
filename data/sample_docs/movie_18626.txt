Talk About Jacqueline

A drama about two sisters, Jacqueline and June, who are very close and stand by each other, even though their stories separates them. The older sister, Jacqueline (Carla Lehmann), has a sexually liberal backstory, and the younger is quite unspolied by life. The story picks up when Jacqueline travels to the French Riviera to change scenery, look for new adventures and search for an eligible bachelor who has no prior knowledge about her frivolous past. Soon she finds a suitable man, Doctor Michael Thomas (Hugh Williams), and they get married. Eventually Jacqueline is haunted by her past, as her picture turns up in a tabloid newspaper, and her husband catches a glimpse of his new bride's flamboyant previous mistakes. Jacqueline's younger sister, June (Joyce Howard), decides to help her older sister out to save her marriage from falling apart. She takes the blame and tells Michael that she is the one who has fooled around in the recent past. However, this information gives her problems of her own, as it finds its way to her own romantic interests, and threatens to destroy her own love life. The story ends with the older sister ultimately confessing her past to her husband and the other parties to the conflict, saving her sister with the truth.
