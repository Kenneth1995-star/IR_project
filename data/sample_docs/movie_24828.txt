Anuraag

A blind sculptor, Shivani (Moushumi Chatterjee) stays in an ashram and makes friends with a small boy (Satyajit), who is suffering from cancer. She falls in love with Rajesh (Vinod Mehra). Rajesh asks his parents to permit him to marry her, to which his mother agrees, but his father refuses under her present condition. Then, an eye specialist reveals that an eye replacement would cure her.
Later, as a dying wish, the young boy donates his eyes to her, thus granting her eyesight for the first time in her life.[3]
