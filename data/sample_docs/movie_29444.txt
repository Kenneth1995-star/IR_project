Vilaiyaattu Pillai

Muthiah (Ganesan) manages to tame Neelamani, a bull owned by Maragatham (Padmini), the daughter of a wealthy man (V. S. Raghavan). After Muthiah's victory, Maragatham challenges him to participate in a Rekla race. Muthiah participates and emerges victorious, and Maragatham falls in love with him. Muthiah's mother (Lakshmi), while happy about the accolades her son has won, believes he is too playful and advises him to marry and live more responsibly. Muthiah's relative (Balaiah) agrees to talk to Maragathamâ€™s father and fix the marriage between Muthiah and Maragatham, but has plans of his own. Instead of Muthiah, he finalises Maragatham's marriage with his spoilt son (Cho Ramaswamy). On the day Maragatham is supposed to marry Ramaswamy, she and Muthiah elope and marry, and eventually have a son (Prabhakar). One day an elephant goes out of control, but Muthiah manages to overpower it, saving the princess (Kanchana) in the process. She develops a liking for Muthiah and invites him and his family to the palace. The butler of the royal family is jealous of Muthiah. Seeking to tarnish Muthiah's image, he spreads rumours about Muthiah and the princess. Eventually, Muthiah is forced to overpower a bull whose horns are painted with poison. Despite that, he succeeds and continues to live prosperously with his family.[1]
