Defence of the Realm

Following a crash of a nuclear bomber at an American Air Force base in the British countryside, Dennis Markham (Ian Bannen), a prominent Member of Parliament and opponent of the American nuclear presence in the United Kingdom, is reported by a London paper to have been seen leaving a woman's home. When the woman is found to also be familiar with a dignitary from East Germany, Markham's loyalty to his country is questioned. He is hounded by the media and is forced to resign.
The author of the newspaper expos√©, Nick Mullen (Gabriel Byrne), continues his work with colleague Vernon Bayliss (Denholm Elliott) who suspects that Markham is being framed for his views. When Bayliss dies from a mysterious 'heart attack', Mullen suspects something deeper at work and finds evidence of a cover-up concerning a near-accident at a nuclear site and a secret US Air Force base. With the help of Markham's secretary, Nina Beckman (Greta Scacchi), Mullen continues to investigate the affair despite the attempts of the British Government to stop him. In the end, Mullen and Beckman are seemingly killed in an explosion, but Mullen's story about the cover-up is published.
