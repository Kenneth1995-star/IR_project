Stormy Crossing

Two swimmers attempt to swim across the English Channel, but, under cover of fog, one of them is deliberately drowned by her lover (Bond) after she demands he leave his rich wife for her or she will tell his wife about their affair. Officially, her death is ruled an accident, but her fellow swimmer is convinced that it was not. His swimming coach (Ireland) is initially doubtful, but when he realizes he has been deliberately lied to, he investigates and brings the villain to justice.
