Santosh (Diganth) is an educated software professional who comes from a well to do family. He is the only child to his parents. He has two close friends, who are also his office colleagues. Santosh has a pet dog which he loves dearly. Santosh' mother (Sudha Balewadi) loves her son and is very eager to get him married. She keeps pestering Santosh with marriage proposals, which makes Santosh feel uncomfortable. After, many unsuccessful attempts to find a suitable match, Santosh and his friends come across an online matrimony site. Santosh' friends though married, try their luck on the site, but end up having an unpleasant experience. They ask Santosh to upload his profile to find a suitable match. Santosh uploads his profile and makes a search, which leads him to Kushi (Bhama) a Punjabi girl with ancestry in Karnataka.
Santosh is initially taken aback by her ability to speak Kannada so well. After, few exchanges on phone and chat, they eventually fall in love. Santosh's friends encourage him to take this matter ahead and advise him to visit Chandigarh, the place where Kushi stays. Santosh leaves for Chandigarh much to the anguish of his mother. On reaching the city, he meets Kushi and Kushi's family accepts him after slight difficulty. Santosh and Kushi enjoy each other's company but, Santosh is uncomfortable because of the behaviour of some of Kushi's family members. Both, Santosh and Kushi dream of getting married.
But, destiny has something else in store. Santosh is killed in a shooting from the enemy side that leaves his family and friends shell shocked and aghast. Kushi's father does not let Kushi know about it as he understands that she will not be able to go through it.
