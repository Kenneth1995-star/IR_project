The story revolves around P.K. Jayan aka 'Vattu' ('mad') Jayan (Indrajith), Roy Joseph aka Che Guevera Roy (Murali Gopy) and Kaitheri Sahadevan (Hareesh Peradi). Jayan is a corrupt policeman, Roy a communist who now teaches in a school with his wife and Sahadevan a megalo-maniacal communist leader. When Roy and two of his friends expose Sahadevan's corruption, the two friends are mysteriously murdered; Roy is spared, probably because of his high-ranking friends and his old 'friendship' with Sahadevan. After Roy dies of a medical condition, Jayan discovers the story of this old friendship. Sahadevan and Roy had once worked together, before Roy's idealism and Sahadevan's use of violence and trickery soured their relationship. In one scene, Sahadevan tells Roy about his painful childhood, claiming that his actions are aimed at ensuring that his children do not suffer as his ancestors did. Jayan finally discovers that Sahadevan had once hired goons to attack Roy, maiming him for life and leading to his death. In his anger, he attacks and stabs Sahadevan.
