These incidents educate Sudeep that those who are make some mistakes they themselves correct and apologies next when Sudeep rushing to see off his lover at the Ooty railway station, accidentally knocks an unknown young woman, Radha (Sudha Rani), into the path of a moving train.

Radha accepts his offer too, but continues to hunt for the man who knocked her over.
