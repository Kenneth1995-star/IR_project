Kudirithe Cup Coffee

Kudirithe Kappu Coffee is a simple story. Venu (Varun Sandesh), son of Giridhar (Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao) hates love after his dear friend Ravi commits suicide due to love failure. Lasya (Suma Bhattacharya) on the other hand is a student of hotel management who has a granny Malati (Sukumari), at Dakshinagiri hill station in AP border. Lasya's dream is to make her granny's coffee shoppe into a resort. Incidentally, Giridhar is a student of Malati. Giridhar has a coffee shoppe in Dakshinagiri in which Malati lives in.
Malati is under the impression that it belonged to her son. Once she realises it is not her property but Giridhar's, she decides to give it back to him. But she also has to repay the loan of Mohan (Tanikella Bharani) who operates Decent Lodge in Dakshinagiri. In such conditions, Giridhar sends Venu to take care of Malati and the coffee shoppe. Venu turns the coffee shoppe into a wedding venue and offers tourism packages to corporate but never reveals his identity. The rest of the story is about the conflict between Lasya and Venu, the property confusion, Mohan's plans and whether Venu and Lasya fall in love.
