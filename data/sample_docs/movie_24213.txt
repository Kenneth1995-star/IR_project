Chandrasena

Indrajit, brother of Ravana, has Rama and Lakshmana kidnapped by Ahiravan and Mahiravana. Mahi hides them away in Pataal. Hanuman, the monkey-god, goes to their help. He is stopped by Makardhwaja whom he defeats. Makar takes him to Chandrasena, wife of mahi who worships Rama and desires to spend her life with him. With her help, Hanuman manages to defeat the entire army of Mahi and ultimately Mahi himself when he continues to multiply into a vast army. Chandrasena tells Hanuman the secret of destroying Mahi because of which he is able to release Rama and Lakshmana from Pataal.
