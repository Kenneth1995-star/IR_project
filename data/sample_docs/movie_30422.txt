Citizen

A district collector, a judge, and a police official are all kidnapped in broad daylight. The kidnapper calls himself 'Citizen' and appears in various disguises to get at his targets. C.B.I. officer Sarojini (Nagma) finally traces the common factor among the kidnapped trio to the fictional hamlet of Athippatti, inhabited by fishermen, but to her surprise, the village does not appear on the official gazette maps. Excavations reveal evidence of a massacre that must have taken place a couple of decades previously. 'Citizen' is finally apprehended. He explains that as a child he was the sole survivor of the massacre twenty years previously, and reveals that the three kidnapped officials perpetrated the massacre to gain power and money, and he wants the citizenship of the three government officials and their families to be revoked as a punishment for their atrocities.
