Sundown Jim

Into the town of Resurrection rides a lawman, "Sundown" Jim Majors, who finds himself in the middle of a feud. A rancher's daughter, Tony Black, is angry because her father was shot by hired guns working for rival rancher Andrew Barr, including outlaw Ben Moffitt.
Jim intervenes, retrieving U.S. mail stolen by the gang and meeting Barr's daughter Catherine, who knows that her father hired gunmen after causing anger with recent land transactions. Moffitt eventually double-crosses Barr, killing him, before Jim defeats him and his gang with Tony's help. Offered to stay as the town's new marshal, Jim accepts and begins planning a wedding with Catherine.
