During the time of a festival, the King of Gandhara was killed by his younger brother Prachanda (Gummadi) the army commander of the kingdom. At that time the Prince Pratap (N. T. Rama Rao) was away at that time, comes to know about his father's death and returns to the kingdom. On the way, Prachanda makes an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the prince, Pratap in order to place his son Bhajaranga (Padmanabham) on the throne where he is wounded. While he is unconscious, a girl Pramila (Rajasulochana) belonging to a rebel group takes him to the palace on her cart. Believing his uncle Prachanda’s words, Pratap orders the execution of a few persons held responsible for his father’s murder and they include Pramila’s brother and rebel leader Soorasena (Rajanala)’s father. Pramila vows to kill Pratap not knowing the Paradesi she met and Pratap are one and the same. Meanwhile, Pratap learns that Prachanda was responsible for his father’s death. His mother (Kannamba) restrains him from taking revenge immediately and advise him to first win people’s confidence and set up an army to fight the powerful Prachanda. The cloak and dagger drama follows. Pratap acts as a madcap, disguises as a black cobra, leads the rebel gang, kills Prachanda, ascends the throne and marries Pramila
