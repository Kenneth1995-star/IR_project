 Last Cab To Darwin

Taking advantage of the controversial Northern Territory's Voluntary euthanasia law Rex decides to end his own life with dignity. His request under the law is in bitter dispute but Rex sells up everything he owned, says goodbye to his neighbor and good friend Polly, and drives the great distance from Broken Hill, New South Wales to Darwin, Northern Territory where taking his own life would be legal.[6]
