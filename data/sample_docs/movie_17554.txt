Fortress

Sally Jones, a teacher, and her students at a small rural school in Australia are kidnapped and held for ransom by a band of violent shotgun-wielding masked thugs wearing Christmas character masks. Held for ransom in a cave, she and the children escape from their captors, are pursued, establish a stronghold, and fight for their lives.
