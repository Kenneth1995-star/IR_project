Karmayogi

Shankar (Raaj Kumar) was earlier betrayed and swindled by many people in his life, leading to poverty and hardships. He takes the path of crime which yields the instant result (money) to him. His wife, Durga (Mala Sinha) is a highly religious and pious woman who firmly believes in the teachings of Geeta. Shankar feels that he and Durga cannot live together as husband and wife. Hence, he leaves her along with his son Mohan. He leaves his village and shifts to the city of Mumbai. He teaches his son to steal and rob people. The father-son duo commits crimes in association with Keshav Lal (Ajit) and his confidant - Bhiku Ghasi Ram (Dheeraj Kumar).
On the other hand, Durga faces immense hardships. Shankar left his wife Durga when she was pregnant. Durga is forced to leave the house as it has been attached by the court due to non-payment of loans taken by Shankar against that. Durga gives birth to her second son who grows up as an idealist - Ajay (Jeetendra) as he has been groomed by the good teachings and nice Samsakaras of his mother. Ajay is a lawyer, but he runs a newspaper also, named as - Karmayogi. Keshav Lal conspires against Shankar and gets him caught by the police. Since Shankar has murdered a police officer, he gets the death penalty. Later, Mohan happens to meet his separated mother and younger brother, but he has already chosen his end and after seeking his revenge from the conspirators follows his father to the gallows. However, in his ending moments, his mother is there to recite the couplets of Geeta to him. These couplets are not only those belonging to the concept of Karma, but also the concepts of soul and rebirth as explained by Lord Krishna.
