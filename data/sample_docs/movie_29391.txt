Vivasayee

Somewhere in the Tamil country, in one of its vast green campaigns...
Muthaiya (MGR), a young agronomist and a farmer, full of ingenuity, a high integrity, a worker and a pride of his parents, the rich big landowner, The Pannaiyar Duraiswamy (Major Sundarrajan) and of his wife, devoted Sivagami (S. N. Lakshmi), revolutionize the exploitation of his father, by applying new methods of sowings.
He (MGR) so hopes to multiply tenfold the yield for humanitarian purposes and not necessarily or only lucrative.
Because one day, he takes the defense of unfortunate farmers despoiled of their ground, by his neighbor, another big farmer, The Pannaiyar Velupandhiyan (M. N. Nambiar), a being without scruples, Muthaiya incurs the wrath of this very vindictive character.
The situation complicates when very attractive Vidjaya (K. R. Vijaya) falls in love with the beautiful Muthaiya.
Indeed, she (K. R. Vijaya) is to be the sister-in-law of Velupandhiyan. And that the latter desired her ardently under the nose of his wife, very believer Kaveri (C. R. Vijayakumari).
To see her taking off between the fingers, makes him (M. N. Nambiar) particularly dangerous and obnoxious with his wife, Kaveri.
Now, Muthaiya is even more in danger, Velupandhiyan wants to kill him...
