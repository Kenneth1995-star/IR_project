The Little Damozel

Gambler Recky Poole (James Rennie) accepts a bet to marry Julie Alardy (Anna Neagle), a night club danseuse. After the wedding, Recky unexpectedly fall in love with her, but Julia decides to divorce him and go back to dancing. A despairing Recky contemplates suicide, contriving to make it look like an accident so that Julia will be able to collect the insurance. Luckily, she returns to him before it is too late, and they live a life of wedded bliss.
