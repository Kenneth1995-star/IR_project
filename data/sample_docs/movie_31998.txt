Ketu Duplicatu

Vijay (Rajendra Prasad) teases everyone with his naughty bets, Usha (Surabhi) has the same habit. They constantly quarrel with each other but finally the quarrel leads to love and they are engaged. At the same time, Vijay's close friend Ajay (Sivaji Raja) has cancer, and, to protect him, Vijay manipulates and uses his office medical allowance by changing reports into his name. But, unfortunately, Ajay dies, and Vijay may be arrested for misusing his medical facilities. So Vijay pretends that he has died first. Simultaneously Vijay's co-employee Dharmalingam (Suthi Velu) steals 3 lakhs rupees from the office and puts the blame on Vijay. Another co-employee Rita (Haarika) who is always insulted by Vijay claims that she is carrying Vijay's child. Now Vijay is surrounded by difficulties and to solve these problems Vijay turns into a duplicate ghost.
