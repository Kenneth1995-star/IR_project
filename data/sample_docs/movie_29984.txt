Aravind (Saravanan) and Parthasarathy (Selva) are small-time crooks who don't have any relatives. They meet each other in subjail, and the two soon become good friends. After their release from jail, Aravind doesn't know where to go so Parthasarathy accommodates him at his home.
Both continue to steal. One day, they steal money from an old village man Korai Kaluthu Kuppusamy (Kuladeivam Rajagopal). The next day, the old man dies from heart attack. Felt guily, Aravind tries to help the late Kuppusamy's family. Aravind decides to become a good man but Parthasarathy does not want to change and strongly believe that the society will not accept it. Aravind gets married with Anandavalli (Sithara) who hides a former prostitute. Meanwhile, Parthasarathy fall in love with Kuppusamy's granddaughter Daisy (Nandhini). Parthasarathy then clashes with the dreaded don Kondaiah (Chitti). What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
