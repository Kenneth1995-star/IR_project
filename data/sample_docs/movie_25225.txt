Satte Pe Satta

Satte Pe Satta is the story of seven brothers living on a large farmhouse. The first half of the movie shows the life of the brothers who grew up under the leadership of their oldest brother Ravi (Amitabh Bachchan). Being orphans and uneducated, all seven brothers are unsophisticated bumpkins and lack social etiquette and hygiene. They live on a small farm among animals. A sequence of events leads Ravi to fall in love with a nurse named Indu (Hema Malini). Indu despises unruliness and chaos. Therefore, Ravi tricks her into believing that he has only 1 younger brother, Shani and thus Indu eventually marries him only to realize he has five more brothers, all uneducated and uncouth. Ravi's six brothers learn to adjust with new woman in their lives as she does with them, trying to civilize them. Soon enough, they all fall in love with a group of six women, friends with an heiress (and the feeling is mutual). Shortly things take a turn when Babu, Ravi's lookalike, is hired by the heiress's guardian, Ranjit Singh, to kill her for possession of her ancestral property.
