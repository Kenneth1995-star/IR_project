Konchem Ishtam Konchem Kashtam

Geeta (Tamannaah) 18 grows up in a village, under the shade of her doting father Subramanyam (Nassar) 51 who takes care of everything for her and she is equally attached to him. She comes to Hyderabad for higher studies and stays at her uncle, Gachibowli Diwakar's (Brahmanandam)47 house. There she meets with Siddharth/Siddhu (Siddharth)20, friend of her cousin. Eventually they grow close and fall in love.
Though Siddhu was a playful, carefree young chap, he has problems at his home as his parents are divorced. He reveals that to Geeta and tells her that he is coming to her village to meet his father. There he asks Geeta's hand in marriage but Subramanyam doesn't agree. He says that he couldn't marry his daughter to a person whose parents are divorced. He wants to give his daughter in a big family but at least he wants his parents to be together. Siddhhu asks him whether he would agree to marriage if his parents reunite and Subramanyam agrees to that.
From then on start the efforts and trials of both Siddhu and Geetha to get Prakash (Prakash Raj) 47 and Rajyalakshmi (Ramya Krishna)43 together. One night, when Prakash is driving Siddhu to his mother's home, they talk about when his parents separated. His father understands his feelings and what he's trying to say, and his father answers "that he couldn't have done anything,his mother just left him." To this Siddhu answers, "No, you should have gone after her. You should have never let her go." Even after this talk with Prakash, Geeta and Siddhu have lots of failures, but eventually Siddhu unites his parents together and Geeta's father, Subramanyam, also unites the other lovers, Geeta and Siddhu in this fun loving family movie. They marry in Tirupati Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and delivers 2 babies.
