Felix and Meira

In Mile End, Montreal, a Hassidic Jewish woman named Meira lives a miserable life, married to Shulem who does not allow her to listen to secular music. They have a young daughter named Elishiva, but Meira confides in her friend that she does not want any more children, despite their religious duty. Word reaches Shulem, who berates Meira for shaming the small family. By chance, Meira meets Félix, a French Canadian man who has just lost his father Théodore, who at the end of his life no longer knew Félix was his son. Meira is mystified by the fact that Félix has no children, as he is single, a novel concept for her as she comes from a culture where women have as many as 14 children. She avoids eye contact with him, and becomes enraged when, while they are playing Ping-Pong, Félix's sister Caroline unexpectedly arrives and sees her.
Félix and Meira go out dancing. Caroline also informs Félix that their mother had an affair, drawing parallel to Félix's interest in a married woman. Eventually, Shulem sees Félix and Meira walking on a street together, rushes up behind them and begins slapping Félix.
Later, Shulem visits Félix in his apartment, informing him that if Meira and Félix reunite, Meira will never be allowed to return to the Hassidic community. Shulem also asks Félix to keep Meira safe and cared for. Before leaving, Shulem notices a folded up piece of paper, that Félix says was written by Théodore and never read. Shulem reads it, revealing Théodore apologized for bullying Félix to conform to the family, where he never felt comfortable. Félix and Meira take Elishiva to Venice.
