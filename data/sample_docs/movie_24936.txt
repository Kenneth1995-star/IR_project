Do Jasoos

Dharamchand and Karamchand, (Raj Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar) are two detectives who are on the trail of a millionaire's missing daughter (Bhavana Bhatt). In their efforts to save the girl, who is an eye-witness to a murder, they fall headlong into a series of comic situations because the photograph they have is that of the friend of Bhavana. Eventually, they also succeed in busting a smugglers' gang. A rollicking comedy, starring Raj Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar, who've being seen together in very different roles, e.g. after an intense love story like Sangam. The film is directed by Naresh Kumar and has music by Ravindra Jain. The supporting cast includes Shailendra Singh and Prem Chopra.
The film has beautiful songs of Rafi Saab, Mukeshji, Asha Bhosle and newcomer Shailendra Singh. Despite the humorous comedies in the film with class one singers and actors, it had average business.
