No Time to Die

In North Africa during the Second World War, a squadron of British tanks is destroyed in battle by panzers of their German adversaries.
A tank commanded by American Sgt. David Thatcher (Victor Mature) is hit and he and driver Trooper "Tiger" Noakes (Anthony Newley) bail out. The squadron's attached reconnaissance vehicle, commanded by Sgt. Kendall (Leo Genn), becomes stuck in the sand and the crew bail out too.
The three survivors are quickly captured and transported to an Italian-run POW camp. Thatcher has a secret and tries to escape at every turn.
