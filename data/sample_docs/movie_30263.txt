Kaadhal Mannan

Rudran (Girish Karnad), a very strict disciplinarian father of two daughters, hates the word 'Love'. The very mention of this word makes him punish himself to unimaginable heights. He disowns his elder daughter Menaka because she elopes with her lover. The strictness is doubled for the younger daughter Thilottama (Maanu) and a marriage alliance is fixed for her. She stoically accepts her father's decision till she meets a local mechanic Shiva (Ajith). Shiva lives with his friend Oyya (Vivek) in a mansion owned by Mess Viswanthan (M. S. Viswanathan), Shiva is always ready to accept dares. When he is dared to go to Delhi by a woman to deliver a letter to her soon-to-be-engaged sister, Thilothama, Shiva ends up falling in love with Thilothama. But Tilottama is unable to reveal her love to Shiva and to her father, as she fears the consequences. Are the lovers able to declare their love for each other and get united? Does Rudran take to it kindly?
