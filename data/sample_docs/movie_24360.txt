Maa

Chanderbabu (Nazir Hussain), a retired postmaster, lives in the village with his wife and two sons, Rajan (Paul Mahendra) and Bhanu (Bharat Bhushan). He continues to live there and work for the Zamindar (landowner), while his children are getting their education. Rajan is studying for his law exam. He is married to a girl (Padma) from a wealthy family whose haughty ways alarm and frighten him. Bhanu, the younger brother is fun-loving but studious. He gets influenced by the Nationalist Movement in the campus and stops his education in the last year of college. His father is disappointed and feels that Rajan is the one they can depend upon in their old age. Bhanu meets Meena (Shyama), and the two fall in love. Meera's father, Ramnarayan, is the school Principal and is impressed by Bhanu. He decides to get Meera married to Bhanu.
Rajan's law exams are nearing and he needs Rs. 300 to pay the fees. His wife refuses to get him the money. Chanderbabu tries all avenues to get the money, but fails to do so. Bhanu, returning from a fair one night hears the cries of "Thief, thief". He sees his father being pursued by a crowd and immediately runs ahead of them. The crowd thinking him to be the thief, hand him over to the police. He is jailed for one year. On his return Rajan, who by now has passed his exam, refuses to let him meet their father. The father is ashamed and wants to apologise to Bhanu for suffering on his account. He is sick in bed, but when he hears of Bhanu coming to meet him he tries rushing out, but dies. Bhanu leaves from there thinking his parents don't want to meet him.
The mother is now bereft and insanely roaming the streets looking for Bhanu. She's informed that Bhanu is dead, and she now lives as a maidservant in her son Rajan's house. Finally, with Meena's help Bhanu meets his mother and takes her away from Rajan's house.
