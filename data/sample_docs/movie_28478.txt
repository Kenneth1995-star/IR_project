Mamachan (Biju Menon), is a 41-year-old man who is still unmarried because he had to take responsibility of his family due to his fathers' early demise. His father was a politician, but could not make an earning out of it. Once Mamachan went to a police station to meet some people who are known to him, but the police mistakes him for a politician since he was wearing Khadar(Khadi attire). Mamachan understands the potential of the Khadar and becomes a politician.
Instead of joining existing political parties which have a strong foothold in Kerala, he joins a national party who hardly has any workers in Kerala and thus becomes the national leader. Later, this party makes an alliance with the main political party in Kerala and thus Mamachan becomes a candidate for them in the next election. Mamachan's chances of winning are pale because he is considered to be shrewd. He has a lot of enemies in his village because of his nature. During this time, Mamachan falls in love with a girl he meets in the church, but it turns out that she is the daughter of a girl Mamachan used to like in his child hood. Because of this, his lovers father does not like Mamachan and is against the marriage. But eventually Mamachan uses his shrewd tactics to win the election and the girl he loved as well.
