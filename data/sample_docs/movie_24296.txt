Lal Haveli

The aristrocratic Thakur (Badri Prasad), lives in the Lal Haveli (Red Mansion) with his younger daughter Mukta (Noor Jehan). The Thakur's honour has taken a tragic hit when his older daughter, Lal Kunwar elopes with a common soldier. Though the house is run in the old lavish manner, there is shortage of funds, with the mansion being mortgaged to an old Rajput friend, Lacchman Singh.
Mukta and Anand (Surendra) have been childhood friends, who fall in love when they grow up and vow to marry. Anand is the unemployed son of an ex-soldier and a near neighbour of Mukta. Manglu (Yakub), a rough-neck but street smart, is a close friend of Anand and the two are always together, and helpful to each other.
Thakur asks Mukta to attend the wedding of Lachhman Singh's daughter in the city. There she meets the suave Jawahar, Lachhman's son, who falls in love with her and wants to marry her. Her father is pleased with the idea, especially since he's in debt to Lachhman. Mukta agrees to the pleas of her ailing father. Jawahar comes for a visit to the Thakur's house and Anand in a jealous rage shoots at him, wounding him grievously. Manglu and Anand then leave the village and join the army from where they are sent to war.
The injured Jawahar requires blood transfusion to save his life. Mukta's blood matches and she is able to help Jawahar by donating her blood. At the marriage ceremony, the Pandit (priest) (Kanhaiyalal), stops the wedding saying that since Mukta's blood runs in Jawaharâ€™s body, they are now brother and sister. This reasoning appeals to the old-fashioned Thakur, who calls off the wedding. Anand receives an injury during the war and is sent home from the army. Manglu too comes back bringing a nurse he met in the hospital as his bride. Finally, Jawahar, after some initial resistance accepts Mukta as his sister and gives her hand in marriage to Anand.
