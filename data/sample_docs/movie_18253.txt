The Man from Toronto

Lawyer Bunston (Frederick Kerr) presides over an eccentric will stipulating that the Canadian Fergus Wimbush (Ian Hunter) and the English Leslie Farrar (Jessie Matthews) will inherit a million if they wed. As the couple have never met, when the man from Toronto comes to England, Leslie poses as a parlour maid, in order to better make his acquaintance, and the two fall in love anyway.
