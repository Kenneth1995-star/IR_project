Treasure Inn

Master Kung and Lo Pa are two police officers of White Horse City, who have high skills but are underused. An opportunity to prove themselves arises when a robbery takes place at the home of the city's richest man, Ho Pak Man, in which his whole family is killed and the family treasure, the "White Jade Goddess of Mercy," is stolen. Their chance for glory is cut short, however, when the "Police God" Tit Mo Ching is called in to investigate the case. He bars Kung and Lo Pa from further participation in the investigation because of their low status.
Coincidentally, Master Kung and Lo Pa arrest a pair of twin sisters, Water Dragon Girl and Fire Dragon Girl, who always pretend to catch wanted criminals to get monetary rewards. The twin sisters know that the "White Jade Goddess of Mercy" would be brought to the "Treasure Inn" for an auction. Wanting to hit big, Master Kung and Lo Pa go to the "Treasure Inn" with the twin sisters to investigate the truth. During that time, Master Kung and Water Dragon Girl become lovers.
