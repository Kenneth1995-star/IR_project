Kaalai

Jeeva (Silambarasan) shares his name with two other people - one villain and one cop-turned-baddie and the situations arising out of it promise enough curiosity for a while as soon as the movie opens.
Jeeva’s grandmother – slays five men, mind you when she was only nine, since they flouted her father’s advices and distilled alcohol illegally in the village also involving in other shady activities. The villagers, for her noble act, consider her their head after her return from the prison and are peaceful under her reign. However, trouble crops up in the name of a police officer – Jeeva(Lal) – whose ego is hurt when challenged by the fellow policeman’s son that he can’t find anything illicit in Jeeva’s village, ruled by the godmother Karuppayi Aatha (Seema).
Jeeva tries - but to no avail - to nail somebody from the village for any charges and ends being thrashed up the villagers. Predictably, he returns with a vengeance and in the dirty war, burns Karuppayi Aatha alive. Enough reason for to seek retribution for his loss. Jeeva returns to Chennai, uses the tried and tested formula to woo Jeeva’s daughter Brindha, and after a couple of duets abducts her as a hostage on revenge of his grandmother.
