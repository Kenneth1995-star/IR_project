Devils of Darkness

Its plot involves a group of vampires and satanic worshippers, led by Count Sinistre, who search out fresh victims. The film begins in a small town in Brittany, primarily inhabited by gypsies, where Baxter is on holiday with a group of friends. Count Sinistre returns to terrorise the townspeople on All Soul's Night, and murders three of Baxter's friends. Baxter, initially sceptical of the supernatural nature of the town, becomes suspicious and returns to England with a talisman belonging to Sinistre which he had taken from the scene of one of his murders, leading Sinistre to pursue Baxter in an attempt to recover the talisman and murder acquaintances along the way.
