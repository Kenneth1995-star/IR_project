Nidra (നിദ്ര)

Raju (Siddharth Bharathan) is the younger son from a wealthy family. Raju, who was in Germany to do space research, was not informed of his mother's demise and has a nervous breakdown when he gets the news. He takes a couple of years to recover. After that he marries his childhood sweetheart Ashwathy (Rima Kallingal). She is the daughter of their former family chauffeur and the marriage took place much against her mother's wishes. Ashwathy barely has an idea as to what lies in store as Raju has had a history of mental unsteadiness. She has heard about his illness, that he has been mentally disturbed after his mother's death but now, she has to face the situation with virtually no support.
Raju lives in a world of his own, away from all the business deals and money, unlike his elder brother Vishwan (Jishnu). But his near and dear ones look at every action of his through the prism of his past illness, which frustrates him. It does not help that he has a rather short temper. To add to the oddities, he has converted his bedroom into a space research lab and dreams of building an organically self-sustainable world for himself and his wife in the middle of the family's rubber estate. Vishwan has plans to build a resort catering to foreign clients. All this makes Raju very angry and violent, and people begin to think that his illness has resurfaced. Ashwathy is determined to get him back to life with her love. She almost succeeds, but the people around them were not so bothered about compassion, tender human emotions and selfless love.
