Sagar (Jagapathi Babu) is an easy-going youngster who leads a content life with his widowed mother (Sudha), sister Chanti (Prathyusha), girlfriend Rajya Lakshmi (Sakshi Sivanand) and friends. Chepala Krishna (Tanikella Bharani) and his younger brother Chepala Nani (Ravi Teja) are the noted smugglers in Vizag. Krishna has a lifetime ambition to become an MLA. Sagar & Nani always have clashes from childhood.
C.I. Srihari (Srihari) is an honest Police Officer newly appointed to that area. Krishnam Raju (Sivaji Raja) S.I. of the same area is very loyal to him. Both of them get to know about all the criminals in that area and Krishna tops the most wanted criminals list. When Krishna is about to file his nominations for the post of an M.L.A, he gets arrested by Srihari. Srihari makes sure that Krishna would not go to the assembly by booking him as a rowdy sheeter. For that Krishna develops enmity on Srihari. One day Srihari gets information that Nani is doing smuggling at a particular place. Srihari spots Nani and starts chasing him with the help of Krishnam Raju. At the same time Sagar's sister's marriage arrangements are going on. Sagar goes to the bazaar to buy something. As the chasing gang enters a gully, Nani and Krishnam Raju kill Srihari. Sagar sees everything and tries to rescue Srihari but is implicated in the murder and sentenced for his life.
Nukaraju (Prakash Raj) is a humble constable, who is transferred to that area. He is an avid admirer of late Srihari. Sagar's mother is hospitalized when she resists Nani who tried to rape the sister of Sagar. Nukaraju is on duty to accompany Sagar to the hospital to visit Sagar's mom. There Sagar gives Nukaraju the slip and escapes from the hospital and targets Krishna, Nani, and Krishnam Raju. The remaining story is how Sagar proves his innocence.
