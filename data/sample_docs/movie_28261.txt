Killadi Raman (കില്ലാടി രാമൻ)

Killadi Raman is about the vagaries and paradoxes of life. Mahadevan's (Mukesh) life takes a turn when he witnesses an accident, where Radhika (Priya Lal) has been hit by a vehicle. He takes her to a hospital but it only lands him in more trouble, when Meera (Megha Nair), Radhika's friend, approaches him.
