The Road to Sampo

With little money left and no work during winter, Roh Young-dal (Baek Il-seob), a young construction worker is at a loss where to go when he meets a middle-aged man named Jeong (Kim Jin-kyu) who is on his way back to his hometown. Jeong gets by doing odd jobs using skills he learned while serving time in prison. After more than ten years' absence, he is homesick and dreams of his hometown, Sampo, where he can fish in the sea and tend his crops.[1][4]
Young-dal and Jeong meet Baek-hwa (Mun Suk), a runaway waitress at a restaurant in town and the three of them begin their journey together. At first, Young-dal and Baek-hwa argue constantly but soon become attached to each other. As they continue their travel to the train station, each reminisces about his or her past.
At the train station, Young-dal buys Baek-hwa a ticket for her onward journey, hinting at a farewell. He and Jeong then depart for Sampo. After finding a job, Young-dal leaves Jeong. When Jeong finally arrives in Sampo, he is shocked to see how his hometown has changed.
