Always Be With You

David, a taxi driver with lung cancer, kills vacation property owner Patrick in a freak car accident. Off-duty police officer Sam and his wife Si seemingly were able to avoid the collision. At the same time, Siu-hung, who broke up with her fiancé, committed suicide by jumping off a building, landing right on top of Patrick's car. Chi-keung is a crematorium worker who is saddled with huge gambling debts. He steals a pair of pricey gold bracelets, the funerary objects of Siu-hung, to pay off his debts. Patrick's fiancée, Yu Xin, recovered from the tragedy and hopes to fulfil Patrick's last wish in running a suburban vacation house. However, a series of strange happenings keeps on occurring in the vacation house. Singer Jamie's vinyl, which Si got from a second hand shop, keeps appearing at Sam and Si's apartment even though they have disposed it a few times. It is later revealed that the series of strange events that happened are tied to the people who are involved in the car accident.
