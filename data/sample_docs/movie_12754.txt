After hearing of Panzram's harsh imprisonment, Lesser befriends him and convinces him to write a biography. 40 years after the execution of Panzram, Lesser found a writer for a book that would contain the writings of Carl Panzram and the circumstances of Panzram's many incarcerations over the course of his life.
