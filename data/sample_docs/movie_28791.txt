It is their another effort at getting together their 4 children and their extended families. Their children and grandchildren are located in different cities and over time the family has lost touch due to unresolved issues from the past. However, the grandchildren i.e. the two young cousins are still close.
Their daughter (Manju) played by Sai Tamhankar who is married to a guy from a different cast who is elder to her (referred as of Father's age in one scene) will be coming home and meeting the family after 6 years.

The film takes an emotional turn in the second half with the sudden demise of Bhai just before the arrival of the children at home. Malati is shocked with this sudden development.
