Sati Savithri

Savitri (S. Varalakshmi) the only daughter of Aswapathi Maharaja (Chittor V. Nagaiah), King of Madra has married to Satyavantha (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), son of a blind King Dyumatsena Maharaja (Dora Swamy) who lived in exile as a forest-dweller. Knowing well that Satyavantha has only a year to live after marriage, she marries him. On the day he is to die Satyavantha is cutting the wood, he suddenly gets dizzy and lays his head in Savitri's lap. Yama Dharma Raju (S. V. Ranga Rao) himself descends on earth to claim his soul. Savitri follows him and when Yama Dharma Raju tries to convince her to go back, she persists.
Impressed with her persuasive speech he grants her three boons; anything except bringing back Satyavan to life. She first asks him to restore her father-in-law's eyesight and kingdom, and then she asks for hundred sons for her father and finally hundred sons for herself and Satyavantha. The last wish creates an awkward situation for Yama Dharma Raja. Finally, he grants Satyavantha back his life and blesses Savitri.
