Noynoy's presidential campaigns everywhere. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Divine, initially discouraged him,was forced to agree. He covered Senator Aquino's campaigns from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, everytime, from sunrise to midnight, from live coverage to record editing. His older brother, Bong, crippled by polio, jealous at Noy at his lucky streak, unintentionally joined a notorious group at drug dealing.
Meanwhile, some jealous TV presenters investigated Noy's background. They reported it on Jane. Noy was immediately summoned and fired when they found out about his fake identity, but gave him one last shot to cover Sen. Aquino's campaign in Tarlac.
He returned in his home in Artex Compound, just to see his brother being mauled by two thugs. He was spotted and killed by one of the thugs, falling his body in the floodwater.
In the end of the film, Noy's family observed his death by lighting in the front of his portrait. Simultaneously, Senator Noynoy made his speech in front of the crowds gathered during his campaign.
The film, infused with actual documentary footage inter-cut with dramatic scenes mixed with countless presidential campaign slogans, deals with themes of poverty, survival and hope for the Filipino family.
