Hurricanger vs. Gaoranger

In the Hayate Way's Ninja Academy, three pupils are not exactly fitting in. But because their sensei believes they have potential he regularly spends the morning personally and rigorously training them. While the other students are having their graduation ceremony a group of evil space ninjas known as the Jakanja infiltrate the school killing most of the students. The school's sensei, Mugensai, turns himself into a hamster to evade his pursuers. The trio is then taken to a secret base to become the legendary Hurricangers to fight Jakanja. Later in the series they have to fight with the two ninja brothers of the Ikazuchi Way's Ninja Academy due to their respective schools' rivalries. With the aid of the mysterious Shurikenger the two ninja groups set their rivalry aside and join forces to stop Jakanja.
