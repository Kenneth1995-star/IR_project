Holud Pakhir Dana

Riju (Dibyendu Mukherjee) is a doctor who was severely harmed when he got hit by a car. The car belonged to Saheli (Rimjhim Gupta), who is also a doctor. Saheli then tried to nurse Riju so that he came back to his health. She kept Riju at her residence for a period and as days passed, they fell in love. When Riju returned home, he discovered that his mother (Anuradha Ray) had died. He then went to Mathurapur when a doctor called him from there to inform him that a lot of villagers were ill due to consumption of spurious liquor. On the other hand, one day, Saheli came to know that she had cancer and she went to the "Painless Life Centre" and stayed there. Riju tried to find out the whereabouts of Saheli one day since they had not been in touch for a very long time. He landed up at the Centre one day and took Saheli back home as he wanted her to be by his side during her last days. She died after a few days.[1]
