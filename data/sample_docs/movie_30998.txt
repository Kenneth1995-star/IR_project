Sura

Sura (Vijay) was born and brought up in Yaazh Nagar, a fishermen hamlet in coastal Tamil Nadu, in the company of his friend, Ambar La, alias Umbrella (Vadivelu). Meanwhile, he comes across young bubbly Poornima (Tamannaah) who chooses to end her life unable to cope up with the death of her pet dog.
Slowly, she becomes attracted towards Sura thanks to his good deeds, and they start romancing. When things seem to go well, trouble enters in the form of a greedy and corrupt Minister Samuthira Raja(Dev Gill). He wants to usurp the land where these fishermen live, but his attempts to take away the wealth are resisted by Sura. They cross fight each other. The Minister hatches a conspiracy to bump off Sura with the help of his Ministerial post and authority and sues him. Sura takes them on single-handedly and finally destroys his bad intention and help his town fishermen to get their own houses as he wished.
However, the Minister is plotting revenge against Sura for taking his money and because he had lost that land in which he was about to build a fair.
He plants a bomb and when Sura sees minister's henchmen he started running and minister caught him and said we planted bomb in your village. Sura said the chief guest is none other than your wife and he was shocked and Sura deactivated bomb and he killed the minister
