Hurt

Hurt is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Alan Zweig and released in 2015.[1] The film explores the troubled life of Steve Fonyo, the Canadian amputee athlete who completed a cross-Canada run that was known as the "Journey for Lives" to raise funds for cancer research in 1984 and 1985. The film clearly Showcases's Steve's resilience, not only the kind that kept an 18-year-old cancer survivor running the equivalent of a half marathon a day for 400 days for 7924 km. In addition to Steve's 400 day run, the movie also depicts the downfalls of his life. Some of these include: coke addiction, excessive drinking, surviving East Hastings, numerous stints in jail, having his prosthetic leg stolen, and being beaten and stabbed multiple times. Director, Alan Zweig, wanted to show how a person can turn their life around in a matter of years even though some may view this individual as a national hero. [2]
