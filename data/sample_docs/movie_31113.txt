Sera (Krishna) is a guy who earns his living by retrieving dead bodies from Kodaikanal's Green Valley View suicide point. Nandu (Karunas), Shanmugam (Thambi Ramaiah) and a mute friend are part of Sera's crew. Sera meets Kavitha (Bindu Madhavi) when he and his crew retrieve her sister's body from a gully, after the sister had committed suicide with her boyfriend. Kavitha gradually falls in love with Sera. A parallel plot is of Iyya (Jayaprakash), who trades in stolen tea, with corrupt officials turning a blind eye to his activities.
Iyya's gang kills four police officers during a raid and throw the dead bodies from the suicide point. Iyya, who knows Shanmugam, threatens him not to retrieve the bodies of the police officers during investigation. Fearing for their lives, Shanmugam tries to convince Sera not to retrieve the bodies. Brushing aside Shanmugam's fears, Sera's crew retrieves the bodies of the police officers due to a sense of duty. After retrieving the bodies, Sera informs the police of the murder by Iyya, resulting in Iyya's arrest.
Iyya comes out in bail and his men kill Shanmugam, Nandu and the mute friend of Sera. Sera gets furious seeing their dead bodies and avenges by killing Iyyaâ€™s henchmen. Now Kavitha consoles Sera and they both decide to run away from Kodaikanal to lead a peaceful life. They both board a jeep and on the way, Iyya arrives with his men and they start attacking Sera. However, Sera retaliates and kills most of them thereby killing Iyya also. Sera rushes back to the jeep but is shocked to see Kavitha dead. Sera understands that Kavitha was accidentally stabbed to death during the fight. Sera cries loud and jumps from the mountain and kills himself along with the dead body of Kavitha.
