Pigman

Sreekumar (Jayasurya), son of an idealistic political activist Achukoodam Madhavettan (M. R. Gopakumar), is determined to get a doctorate in linguistics. Although mired in poverty, he works hard on his thesis. But his life is made difficult by his research guide and his thesis gets rejected. He decides to abandon his studies and find a job. That's when his friend, Sneha (Remya Nambeesan), helps him get a job at a pig farm. When he opposes some unhealthy practices at his workplace, he is relegated to a menial job at the pig sty. Eventually, the travails that he has to undergo shatter his youthful idealism.
