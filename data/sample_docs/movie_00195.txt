Denton (Fairbanks) is a lieutenant in the U.S. Cavalry regiment commaded by Colonel Benham (Frederick Burton). Benham is married to the much younger Estrella (Kathleen Kirkham), the daughter of wealthy rancher Canby (Theodore Roberts). Estrella has a sister, Bonita (Marjorie Daw), with whom Denton falls in love.
Denton discovers an affair between Estrella and Captain Hodgeman (Harry Northrup). In his effort to break up the affair, Denton follows Estrella to her room where Benham catches them and misunderstands what he sees. Denton honorably keeps Estrella's secret and in consequence must resign in disgrace.
Canby hires Denton as foreman of his ranch. Denton's relationship with Bonita is endangered by Hodgeman who lies to Canby about him. Hodgeman's grudge against Denton leads to a fight between the two during which Hodgeman is shot and mortally wounded. Denton is suspected, but a cowboy, Tony (Raymond Hatton), declares that he fired the shot to retaliate for Hodgeman's dealings with the girl that he loves. In the end, Estrella reveals the truth about her own indiscretion, enabling Denton and Bonita to marry with her family's blessing as well as a happy ending for Benham and Estrella.
