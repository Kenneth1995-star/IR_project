Aagatha

Kannada psychodrama based on the true-life case studies of the Pai couple, practicing psychiatrists and the film's producers. Usha (Shruthi), daughter of a retired school teacher, turns down a marriage proposal from a progressive US-based engineer in favour of university colleague Vikas (Srikant). Vikas abandons Usha when his oppressive father demands a dowry she cannot pay. After psychiatric treatment, Usha joins a rural voluntary organisation where she falls for its leader, Francis (Suresh Heblikar). The demise of her second lover after local gossip takes on religious overtones causes a further psychological crisis. The psychiatrist in the film (Girish Karnad), representing the producers, offers a sociological critique of the events.
