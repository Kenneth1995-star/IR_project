Maharadhi

Krishna (Balakrishna), a dance teacher in Chamundeshwari’s (Jayaprada) college also acts as a music teacher Bala (Balakrishna) in Chamundeshwari’s divorced husband’s school. Krishna woos their daughter Kalyani (Meera Jasmine) but when he is asked to tie the knot with her he reveals his past.
In fact, Krishna or Bala’s real name is Balayya. He is an uneducated simple guy who lives with his mother (Kovai Sarala). A dance researcher Bhairavi (Sneha) comes to his town and likes him. She makes him to love her and change his life style. The twist in the tale is that Bhairavi is the daughter of Chamundeshwari and she plays spoilsport to their love story.
