Tahqiqaat

Father Prem Fernandes (Jeetendra) is a well-respected Catholic Priest by the entire town. Bhanu Pratap (Danny Denzongpa) is a multimillionaire and head of the town, Peter, an angry young man (Aditya Pancholi) who always fights for justice and anti-rich people, is the son of coffin maker Anthony (Satyendra Kapoor). Peter's sister Mary (Farheen) and Bhanu Pratap's son Ramesh (Ronit Roy) are in love. Mary becomes pregnant, and at that time Ramesh had to leave the country for few days, so she takes Father's help to make her marriage to Ramesh, because both Bhanu Pratap and Peter respect his words. But Peter misunderstands that the Father and Mary were involved in a relationship and he blames the Father for this and assaults him. Peter gets arrested, but he escapes. Next day, Mary is hanging dead from a tree branch. Everyone thinks that she has committed suicide and she has been buried without having a postmortem. But the Father has a doubt about it, so he asks his twin brother S.P. Arun Kumar (again Jeetendra) a Police officer to have the body exhumed in order to perform a postmortem. The next day when S.P. Arun Kumar exhumes Mary's coffin, a shocking incident, he finds Father Prem Fernandes' dead body in it. Everyone suspects Peter was the culprit, and S.P. Arun Kumar immediately begins an investigation to break the mystery behind missing of Mary's dead body and the Father's death.
