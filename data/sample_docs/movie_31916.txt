Kondaveeti Donga

An orphan Kondaveeti Raja M.A.,L.L.B.,I.A.S. (Chiranjeevi) is raised through the support of people living in the tribal village of Kondaveedu. Upon his return from Hyderabad, he witnesses the failed legal system, and the village being engulfed in political corruption, forgery, smuggling, money laundering, drug trafficking, land grabbing, and alcohol abuse carried out by the local mafia and landlords (Rao Gopal Rao, Mohan Babu & Khaadra (Amrish Puri)) who impose taxes on the farmers. Instead of being in the system and taking the direct route as an administrator himself, he transforms into Robin Hood for the village, and indulges in swashbuckling heists of money and paddy worth several crores from the landlords, while being in disguise, much to the frustration of corrupt officials. He funds the tribals into self-sustaining farmers, while providing food, irrigation, healthcare, shelter, and education to the poor, and transforms the village.
