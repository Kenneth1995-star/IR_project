Tragic Theater

Many years ago, a group of construction workers were building a theater when the ceiling collapsed; many survived, but more than a hundred men died when the ceiling fell upon them. They were buried beneath the theater.
Annie (Andi Eigenmann), an engineer, wants to consult a group of exorcists and spirit mediums led by a priest (John Estrada) to help her gather information about an old theater with a dark past before she starts her project there.
But things got worse when she left the circle and is now being possessed by a demon.
