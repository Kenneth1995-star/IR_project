Rule No. 1

While on duty during an assignment, police sergeant Lee Kwok-keung shot and killed Chan Fuk-loi, a serial killer, after Chan crippled his four limbs. When Lee woke up in hospital 49 days later, the police refused to recognise his testimony because it contained information about the supernatural. His superior then transferred him to the Miscellaneous Affairs Department so that he would be on light duty.
Unlike the heroic duty of fighting crime and protecting citizens, the Miscellaneous Affairs deals with unusual cases, which is intriguing and makes people feel lost. The head of the Miscellaneous Affairs, Inspector Wong Yiu-fai, is an eccentric and beer-guzzling man. Wong and Lee work together for the Miscellaneous Affairs to solve an unusual request: to eliminate the fear of every citizen seeking help. While carrying out their duties, Wong pretentiously tells Lee the first commandment of the Miscellaneous Affairs: There are no ghosts in this world! In fact, this first commandment is just a lie. The primary task for the Miscellaneous Affairs of dealing unusual cases is to conceal supernatural incidents to the community to reduce social panic.
Just when Wong and Lee take over the case of the Saint Austina High School massacre, Chan Fuk-loi's ghost possesses Lee's wife, May, while Lee was also possessed later. The possessed Lee shoots and kills Wong and other colleagues and then makes up his own story to deceive the police.
