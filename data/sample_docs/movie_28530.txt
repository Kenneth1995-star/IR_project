Ennu Ninte Moideen

Set in the 1960s and 70s in Mukkam, Kerala, the film tells the tragic love story of Moideen who belongs to a renowned Muslim family and Kanchana Mala who is the daughter of a Hindu (Thiyya) aristocratic landlord. Since inter-religious marriages were a taboo then, the couple had to part ways as their families objected to their love affair.
Moideen shifted ground to being a socio-political activist and Kanchana Mala lived in her house under strict restrictions for 22 years. Both communicated through letters and language they had developed. Eventually Kanchanmala was caught and beaten mercilessly by her conservative relatives. Balyambra Pottattu Unni Moideen Sahib, Moideen's father stabs him since Moideen does not agree to part ways with Kanchana mala but he miraculously escapes. Moideen reveals to the judge/police that it was an accident and his father was not responsible. This confession transforms Balyambra Pottattu Unni Moideen Sahib's attitude towards his son; however, he dies immediately afterwards due to a heart attack. Eventually, Moideen and Kanchana decide to elope but when Moideen was returning after collecting their passports, he dies in a boating accident. Upon hearing about his death, Kanchana decides to commit suicide but is stopped by Moideen's mother. In the end, Kanchana leaves home to live in Moideen's house, as Moideen's unmarried widow.
