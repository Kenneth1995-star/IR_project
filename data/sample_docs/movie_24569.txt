Ghar Basake Dekho

Kamal Mehra (Sudesh Kumar) lives in the village with his mother Shanta Mehra (Lalita Pawar) and younger sister, Sharda (Rajshree). They are poor and his mother has to mortgage her house in the village in order to send Kamal to the city for further education. She expects him to pay off the mortgage once he gets a job. Kamal gets a job and returns to the village with a wife Mona (Shyama), who is considered too modern for the village. When Kamal returns to the city, he stops sending money to his family. The mother and daughter leave for the city when they are informed that Kamal is not well. They are treated badly by Mona, who with her spendthrift habits gets into arguments with Kamal. When Kamal leaves for a job outside the city, Mona has Shanta and Sharda thrown out of the house.
Wandering on the streets, Shanta and Sharda collide with Kumar's (Manoj Kumar) car, who takes them to his home. Kamal is an employee of Kumar, but the fact is unknown to mother and daughter. Kumar and Sharda start liking each other and he insists that they stay at his place till the mother recovers. When Kamal returns home, he is upset to see his mother and sister missing. He leaves some money he is carrying for his employer with Mona, and goes off to the village to look for them, but is unable to find them. Mona spends three-fourths of the money Kamal had left in her care, and he has to find a way to return the money. Finally, Kamal unites with his mother and sister; Mona has learnt her lesson from her errant ways, and Kumar and Sharda get married.
There is a sub-plot in the form of Kamal and Mona's neighbours; one is Sunder (Mehmood) and his wife Geeta (Savitri), who is shown as the traditional wife in comparison to Mona. Another neighbour is Jackson (Johnny Walker), who has left his wife Ganga (Minu Mumtaz) in the village.
