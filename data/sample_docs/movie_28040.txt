Oridathoru Puzhayundu

The film is about Sumangala (Jayasree Sivadas), a young girl from Valayapatti village in Tamil Nadu, seeking refuge in Kuriachira in Thrissur, Kerala along with her folks after a factory completely exploited the water sources in her village.
The villagers come to Kerala hoping to start a new life and settle in a private land which they found. Sumangala goes to collect old plastic articles from nearby households to make a living. Once she found a clay statue in Sandeep's (Goutham Babu) house which was made by her father earlier. As she tried to get the statue, Sandeep shouted and she hid herself in the shed near the house. Later Sandeep and friends found her and continue to hide and feed her. After a few days, Venu (K. B. Venu) and Lakshmi (Jenny Jasmine) found Sumangala and the people in the neighbourhood decides to keep her with them till her mother is found. With the help of the authorities, Venu succeeded in locating Sumangala's mother and they all happily sent her back to her village. The children were worried about how Sumangala will survive in her village without water and started collecting money to help Sumangala's villagers dig a well in Valayapatti. Venu and friends came to know about this noble cause and contributed the full amount required for digging the well and sent to Sumangala. After three months, Sandeep received a letter saying that the well in constructed but the villagers want Sandeep and friends to come an drink the first pot of water from the well. Venu and friends took the children to Valayapatti and meet Sumangala and the villagers and enjoyed the water from the well.
While returning to their homes in Kuriachira, Venu saw a packaged drinking water factory beginning construction near the river in their village. Venu realised that a similar fate as that of Valayapatti is going to fall on them also sooner.
