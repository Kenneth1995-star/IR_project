Thotti Jaya

Jayachandran (Simbu) is an orphan working in a hotel as a helper. It is assumed he gets his title name "Thotti Jaya" as he is found in a garbage bin as an infant. One day he beats and fends off a man who gets into a squabble with the hotel owner (G. M. Kumar). The following night, the hotel owner rewards him with cash and dreads him the next morning. He realizes people only respect people they fear. So he walks out from the hotel and reaches Chennai. He is spotted by Seena Thana (Pradeep Rawat) and is hired as a henchman. In an incident, Thotti Jaya gets entangled in a political and police trap. To escape from police, Thotti Jaya slips to Calcutta and goes into hiding. Meanwhile, Brinda (Gopika), a college girl from Kanyakumari, comes to Calcutta on a tour along with her friends. Pimps operating in the red light area of Calcutta take away Brinda. Thotti Jaya accidentally meets Brinda when she tries to escape from the gang. He helps Brinda escape from the gang and takes her safely to Kanyakumari. On her way back home by train, Brinda starts admiring Thotti Jaya's niceties and gradually falls in love with him. When she expresses her desire, Thotti Jaya reciprocates her love, and both decide to enter into wedlock but little does he know that Brinda is actually Seena Thana's daughter. Thotti Jaya takes away Brinda from her house and thus earns the wrath of Seena Thana. Angered by this, Seena Thana summons his rowdy gangs and plots to bump off Thotti Jaya. How Thotti Jaya accomplishes his hopes of marrying Brinda is told in the remaining part of the story.
