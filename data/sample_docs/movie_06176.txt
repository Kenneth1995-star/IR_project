Riding Shotgun

Stagecoach guard Larry Delong is ambushed by a gang of outlaws associated with a man he's searching for, Dan Marady, who murdered Delong's sister and nephew. But when he returns to the town of Deep Water, nearly everyone there believes that Delong was involved in the holdup, in which the stage driver was killed.
With no townspeople other than Orissa Flynn, his sweetheart, and Doc Winkler heeding his warnings that Marady's men are coming to rob the town, Delong is forced to take refuge in a cantina. A lynch mob forms, with deputy Tub Murphy trying to hold them off until the sheriff's posse returns.
Marady's men, including an accomplice, Pinto, rob the bank while the villagers are distracted. Delong escapes through an attic and sabotage the getaway horses of Malady's gang. A shootout results in Marady mistakenly believing, fatally, that Delong is out of bullets.
