Lahore

An Indian kickboxer defeats a Pakistani kickboxer in an asian kickboxing tournament. The event ends in a tragedy due to the Pakistani players' intemperance. The peace process initiated by the two countries struggles to gain its momentum. This is especially when the Indian hero's brother is determined to avenge his family and country during a second international bout that is being held in Lahore.[1]
