Take a Girl Like You

In one of a small set of adult roles she did during the 1970s and 1980s, Mills plays Jenny, a good girl who comes to a small British town to start a simple life. Soon she becomes the centre of male attention around the town. Leading the pack is the honest but gruff Patrick who shares one thing along with the other men: have sex with the right girl and who he and the others consider the right girl is Jenny.
