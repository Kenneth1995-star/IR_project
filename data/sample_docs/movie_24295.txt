Jwar Bhata

An elderly man has two daughters named Rama (Shamim) and Renu (Mridula) of marriageable age. When the millionaire scion Narendra (Aga Jaan), who is slated to marry Rama, disguises himself to take a peak at his future bride, he mistakes Renu for Rama, and the two fall in love. When the mistake is discovered after the wedding, Renu curses God and is kicked out the house for heresy. She meets a wandering musician named Jagdish (Dilip Kumar), before returning home to learn that her sister is pregnant and terminally ill. They are faced with the stark choice of saving the life of the mother or the foetus, until Renu makes up with God, prompting a miracle.
