Double Barrel

Laila and Majnu are two precious stones, which has value only if they are together. It is now possessed by an underworld don in Goa, who tries to sell it, in order not to lose it to his son, Gabbar, whom he despises. Don approaches two lowly thugs, Pancho and Vinci and offers it for a price of ₹10 crores. They agree and ask for a week's time to arrange the money. Billy, who is Gabbar's man, comes to know of this and offers Pancho and Vinci ₹100 crores to buy it. Pancho and Vinci gets ₹5 crores from Blacky, which actually belongs to the Tarkovs (the Russian mob in Goa). For the remaining ₹5 crores, they plan to rob the black money of Podiyadis (a local hawala gang in Kerala). While the deal happens, things get mixed up and lead to a big gang war between all the groups.
