Indriyam

A college group of anthropology students go to the remote forest are of Muthuvan Mala, under the oversight of Prof. Shankaranarayanan (Raghavan), in order to study the tribal life which had existed there. A student, Sunny (Nishanth Sagar), unknowingly unleashes the spirit of Neeli (Vani Viswanath), who is a ghost seeking revenge against the Thripangod royal family, one of whom (Devan) had killed her and her lover (Vikram). Consequently, Neeli starts killing off the students one by one and the police call for sorcerer Vadakkedath Namboothiri (Prathapachandran) to be summoned.
