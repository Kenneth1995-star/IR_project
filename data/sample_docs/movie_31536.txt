Aggi Ramudu

The film begins a Zamindar Somanatham (D. Balasubrahmanyam) lives with his daughter Sarada (Bhanumathi Ramakrishna) and his sister Kamakshamma (Rushyendramani) whose son Kumar went missing when he was 10 year old. Somanathamâ€™s wayward nephew Veerraju (Sriram) plans to marry Sarada and sends his henchman Katturi Kalayya (R. Nageswara Rao) to kidnap her. Aggi Ramudu (N. T. Rama Rao) saves her and takes her to his abode in the forest. The police Sub-Inspector (Mukkamala) and his head constable Venkata Swamy (Relangi) are on the hunt for Aggi Ramudu as he is charged with the atrocities which are actually the handiwork of Kalayya and his men supported by Veerraju and the Mangalampadu Zamindar (Mahankali Venkaiah). Sarada realizes that Aggi Ramudu is a do-gooder to society and not a criminal. She falls in love with him. As promised, Aggi Ramudu sends her home through her neighbor Abdul Rahim. On hearing that her father is held captive by Veerraju, Sarada rushes to his house. At the same time, Abdul Rahim arrives with the police. After a fight, the culprits are taken into custody. A hilarious drama follows before it is revealed that Aggi Ramudu, Abdul Rahim, and Kumar are one and the same.
