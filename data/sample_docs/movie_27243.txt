Sonali (Mamta Kulkarni) a dancer in Kaka's hotel, joins this team of three against the two mafia operating in the city.

The degree of suspicion rises, but Amit finally wipes out the misunderstanding between these two friends Vishnu and Vijay. They join each other with equal faith and then manage to smash both the Mafias. Rana and Kaka are destroyed, but at the cost of sacrificing their dear friend Amit.
