Raju Peda

Two identical boys are born on the same day to King Surendra Dev (S. V. Rangarao) and to a thief Poligadu (NTR). Twelve years later, the sick King decides to crown the Prince Narendra Dev (Master Sudhakar). His lookalike Narigadu (Master Sudhakar) tortured by his father for refusing to beg, leaves home without informing his mother Achi (Lakshmi Rajyam) and sister Malli (Ammaji). He is caught by the palace guards but is saved by the Prince. They exchange clothes and find that they look identical. Narigadu falls asleep on the Prince’s bed. Mistaking him for Narigadu, the guards throw the prince out. Thus they accidentally exchange places.
Soon the prince leaves Poligadu’s house. Sudhir (Relangi), a valiant soldier who is in love with Malli, takes care of him. Meanwhile, the king dies. The army commander Vikram Dev (R. Nageswara Rao) plots to usurp the kingdom. He learns the truth about Narigadu and compels him to act as the prince. He also plots to kill the real prince but Poligadu and Sudhir thwart his plan. In the fight that follows, Poligadu kills Vikram. Narendra Dev is crowned as the king. He orders Poligadu and his family to stay with him in the palace.
