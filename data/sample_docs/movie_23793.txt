The Mommy Returns

The Mommy Returns tells the story of a mother, Ruby (Pokwang), who dies right on the day of her 25th wedding anniversary with husband, William (Gabby Concepcion). With her untimely death, she leaves behind her three children Amethyst (Kiray Celis), Topaz (Gerald Pesigan), and Sapphire (Jillian Ward).
Ruby is also temporarily trapped in PURGA (short for Purgatory) with its guardian, Dyoga (John Lapus) and the pesky Manny, the chicken pet of San Pedro.
When Catherine (Ruffa Gutierrez), a younger and prettier woman comes into the life of William, Ruby escapes from PURGA and returns to earth as a ghost to drive Catherine out of the family she left behind.
