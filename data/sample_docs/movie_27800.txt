The elder Kurup’s daughter Aswathy (Gayathri Raghuram) is in love with her muracherukkan, Subhadra’s son Ananthu (Prithviraj), but their parents object to the match. They are encouraged by Chandutty (Jagathy Sreekumar), Bhaskaran (Tharikida Sabu) and Shankunni (Baiju). They hope that Aswathy’s brother Karthik (Rayan Raj) will come to their rescue.
