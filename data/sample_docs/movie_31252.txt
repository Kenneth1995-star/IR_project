There is also a marriage broker in this story,Vijay Sethupathy(Singam Puli),who tries very hard to find an educated girl for Sigamani. But he is unable to. Due to the fact that Sigamani is uneducated, he is easily cheated by his friends(Badava Gopi,etc...). His only trustable friend is PaalPandi(Karunakaran), who follows his wherever he goes. In desperation to get married to an educated girl, Sigamani plans to wait outside a college to find a girl to love. He then sees Nandini(Nanditha) and decides to go after her. One day, both Sigamani and PaalPandi follow Nandini and finally end up in her house.
