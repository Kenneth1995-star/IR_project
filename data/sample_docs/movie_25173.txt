Rocky

Shankar (Sunil Dutt) is an educated young man who is employed in the construction business by Ratanlal (Anwar Hussain). Shankar is also the union leader, and would like Ratanlal to enforce measures for workers' safety. Before he could ensure this, Shankar is accidentally killed in a work-related accident, leaving behind his wife, Parvati (Raakhee) and young son, Rakesh (Sanjay Dutt). Rakesh is in trauma because of this incident, and this trauma is repeated in his mind every time his mother comes near him. Parvati is instructed to keep away from Rakesh, and Rakesh is adopted by Robert (Amjad Khan) and his wife, Kathy (Aruna Irani) and they rename him Rocky.
Years later, Rocky has grown up without knowing who his birth mother is. Rocky's lifestyle is carefree, until he falls in love with Renuka (Tina Munim). It is then that he learns that he is really Rakesh, and that his mother is still alive, and his father did not die accidentally, but was murdered. Rocky sets out to avenge his father's death. He gets help from a rape victim (Reena Roy). But he doesn't know that his days, along with those of his near and dear ones, may also be numbered.
