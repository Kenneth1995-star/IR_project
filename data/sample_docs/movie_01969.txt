Racing Luck

After the horse Life Belt is disqualified for a drug violation, trainer Dan Morgan is suspended from horse racing. He goes to work in a lesser role for June and Jimmy Curtis at their stables and tends to Color Sergeant, an injured horse.
A rival stable owner, Walker Hammond, is willing to go to any lengths to win. His men set fire to the Curtis stables, and when his horse Carnation scores a narrow victory over Color Sergeant in a big race, Morgan proves that Carnation is actually another horse, entered illegally. Hammond is now the one banned from the track.
