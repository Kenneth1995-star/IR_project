The Man Upstairs

Peter Watson, a tenant of an apartment block is troubled with pain and an inability to sleep. He repeatedly tries unsuccessfully to light the gas-fire that requires coins and seeks help from another lodger, artist Nicholas, who is spending the night with his model, and is reluctant to be disturbed. Another neighbour, Pollen calls for police help. The others in the boarding house are awake by this time, and Mrs. Barnes tries to help the mentally confused Watson but he also refuses her help. The police clash with Dr. Sanderson, a welfare worker, who thinks he can take the gun-toting Watson without complications, but when a police sergeant is injured, Police Inspector Thompson is determined to take Watson by force if necessary.
