Up with the Lark

During the Second World War, two incompetent female detectives, Ethel and Gracie (played by the British radio comedians Ethel Revnell and Gracie West), disguise themselves as Land Girls, with the aim of exposing the black market business that they believe a local hotel manager is running. Despite the two women's inept efforts, they eventually succeed.[2]
