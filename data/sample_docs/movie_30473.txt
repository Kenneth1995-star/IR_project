Tirupathi (Prabhu Deva), Pazhani (Raju Sundaram) and Chidambaram (Nagendra Prasad) are physically impaired â€” one cannot see, the second is hard of hearing and the third is mute. None has a family. They are friends who begin to live under the same roof. Narmada (Jyotika) enters their lives and all three fall in love with her. The story follows their attempts to win her hand.
