Dabangg 2

The story carries on from the previous film— Inspector Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan)— in charge of a local police station in Kanpur and resides there with his wife Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha), half brother Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan) and stepfather (Vinod Khanna). A boy gets kidnapped from a school therefore Chulbul deals with the problem. In Kanpur, an assassin murders a witness who is about to testify against a dreaded don. Chulbul tracks the assassin down, killing him at a coffeehouse. The don is Bachcha (Prakash Raj), a struggling politician. After several public altercations, Bachcha's brother Genda (Deepak Dobriyal) convinces him to get rid of Pandey, threatening Chulbul's stepfather to kill his entire family if Chulbul keeps on interfering in Bachcha's criminal activities.
Genda harasses a girl, arriving at her wedding to kidnap her. Chulbul arrives at the wedding and asks Genda to leave. Genda refuses to comply and continues to insult Chulbul. Chulbul breaks his neck, leading to his death. In the meantime his wife becomes pregnant, Pandey being advised by everybody to leave Bachcha alone for the sake of his family's safety. Bachcha, promising to avenge his brother's death, decides to do so before the election. He meets Rajjo and Makkhi while they are leaving a temple where Makkhi is shot by Bachcha and Rajjo is pushed off the temple stairs. However both of them survive with Rajjo having a miscarriage and suffering a head injury.
Chulbul is enraged at the loss of his first child. He enters Bachcha's location and kills all of his men. He tries to arrest Bachcha, but when Bachcha tries to tease him, he kills him instantly by grabbing a gun and shooting him with 2 bullets in the chest. Later, Chulbul and Rajjo have their first child, a baby boy. Right at the end, Chedi Singh's photographer (from the first film, Dabangg) arrives asking for a family photo. They all laugh and the photographer takes the picture.
