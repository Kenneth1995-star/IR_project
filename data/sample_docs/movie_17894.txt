 Patrick

Kathy (Sharni Vinson) is a young nurse that is eager to prove herself in her new job in an isolated psychiatric clinic. She's intrigued by Patrick (Jackson Gallagher), a comatose patient that her boss Dr. Roget (Charles Dance) assures her is incapable of truly responding to any external stimuli. Kathy is horrified by the experiments that Roget and his nurse Matron Cassidy (Rachel Griffiths) inflict upon him, and she's initially pleased when she finds a way to communicate with him. This quickly turns to horror when Patrick uses his psychic abilities to interfere with her life outside of the hospital, as Patrick has grown obsessed with Kathy and will harm anyone that he deems to be interfering with his relationship with her.
