Triangle

Ji-young is a beautiful widow of an extremely wealthy family who finds herself attracted to Sang-woo, whom she meets at a ski resort. Sang-woo is the CEO of a company that arranges art exhibitions, and Ji-young finds him different from the gold diggers who usually come on to her. She starts opening up to him, because he is gentle-natured and seems to be rich enough not to want her for her money. But actually, Sang-woo is a con artist who only has ₩4,000 left to his name. He approached her because he has his eye on an art piece called "Galatea's Tears" which is priced at over ₩2 billion. His attempts are thwarted each time by a woman named Sung-hye who always appears right before he is about to make a crucial move. She claims to be Ji-young's batchmate from high school, but Ji-young doesn't remember her at all. Sang-woo is suspicious of Sung-hye and follows her, only to have his cover blown. Sung-hye had, in fact, been targeting Sang-woo. He panics but is surprised when she proposes that he let her in on his scam to steal "Galatea's Tears."
