Nilaave Vaa

Siluvai (Vijay) is the son of Cruz (Vinu Chakravarthy). They are Christians living in a fishing village. In another town, Perumaal (Jaiganesh) is the father to Sangeetha (Suvalakshmi) and Gauri. Sangheeta comes to the small fishing village. Raghuvaran is proposed (and later engaged) to marry her. However, Gauri, falls in love with Raghuvaran's friend and after hearing that their father Jaiganesh doesn't want to accept the Hindu-Christian marriage, she decides to elope with her lover. This leads to the breakup of Sangeetha and Siluvai's love affair. However Raghuvaran, upon hearing Siluvai's story, gives a great speech to the villagers and unites Siluvai and Sangeetha.
