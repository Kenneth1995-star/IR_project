She also has to raise and care for his 6-year-old daughter Shiayou (Cheung Ching-yu). Feng's wife had taken the entire family savings and left them when she found out he was diagnose with his illness. Ran must take in work as a seamstress at home to make a living and make ends meet. She cares for her brother and niece by day and works throughout the night to rush her work deadline. She doesn't have an easy life so she always has a depressive and sad expression on her face. To make matters worst Ran is afraid one day she or Shiayou will end up like her brother since his illness is hereditary.
One day Shiayou meets small-time cat burglar Juchin (Dylan Kuo), when she sneaks out of the house to have a fun day in the city and gets lost. He brings her back home and gets to know the family. From that day on he visits them frequently and takes care of Feng and Shiayou. He eventually rents the unit above Ran's unit to store his stolen goods. Ran soon develops gratitude for Juchin, because some of her daily burdens have been lifted from her. Love soon develops between her and Juchin as they get to know each other better.
Juchin continues his daily life as a burglar in order to finance Shiayou's future studies at a music academy. However, he also gets tangled up with local triad boss Fu (Samuel Pang) who wants him to join his gang. Juchin has no interest joining Fu's gang or becoming a triad member. For this Fu makes trouble for Juchin as anyone who refuses to cooperate with Fu becomes his enemy. [1][2]
