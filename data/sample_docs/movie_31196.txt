Pandianadu

Sivakumar (Vishal), a meek person who owns a mobile sales and service center in Madurai, falls for a schoolteacher Malar (Lakshmi Menon). His father Kalyanasundaram (Bharathiraja), a retired government employee, shows much care on Sivakumar's elder brother Nagaraj (Guru Somasundaram). Meanwhile, there is a big mafia gang led by Simmakkal Ravi (Sharath Lohitashwa), who rules Madurai with an iron fist. Sethu (Vikranth), a friend of Siva, helps him woo Malar. Sethu helps his ex-lover Amudha (Krithi Shetty) escape from Ravi's chief henchman, Bharani (Harish Uthaman). Nagaraj, an honest government officer, gets into Ravi's bad books and is killed by Ravi. Siva learns that Sethu is also killed by Ravi and is infuriated. Now, the helpless father and the meek son draw up separate plans to eliminate Ravi. Kalyanasundaram hires a hit-squad to do his bidding while Sivakumar monitors Ravi's activities closely, biding his time for the right moment. The hit squad makes a failed attempt at Ravi and he in turn tracks the source down to an 'old man' (Kalyanasundaram). Just as Kalyanasundaram is about to be 'found out' in a trap set by Ravi, Sivakumar interferes and manages to secure his father out without his knowledge. Sivakumar continues to be on Ravi's heels but he too gets exposed and the story culminates with Sivakumar mustering up all his courage strength out of his survival instinct and kills all of Ravi's associates and Ravi himself. Sivakumar also manages to retrieve the cash his father had paid to the hit-squad, and this lets Kalyanasundaram know that Sivakumar was the one responsible for Ravi's death.
