We Joined the Navy

Lieutenant Commander Robert Badger in an excellent naval officer with one major problem. He speaks the truth at the most inopportune times that lead him to being transferred from ship, to shore, and then to instruct at Royal Naval College. When his remarks are repeated by one of his students to his father, an anti-military Member of Parliament he has one last chance. He and three problem Midshipmen are sent as exchange officers to the flagship of the United States Sixth Fleet. Their antics set back Anglo-American relations until they go ashore to a nation in a midst of a revolution.
