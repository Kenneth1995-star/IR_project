Avengers of the Reef

Scientists Bill Stewart goes to Fiji with his son Tim to investigate the appearance of the Crown of Thorns starfish in the reefs off the island. It turns out a mining syndicate set up by Updike is deliberately seeding the reefs with the star fish to enable them to mine the reef area. Updike hires an assassin, Kemp, to kill Stewart. He fails but Tim thinks he has succeeded and runs away to an island village pursued by Kemp. Tim makes friends with a Fijian boy Sai and is eventually reunited with his father.
