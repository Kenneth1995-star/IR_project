God of War

In 1557, Japanese samurai warriors involved in wokou piracy terrorized and took control of the coastline villages in China. The Chinese General Yu Dayou (Sammo Hung) with the help of General Qi Jiguang (Vincent Zhao) had to create strategic methods and weapons to defeat the pirates.[citation needed] To prepare for battle against the ruthless pirates, General Qi convinces his leader to allow him to train a new army. General Qi then recruits and trains some brave villagers to become his new army.
