Police Woman

Chien Chen, a Hong Kong taxi driver, picks up Ho Mei Fong, a woman on the run from a gang of criminals. She dies suddenly and mysteriously in his back seat, but not before hiding her purse in the taxi. Now, the gang members begin to torment Chen, hoping he will hand over the purse, despite Chen being completely unaware of it.
Chen is visited by a woman claiming to Ho Mei Fong's sister and looking for the purse. Days later, the dead woman's real sister, Police Inspector Ho Wai Ma, visits Chen and reveals that she had not spoken to her sister in years as she had become involved in the criminal underworld. The pair decide to team up to find Ho Mei's killers and bring them to justice.
The impostor turns out to be Sao Mei, who also works for the gang's evil boss. Chen witnesses her being kidnapped by the thugs and follows them to their hideout, joined by Ho Wai Ma. However both heroes are captured by the villains. Locked in a room together, Sao Mei reveals the truth to Ho Wai. The boss recruits attractive young women, such as Sao Mei and Ho Mei Fong, to become drug smugglers for him. However Ho Mei became desperate to escape and took photos of the mole faced gang leader planting a car bomb which subsequently killed a man. The gangsters become aware of this and force her to drink poison. Secretly assisted by Sao Mei, Ho Mei escapes the hideout with the incriminating evidence hidden in her purse. Tragically she did not make it to the hospital in time, and died in Chen's taxi.
Chen, Ho Wai and Sao Mei manage to escape from their holdings and fight off their captors, then summon both the police and Chen's fellow taxi drivers to their location. The criminals try to escape, but in a final brawl Chen defeats the gang leader and retrieves Ho Mei's purse from his taxi. The evidence and the villains are then handed over to the police.
