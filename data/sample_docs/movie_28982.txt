Geetha Gandhi

Subbaiyer is an old man whose grand-daughter is studying in Annamalai University. She comes home by train. At Egmore railway station an unknown woman hands over an infant child asking the girl to hold it for a moment. While the girl is holding the baby, its mother jumps in front of a train and commits suicide. Shocked by this, the girl approaches the police. But they taunt her. She goes home with the baby and there also she is treated in the same manner. In the meantime, two men travel in a train. One is a doctor and the other is a person who is intent on carrying out a revenge. The latter takes the identity of the doctor and sends the real doctor to a mental asylum. The fake doctor "invents" a medicine and becomes rich. A nurse falls in love with him. The girl who was chased out of the house enters the mental asylum after the abandoned baby dies. The old man, Subbaiyer, is saddened by the turn of events and takes it upon himself to bring back happiness in the family. What he does, forms the rest of the story.[3]
