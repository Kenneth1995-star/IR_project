Her Husband's Friend

As described in a film magazine,[4] Princeton Hadley (Chatterton), because of favors done during his college days by Billy Westover (Lee), feels a moral obligation upon Billy's sudden death in an automobile accident to hold to the responsibility of paying the widow's alimony to Judith (Bennett) as her husband's bondsman, even though the law does not require this. Shortly before his death, Billy had been divorced from his wife and had lost his fortune. Later, Princeton meets the widow without knowing her identity and falls in love with her. Judith is revealed when the two are brought before their lawyer, and Princeton convinces her that he wishes to continue his obligation as her husband.
