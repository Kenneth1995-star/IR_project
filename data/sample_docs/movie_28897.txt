K. S. Mani

The story is based on a 1933 Hollywood film Roman Scandals. In the film, N. S. Krishnan used to give musical discourses on the story of King Vikramaditya, a legendary emperor of ancient India. NSK takes the emperor as his role model. One day he had a dispute with his friend M. R. Swaminathan who knocks NSK unconscious. During the unconscious state, NSK becomes the Emperor Vikramaditya. In this dream-like state he undergoes many adventures along with T. S. Durairaj. As a king he travels faster using roller skates. He meets Pesa Madanthai (woman who doesn't speaks) T. A. Mathuram and falls in love with her and sets about to make her his own.[3]
