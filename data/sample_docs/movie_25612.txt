Pita

In disagreement with her husband on how her daughter should be raised and what she should become, the central character of a woman thinks that if she declares her husband insane she would be able to decide for her daughter. Acting on this she sows seeds of confusion in the mind of his husband that he might not be the father of their daughter. The husband starts to believe and actually goes insane and his wife gets the custody of their daughter.[3]
