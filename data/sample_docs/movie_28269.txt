Padmasree Bharat Dr. Saroj Kumar (പത്മശ്രീ ഭരത് ഡോക്ടർ സരോജ് കുമാർ)

Saroj Kumar is a matinée idol and megastar in Kerala churning out hits one after the other. But a few of his recent movies, such as Vekkeda Vedi, turns out to be big flops. His new film, directed by Alex Samuel, gets cancelled on the first day of shooting when Saroj slaps fellow actor Shyam for some silly reasons. Pachalam Bhasi, the producer, tries for a compromise, but Saroj is not ready to apologise.
Alex Samuel and Pachalam Bhasi starts their new film with Shyam in the lead. Saroj bribes film associations and gets it banned. He gets the rank of Colonel in the Army and shows of with it. This is when Babykuttan, another producer, comes into scene. He helps Alex Samuel and Pachalam Bhasi to resume their project. Saroj Kumar tries to cancel the film in many ways but it is successfully completed and is well received by the audiences.
Meanwhile, the income tax department raids his premises and starts prosecution proceedings for tax evasion. Saroj is tense about this, and he drinks a lot acting in a different manner. Many truths regarding Saroj's personal life are revealed towards the end. The film ends a silhouette showing the film's timeline (and Saroj's failure) and Alex Samuel, along with Shyam celebrating the success of the film.
