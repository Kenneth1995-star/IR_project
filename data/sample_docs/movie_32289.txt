Lakshmi Kalyanam

Two feuding villages form the backdrop of this story, with Ramu (Kalyan Ram) and Lakshmi (Kajal Aggarwal) belonging to one village and villain Giridhar (Ajay) to another. Lakshmi and Ramu are cousins, who grow up to love each other, which is not appreciated by Lakshmi's father, who is also the village head.
Meanwhile, Giridhar's evil eye falls upon Lakshmi when he chances upon her in college. He writes on her back in blood that he would marry her. This enrages Ramu who thrashes Giridhar only to be taunted to prove his love towards Lakshmi by opening the doors of the temple, which is the bone of contention between the two villages.
