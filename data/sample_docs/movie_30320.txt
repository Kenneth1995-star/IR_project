Anthapuram

Bhanu (Soundarya) is a carefree young woman who lives happily with her guardian (Babu Mohan) in Mauritius. She is introduced to Prakash (Sai Kumar) and they get married quite spontaneously, and are soon expecting a child. One day, prakash comes to know that his family is in trouble, back in India. Bhanu is confused as she believed that he was an orphan, but prakash explains to her that his family belongs to an extremely feudal society, and unable to bear the faction and violence in the community, he migrated to Mauritius. They decide to travel to India in order to assess the situation.
The couple arrive in prakash's hometown, where his father Narasimha (Prakash Raj) is an influential man with rustic habits, who doesn’t find Bhanu to be traditional enough for his son. Bhanu is uncomfortable with the casual approach to violence that she and her child see in the household. Narasimha’s wife Sharada is a kind hearted person who takes care of prakash, Bhanu and their son. She requests them to remain in India for a few more days in order to celebrate prakash's birthday, and during this time prakash is killed by Narasimha’s rivals. Bhanu is distraught and tries to take her son away from this madness and violence, but Narasimha stops her from doing so. He says prakash’s son must be raised in a traditional way in order to avenge his father’s death, and if needed Bhanu can leave the town by leaving her son behind. Bhanu refuses to allow this and, with the help of Narasimha’s family members, she escapes from the house with her son. Dubai Pandiyan (Jagapathi Babu), a party thief, helps Bhanu evade Narasimha's man in order to board a train Hyderabad. Dubai is killed in the midst of violence whilst trying to protect Bhanu and her son. Narashimha continues to pursue Bhanu but ultimately allows her and the child to leave, after emotionally interacting with his grandson.
