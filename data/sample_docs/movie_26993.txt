In Mumbai, an affable Indian Punjabi Hindu Bollywood buff and wanna-be-actor Suneet ("Sunny"), who works as an assistant director, fantasizes on becoming a heart-throb star. However, at every audition he is summarily thrown out. Undeterred, he goes with an American crew to remote areas in Rajasthan to work on a documentary.
One day, a terrorist, Muslim Jihadist group kidnaps him instead of an American crew-member. Sunny finds himself on enemy border amidst guns and pathani-clad guards, who decide to keep him hostage until they locate their original target. The house where he is confined belongs to a Pakistani Muslim, whose trade stems from pirated Hindi films, which he brings back every time he crosses the border. Soon, the two factions realize that they share a human and cultural bond. The film shows how cinema can be the universal panacea for co-existence.
