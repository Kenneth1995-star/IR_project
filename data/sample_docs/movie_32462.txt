Aha Naa Pellanta

Subrahmanyam (Allari Naresh) is an intelligent, hardworking software engineer. He lives with his uncle (Ahuti Prasad), keeps a poster of Bill Gates in his room, spends most of his time with his girlfriend Madhu (Anita Hassanandani), and his friend Busy Balraj (Brahmanandam). After getting drunk heavily one night, he wakes up with another girl, Sanjana (Ritu Barmecha). Neither he nor the girl remember how they got together, but they both start to believe that they had sex. Before long Sanjana's goon brothers (Srihari, Subbaraju, Samrat) warn him of dire consequences if he doesn't marry their innocent sister. No matter how hard he tries to escape the marriage, he can't evade the brothers. Just when he has given up all hope and agrees to the forced marriage, he stumbles upon a secret that turns the tables, and finds himself in a drama of love and revenge.[5]
