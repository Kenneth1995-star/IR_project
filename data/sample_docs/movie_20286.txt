Jabberwocky

Dennis Cooper is a young cooper apprentice living in poverty, working for his father and determined to marry Griselda Fishfinger. Dennis' father becomes terminally ill, and at his deathbed, his father speaks badly of Dennis. The young man resolves to make a pilgrimage into the city and find work before returning to Griselda. Griselda throws a potato at him, which he keeps as a cherished memento.
When Dennis arrives at the city, the people are in a sustained state of fear of a mysterious monster. The king, Bruno the Questionable, considers pitting the land's knights against each other in a jousting tournament to determine who will be sent to slay the monster. Upon returning, the knight will be promoted to prince and married to the Princess, who lives in a tower, wishing a true prince will arrive and marry her. The tournament is announced, while Dennis is told there is no work in the city for even the most skilled and famed cooper. When Dennis accidentally enters the tower, the beautiful and naked Princess mistakes him for her prince, assuming he was forced to don peasants' clothes in the midst of a perilous adventure. She has him disguised in a nun's habit and sent out, but the peasantry believe he is Satan in the guise of a nun, or a nun in the guise of Satan, and decide to send him to the monster.
Face to face with the monster, in the form of the bizarre Jabberwocky, Dennis accidentally kills the creature. Bruno the Questionable in turn promises to wed Dennis to the Princess.
