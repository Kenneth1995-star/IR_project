Daruvu

The film's story is similar to fantasy films like Yamaleela, Yamudiki Mogudu, Yamagola and Yamadonga.
Bullet Raja (Ravi Teja) is a small-time crook with a good heart. He bumps into Swetha (Taapsee Pannu) at a function and falls in love with her, but She is already engaged to Harbour Babu (Sushant Singh), a powerful local goon. One day, using Swetha's dance master Vidya Balan (Brahmanandam), Bullet Raja and Swetha manage to run away from Babu to reach a hilltop, but Babu tracks them down and is severely beaten by Bullet Raja. At the last moment, Babu uses his Scorpio car to hit Bullet Raja off the hill-top. Bullet Raja clings on to a branch growing on the hill, but slips off it and falls down, yet still manages to survive. Just then, Chitragupta (M. S. Narayana) changes the story and the car that was stuck on the edge of the hill falls down on top of Bullet Raja and as he was crushed, the Scorpio car blasts, thus killing him.
Bullet Raja heads to Yamalokam where he realizes that his life has unjustly been terminated by Chitragupta, and so he picks up a fight with Yamadharma Raja (Prabhu). A helpless Yamadharma Raja gives Bullet Raja three options. Either he could be a Chinese warrior who was to die 2 days later, a terrorist who also has the same life span, or greedy, evil and corrupt Home Minister Ravindra (also Ravi Teja), who decides to turn over a new leaf after he realizes the affection and support the public has for him, but he is killed by his associates Balram (Sayaji Shinde), Shantaram (Avinash), and Pavitrananda (Raghu Babu). Thus, Bullet Raja decides to enter Ravindra who seemed the most normal among them. After Bullet Raja enters into Ravinder's body, he confronts Ravindra's and his own enemies and fulfills the wishes of his mother Parvathamma (Jayasudha) and his followers.
