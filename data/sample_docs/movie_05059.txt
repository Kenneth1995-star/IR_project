The Blonde Bandit

Gloria Dell arrives in a western town looking for a man she's been corresponding with who has sent her an engagement ring, but learns he's a bigamist. A jeweler overpays Gloria for the ring, then lies that she robbed his store. The money's found on Gloria and she is placed under arrest.
A mobster, Joe Sapelli, suspects that Gloria has been framed and posts her bail. Before she leaves, a district attorney, Deveron, asks her to go undercover and expose Joe's rackets, in exchange for all charges against her being dropped. Corrupt vice-squad cops Metzger and Roberts tip off Joe, but he and Gloria surprisingly fall in love.
Deveron nabs the crooked cops and chases Joe to an air strip, where his private plane is unable to take off. Joe says goodbye to Gloria, but she promises to wait and gives him the ring.
