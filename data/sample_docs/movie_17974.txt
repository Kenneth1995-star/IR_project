Daruchini Dwip

A team of young boys and girls plan to have a big trip across Bangladesh. They all hail from the mega city of Dhaka. In Bangladesh, being a conservative country, it is not common to the sight of a group consisting of both young, single men and women traveling together. Yet in this story, the girls are seen to try to make it against the stream. Each had a different destination in mind: like Sundarban, Cox's Bazar, Saint Martin and many more places. Finally they decide to go to Daruchini Dip. 'Shuvro'(Riaz) has a big problem for his weak eyesight because he may be put out from the program. But finally the full team goes on a train with 'Shuvro'.
