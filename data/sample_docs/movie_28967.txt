Bhaktha Jana

Janaka (Santhakumari) has been a staunch devotee of Panduranga since her childhood days. Her mother does not approve of it as she feels such blind devotion will adversely affect her daughter's marriage prospects and her future. Frustrated by her mother's attitude, Jana leaves her home and is found by Panduranga (C. Honnappa Bhagavathar) in the guise of a hermit. He tells her to devote herself to Panduranga by worshipping him daily at his temple. Jana does do so accordingly, much to the discomfort and anger of another devotee, Panthoji (B. R. Panthulu). He doesn't like Janaka coming to the temple and offering worship to Panduranga and orders his disciples to throw her out. She is saved by Namadeva (Chittor V. Nagaiah) who provides her asylum in his home. One night, the jewellery in the temple goes missing and is found with Janaka. Panthoji and his disciples accuse Jana of thievery. When they open Panduranga's shrine, they are shocked to see that the idol is missing. The next moment, they see the idol along with the jewellery in her hands. Panthoji realises that she has the blessings of Panduranga and apologises to her for his accusations.[1]
