StreetDance 2

To beat the world's best dance crew at a dance-off in Paris, France, streetdancer Ash (Falk Hentschel) and new friend and manager, Eddie (George Sampson), gather the greatest streetdancers from around Europe, whilst hoping to add a Latin element courtesy of salsa dancer Eva (Sofia Boutella). After a rough start, the group all agree to incorporate this element and have fun adding Latin to street dance; whilst doing this, Ash and Eva grow closer. Two days before the big dance-off, Ash rejects Eva on the dance floor and refers to their fusion dance as a "Little Latin Experiment" when they're up against "The Surge" (Flawless) in a friendly dance-off. The police come and break up the dance-off and Eva runs away. Ash chases her but she doesn't want to know. The next day Ash goes to apologise to Eva but meets her Uncle ((Tom Conti)) who tells Ash to leave. Ash comes back to explain when he finds Eva's Uncle on the floor. He is rushed to the hospital where Eva meets him and Ash. When Eva's Uncle wakes up, he tells Ash that he should go to the dance-off. Ash and his crew leave for the dance-off and are frustrated to find the gates locked. Ash gets them in wearing popcorn sellers' clothes. They battle Invincible until the last dance where they need Eva. She appears and does the dance as planned. Ash and his crew finish, and are estatic to find they have won. Invincible's leader then hands the trophy to Ash. As everyone celebrates, Ash and Eva share a kiss.
