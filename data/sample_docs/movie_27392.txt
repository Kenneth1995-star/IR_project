Deadly-2

Soma (Audithya) is a talented cricketer-turned-underworld don. An incident where Soma is asked to cough up a 10 lakh bribe so as to be included in the state cricket team turns his life upside down.
Not only does the selector leave out Soma's name from the final list, but also refuses to return the money. What ticks off Soma even more is a swear word uttered by the selector. In an impulsive act of rage, Soma kills the selector and thus begins his tryst with the Bangalore crime scene.
Soma having emerged as one of the most wanted criminals, is on the hit list of police officers Ashok, Mani and Ugrappa. Does he fall to their bullets? And is there any connection between him and the Soma in Deadly Soma?
