Malice in Wonderland

A modern take on the famous fairy tale by Carroll, it is about a university student (Maggie Grace) who is knocked over by a black cab in Central London. When she wakes up, she has amnesia, lost in a world that is a long way from homeâ€”Wonderland. She is dragged through a surreal, frightening underworld filled with bizarre individuals and low-lifes, by the cab driver, Whitey (Danny Dyer). Confused, she tries to find out who she is, where she is from, and use what wits she has left to get back home.
