Raani Samyuktha

Prithvirajan (MGR) falls in love when he sees a portrait of princess Samyuktha (Padmini). To insult him, her father Jayachandran (MG Chakrapani) installs his statue at the entrance to the palace hall where the â€˜swayamvara' (a ceremony to choose the bridegroom) by the princess is to take place. Getting wind of it, Prithvirajan rushes to the spot on a horse and carries away his sweetheart, while others present watch shocked and stunned.
