Troublesome Night 9

Ms Liu, a compulsive gambler, meets Bud Pit on a cruise ship. When he tries to help her win, his girlfriend, Moon, becomes unhappy because Ms Liu has been neglecting her dying grandmother. Later, she visits Bud Pit's mother, the expert ghostbuster Mrs Bud Lung. When she asks Mrs Bud Lung to bless her so that she will win every time she gambles, Mrs Bud Lung tells her to clean up her parents' graves instead. She removes the weeds from her parents' graves and puts the rubbish on nearby graves. The angry spirits of the dead come to haunt her.
