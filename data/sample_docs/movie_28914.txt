Sabapathy

The film tells the story of a happy-go-lucky young man Sabapathy and his man servant (also named as Sabapathy). Sabapathy, son of a rich socialite and politician, Rao Sahib Manikka Mudaliar, neglects his studies and repeatedly fails his high school examinations. To make matters worse, his marriage is arranged with Sivakamu, daughter of a friend of his mother, Thribura Ammal. While Sabapathy's father initially rebukes Sivakamu for distracting Sabapathy from his studies and Thribura Ammal for her decision to marry off Sabapathy before completing his high school studies, he relents when he finds that Sivakami was actually assisting Sabapathy in his preparation for the examinations. The film ends with Sabapathy eventually clearing his high school examinations with the help of his wife.
