Kannamma En Kadhali

This film was inspired by the well-known French play, "School for Wives" by the celebrated 17th Century French playwright Moliere.
The movie narrated the tale of a rich, lecherous old man, (Narayana Rao at his best), who finds a young girl lost in a temple festival crowd and brings her up with the intention of marrying her later. Without his knowledge, the young woman (Sundhari Bai) falls in love with a young man (Radha) and the two play smart games fooling the stuffy old man!
Kannamma En Kaathali was a melodrama with familiar twists but writer-director Kothamangalam Subbu invested the film with a light touch almost ‘Wodehouseian’. Times were harsh and people needed entertainment. This film was fulfilled their need.[2]
