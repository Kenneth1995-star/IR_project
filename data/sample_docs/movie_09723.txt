The Kidnapping of the President

During a diplomatic visit to Toronto, President Adam Scott (Hal Holbrook) was warned by Secret Service Agent Shatner (Jerry O'Connor) about a potential life threat. Ignoring his warning, the President is abducted by South American terrorist, Roberto Assanti (Miguel Fernandes), along with his female accomplice, for political pursuits and personal profits.
While held captive in an armored truck booby-trap with high explosives, ineffective bribes occurred due to the Secret Service unable to meet the terrorists' high demands - $100 million worth in diamonds along with two airplanes by the midnight deadline. With the explosives timed to detonate at midnight, Agent Shatner has to find a way into the truck to rescue the President, Vice President Ethan Richards (Van Johnson), and the Vice President's wife Beth (Ava Gardner) before it detonates.
Agent Shatner eventually gets one of Assanti's terrorist group members to turn on Assanti, which caused Assanti's sister to die. Agent Shatner learns Assanti's plan for the President and develops a plan for his own to help save the President - go through the engine and firewall with a cutting torch.[1]
