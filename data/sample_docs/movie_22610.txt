Driverless

Driverless is about three love stories that are intertwined by a car accident.
It deals with several relationship issues: the seven year itch, reuniting with a first love, one night stands, Mayâ€“December romances, and extramarital affairs.
The director hoped to present love stories set in our current "materialistic era", and force audiences to consider what the standard is to measure love. "Should we be loyal to money, material things or our own hearts?"[3]
