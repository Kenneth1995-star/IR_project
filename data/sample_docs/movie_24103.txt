Maach Mishti & More

The film looks at a Bengali joint family of Kolkata in the present time. The grandfather (Soumitra Chatterjee) is modern, mingles freely with youngsters and wears hip clothes. The parents (Anuradha Roy and Pradip Mukherjee) are comparatively conventional but generally do not interfere in their kids' lives. The oldest, Rahul (Souvik Kundagrami), a successful NRI, returns to base with his wife (Swastika Mukherjee) with plans of opening a restaurant of American food. The second son, Ronnie (Parambrato), is a corporate honcho going steady with a rich Marwari girl called Swati (Rachita Chauhan) but is not sure about whether he really is in love with her or whether the slightly crazy Ishaani (Raima Sen) fascinates him more. The youngest, Raj (Anubrata), is a wannabe filmmaker with a mind of his own and his pockets filled with money doled out by the elders. The film closes with Rahul and his wife going back to the US to open a Bengali restaurant called Maach Misti & More.
