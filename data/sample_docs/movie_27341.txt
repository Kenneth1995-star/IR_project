Geleya

Guru (Prajwal) and Vishwa (Tarun) are the best friends from the same village. They migrate to Bangalore city in search of a job and better living. Out of greed to make quick money, they join the anti-social gang who are threatening the common lives of Bangalore. Coincidently, Guru and Vishwa join the two rival gangs who are constantly against each other. In due course, Guru kills Vishwa's boss and this enrages Vishwa who sets vengeance against Guru's boss. Vishwa becomes the leader of the gang and kills Guru's boss eventually. This leads to a massive clash between the two groups and Vishwa's wife (Kirat) tries to match up between the old friends but to no avail. A tough cop (Duniya Vijay) gets deployed to handle the case and what happens next forms the crux of the story.
