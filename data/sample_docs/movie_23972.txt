Shunya E Buke

Saumitra (Kaushik Sen), a brilliant artist (Painter and sculptor), visits Khajuraho to draw inspiration and meets Churni (Churni Ganguly) there through a common friend (Tota) who is an artiste too. Love blossoms between them in Kolkata and though their family and economic standards are poles apart, they decide to marry. Churni breaks away from her rich, blue blood family. On the marriage night Kaushik, to his shock, discovers that Churni is flat-chested. The shock develops into sense of being cheated, anger and finally hatred. Teesta goes and seeks solution from Sharmisthadi (Rupa Ganguly) her boss. When Soumitro turns up there he is turned away. Soumitra draws a diagram one day and shows the shortcoming of Teesta's body to Joydeep (Kharaj Mukherjee) who in turns tells it to Sujoy, Sujoy to Anjit. Teesta comes to know about this from Anjit. She asks Soumitro not to make a mockery of her any more and asks for a divorce. A few years later Soumitro again comes across Anjit and Teesta with their daughter at the back. Anijit and Teesta stayed in touch and found solace in each other and got married. Teesta tells Soumitro that her husband is quite happy with her as well as her daughter in spite of her physical shortcoming and they have a very happy married life. Soumitra regrets the offences that he had committed a few years back and he questions himself with a heart full of guilt and shame.
