His elder brother Balu (Nizhalgal Ravi) falls in love with his friend Maala (Ramya Krishnan), a modern woman, and he discloses it to Somu. They finally get married. Thereafter, the entire family searches a bride for Somu. In turn, Somu gets married with Sumathi (Sukanya) who is from a conservative strict family. Sumathi becomes a suspicious wife and she finds irritating her husband family's behaviours. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
