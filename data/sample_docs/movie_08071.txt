Chamber of Horrors

Danova and Hyde-White are proprietors of a wax museum in Baltimore who are also amateur sleuths. They are drawn into the investigation of Jason Cravette (O'Neal), an insane murderer who kills a woman and then "marries' her. They help the police capture him, but he escapes and vows vengeance on all who "betrayed" him.
The film used the gimmicks of the Fear Flasher and the Horror Horn to alert viewers to grisly moments.[1] The film was released theatrically because it was too intense for television.[2] The gimmicks were added (along with a few star cameos like Tony Curtis, Suzy Parker, and Marie Windsor) to increase the running time. There are plot similarities between this and Dark Intruder, which was released the previous year.
The film is narrated by William Conrad.
