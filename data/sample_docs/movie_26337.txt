Kishen (Anil Kapoor),a wealthy newspaper editor, has a suspicious-minded wife, Kaajal (Lara Dutta), who thinks he is always having an affair with another woman, even though he is extremely faithful to her and wouldn't dream of betraying her in any way. Prem (Salman Khan),Kishen's friend who is also a wealthy businessman, has the opposite situation. He is married to Pooja (Esha Deol), who is very trusting, even though he has been having several affairs with numerous gorgeous women. There is Kishen's employee Shekhar (Fardeen Khan), whom Kishen treats as his younger brother, who accidentally falls in love with Sanjana (Celina Jaitley). Sanjana hates lies and doesn't tolerate other woman in a man's life. Then Bobby (Bipasha Basu), a call girl, enters the story. When Kishen takes pictures of Prem and his girlfriend, and threatens to send them to his wife, Prem hires Bobby to seduce Kishen. The plan is that Kishen will fall in Prem's trap, and Prem wants to see if Kishen can hide the relationship from his wife. Kishen plans to meet Bobby at his home while his wife has gone to Ajmer. Though she forgetting her passport at home,returns back,only to find Bobby with Kishen in their out-house,which they had given Shekhar to live in. Then the lies start happening, as Kishen to hide his mistake from Kaajal tells her that Bobby is Shekhar's wife, and Sanjana, whose marriage is being fixed with Shekhar, thinks Bobby is Kishen's wife. Prem in order to save his friends' marriages tells Sanjana and Kaajal that Bobby is his second wife. It becomes a bundle of confusion, arguments and comedy when all the various couples meet together. The truth is eventually told through many comedic encounters, and eventually the three friends seemingly turn over a new leaf. It is hinted at the end of the movie, however, that the three friends have not completely turned over a new leaf with the entrance of Sameera Reddy in a cameo.
