The Jammed

The film begins with an interrogation in an immigration office, revealing an illegal immigrant working as a prostitute on the verge of being deported. Throughout the film it becomes apparent that one of the interrogators (Damien Richardson) has in fact had sex with the girl at an illegal brothel, negating his encouragement to her to tell the truth.
The film then back tracks three weeks as Ashley (Veronica Sywack), a bored, single insurance clerk who unwittingly becomes involved when she meets a Chinese woman, Sunee (Amanda Ma), as a blind-date airport pick up goes wrong. We learn that Sunee is searching for her daughter, Rubi. Through the various flash backs we meet Crystal (Emma Lung), Vanya (Saskia Burmeister) and Rubi (Sun Park) who have all been enslaved in a Melbourne brothel on premise of "working off their debt" of being brought to Australia with false papers and forced to work as prostitutes.
