Always Be My Maybe

Jake del Mundo (Gerald Anderson) is a handsome boy who comes from a privileged background. After years of being a carefree bachelor, he thinks he is now ready to settle down. On the night that he proposes to his long-time girlfriend, Tracy, she finally had enough of Jake and dumped him for another man. At the same time, Kristina "Tintin" Paraiso (Arci Muñoz) a make-up artist, idealistically dreams of a near "perfect" relationship and believes that the guy she's going out with is about to ask her to marry him. Fate turns differently when the guy didn't arrive to meet her in the restaurant and finds out on Facebook that he has already committed himself to another girl. After knowing the truth, she shares her heartbreak on social media in a video that immediately went viral.
After six months of recovering from their failed relationships, the two found themselves in a beach resort that Jake owns. Coincidentally, Tintin was there to work on an out of town job as a make up artist with her co make-up artists Esang (Cacai Bautista), Ms. Andrè (Ricci Chan) and some friends. When the two crossed paths, they end up spending one entire night drinking and talking about their personal lives until dawn. Before they part, they exchanged numbers and agreed to meet in Manila.
Hopeless romantic Jake gets intrigued by the jaded and outspoken Tintin. After discovering they are stuck on the same situation, the two end up spending more and more time together bringing the best out of each other. On a night out at a bar, they both agreed to be each other’s confidant to help find someone better than their exes. What happens next is a realistic and simple love story that almost everyone can relate to.
