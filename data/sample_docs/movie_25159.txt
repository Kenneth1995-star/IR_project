Khoon Aur Paani

Singh (P. Jairaj) is a farmer and lives a poor lifestyle along with his wife and two sons, Ram and Lakshman. The region is drought-stricken, while in contrast, there is plenty of water being pumped to bathe the dogs of Thakur Vikram Singh (Ajit). When Ram decides to divert some water for their parched fields, Vikram Singh kills his father. An enraged Ram goes to avenge his death, manages to kill Vikram's brother Badi Thakur, but is seriously injured, loses his memory and ends up with a gang of bandits and is renamed Thanedar Singh, as he was dressed in the clothes of a police inspector. Lakshman also gets separated from his mother and is found near a river bank by Police Commissioner Bhalla (Om Shivpuri), who adopts him. Years later, the two brothers are fated to meet again, albeit, as strangers and mortal enemies, Ram (Feroz Khan) is dreaded bandit Thanedar Singh a dacoit, who is unable to recall his childhood, and loses control whenever he hears the sound of a water-pump and Lakshman (Jeetendra) is an incognito CBI Officer Rakesh. The remaining story shows how two brothers unite with their mother.
