Kotayya (Perumallu) is an honest poor farmer who has a son Venu (Nageshwara Rao) and daughter Bharathi (Ammaji). Sagarayya (C.S.R) is the landlord in the village who gives loans for high interest and when the farmers fail to pay he grabs their lands. With the help Karanam Sambayya (Ramana Reddy) and Rowdy Polayya (Relangi) Sagarayya grabs the lands in the false names. Retired military man Ratnam (Seetaram) and his daughter Radha (Janaki) also lives in the same village. After an initial misunderstanding with Venu, Radha falls in love with him and marries him. Venu tells all about Sagarayya in front of the collector and distributes the land to the real owners. How Sagarayya creates differences between Kotayya and Venu, and how Venu solves his problems and arrange his sister's marriage with Gopalam (Vallam Narasimha Rao) and sends Sagarayya and his men to jail is the rest of the story.
