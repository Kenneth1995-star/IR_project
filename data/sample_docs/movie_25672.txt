Drohi

Crime Branch Inspector Krishna (Salim Ghouse) has been assigned the task of apprehending Raghav (Nagarjuna Akkineni), a notorious Hitman for the mafia leader J.P. Sethi (Danny Denzongpa), which he accepts. The Mayor (Akash Khurana) has taken a special interest in this case, and has issued instructions to Krishna, authorizing him to deal with the matter of Shankar Narayana vs. Sethi criminal nexus. A few days later, the Mayor is assassinated. When pressure mounts on J.P. Sethi to turn in Raghav, he instead pays another man to confess for the assassination, thus leading to the closure of this file. But Krishna is not convinced, and is sure that Raghav is behind the Mayor's assassination. Krishna has a sister, Bhavana (Urmila Matondkar), an ornithologist, who is in love with Shekhar. When Krishna finds out about this, he asks Bhavana to stop seeing Shekhar, as Shekhar is another alias for the cold-hearted killer Raghav.
