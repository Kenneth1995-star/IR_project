Paarthale Paravasam

Madhava (Madhavan) is a doctor, and a single appearance as hero in a film has made him the heartthrob of thousands of girls. He marries Simi (Simran), but a revelation about his past separates them and takes them as far as divorce. They remain friends though, even going so far as to fix up each other's second marriages.
Simi decides to get Madhava married to Chella (Sneha), a nurse at his hospital, while he tries to fix up her marriage with a dancer, Azhagu (Lawrence Raghavendra). In the end, Madhava and Chella's wedding and Simi and Azhagu's wedding are on the same date. Unfortunately, Azhagu then marries his cousin due to his father's greed for wealth. Chella's parents find out about Madhava's past and call off the wedding. In the end Madhava and Simi remarry. Chella marries Kumaran (Vivek), Madhava's colleague, who was interested in her ever since he became Madhava's understudy in the hospital.
