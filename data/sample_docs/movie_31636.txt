During 1920, the time of British Raj in Madras State a train accident estranges freedom fighter couple Santhamma (G. Varalakshmi) and husband Dharmarao (K.V.S. Sarma). However, Santhamma survives and brings up her son Sathyadev (Jaggaiah) and adopts another son Arjun (Master Suresh) and inculcates in them the Gandhiji’s principles. Arjun participates in the 1930 Salt Satyagraha kills a British Officer, and flies the Indian tricolor flag. On the other hand, DSP Sankara Rao (Gummadi) the brother of Santhamma, working under British administration summons Santhamma for the act and her son Arjun is imprisoned.
However with the help of Sankara Rao's daughter Sarala (Jamuna) and her follower Vinayak (Ramana Reddy) Sathyadev rescues Arjun from a hospital where he is being treated. Dharmarao brings the grievously injured Sathyadev and Arjun home. However his second wife’s son Suresh (Kantharao) drives them to the Sankara Rao's house instead of the doctor’s home. Sarala manages to free them from the home. Having identified themselves as Vigilante's to Rao's wife, Sathyadev and Arjun take shelter at Rao's house without his knowledge, Rao's wife Parvathi (Hemalatha) realizes that Arjun is their lost child. When an unnerved Rao and a British official tries to take them into custody, Sathyadev and Arjun kills the corrupt British officer and escape. In the ensuing chase and shootout, Santhamma who comes in between succumbs to bullet injuries and dies. A repentant Rao resigns his job opposing the British raj's atrocities towards Indians and protests, with India attaining independence, Sathyadev and Arjun are released from the prison.
