Elder brother Rajendran (M. G. Ramachandran, the good-hearted breadwinner of the family, watches over his young brother, Selvam (P. V. Narasimha Bharathi), a student, his younger sister Meena (E. V. Saroja) and their very ill mother, Gunavathi (S. R. Janaki). Karunagaran Pillai (M. G. Chakrapani), their paternal uncle, robs them of their fortune after the disappearance of the patriarch, and refuses all requests for financial help by Rajendran. On the other hand, Suriyamoorthy (P. S. Govindan), Karunagaran's son, discreetly devotes himself to his cousin, Rajendran, and his family. One evening, during a violent thunderstorm, young Meena loses her eyesight. She then becomes the scapegoat of Selvam's wealthy wife, Rajam (Madhuri Devi), her sister-in-law, who also begins hating Meena. Rajendran, previously unaware of the situation, finally discovers his younger sister's ordeal. Following a heated quarrel, Selvam and Rajam leave the family home, leaving Rajendran totally distraught. Then sadly, their mother dies and, expelled by their uncle, Rajendran and Meena are forced out onto the street.
Their cousin, Suriyamoorthy, runs away from his father to the capital, where he becomes a rickshaw driver and offers temporary accommodation to Rajendran and Meena. Meanwhile younger brother, Selvam, becomes addicted to horse racing just like his father-in-law (R. B. Rao), driving his family into financial ruin and neglecting Rajam. After Rajendran manages to reconcile the couple, Rajam dies in a road accident. Karunagaran comes in search of his son, and he too is knocked down by a vehicle. Dying, he gives his permission for Suriyamoorthy to marry Mary (V. Susheela), a Christian. As for Rajendran, he is beaten and finally, pushed to his limits, carries his sister into the sea and they both disappear under the waves.
