Mehbooba

Singer Suraj (Rajesh Khanna) was presented with a veena (stringed musical instrument) by his fiancee. Thereafter, he often listens to a haunting song at nights and observes that its name was "Ratna". One day, while going for a stage show, he gets stuck in heavy rain in an unknown place and goes to stay in a small motel, where he meets a woman named Ratna. During the night, he observes that Ratna, singing the same song he often hears at night, is going to a distant mahal (grand house of olden times). He follows her reflexively and enters the abandoned mahal. He tries to call out for Ratna, but learns from old keeper of the mahal that Ratna died more than a hundred years ago and people feel that she still haunts that mahal.
Later, a portrait of Ratna makes him remember their previous life. In the previous life he was Prakash, chief singer of royal court. He was in love with Ratna, a beautiful and talented court dancer. They fell in love, but both had problems to marry as Prakash was already promised to Jamuna in his childhood and Ratna couldn't marry as she was to become a royal courtesan, At last, they decided to run away, but were killed on their way, promising each other that they would meet again.
Suraj, after coming to his senses, feels lonely and confused. Shortly thereafter, he meets a gypsy, Jhumri (also Malini), who looks exactly like Ratna. Soon he makes Jhumri remember her past life and her love for Prakash. This angers Rita Malhotra (Asha Sachdev), fiancee of Suraj and Appa (Prem Chopra), who wants to marry Jhumri. Appa steals the portrait, and sets the gypsies against Suraj, ensuring a fight between Suraj and gypsies. But Suraj and Jhumri manage to overcome all the obstacles and stay together in this life.
