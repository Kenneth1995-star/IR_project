Blackfellas

In Perth, Western Australia, Doug Dooligan (John Moore), a young Nyoongar man, is released from prison where he was incarcerated for assault. Outside he is picked up by his charismatic childhood friend Floyd "Pretty Boy" Davies (David Ngoombujarra)—who was partially responsible for Doug's incarceration—and taken to a remote Aboriginal community. He becomes attracted to local girl Polly (Jaylene Riley) and, upon learning that Floyd is still involved in criminal activities, decides to leave and visit his mother. Determined to stay out of trouble, Doug buys back his father's old property, Yetticup, which has traditional roots. Polly joins him at Yetticup and not soon after Doug's father reappears having escaped from prison. Doug narrowly escapes the police when his father is apprehended, who later dies in prison. Distraught, Doug meets Floyd and the two become friends again. When Doug tries to stop Floyd from committing a crime, Floyd sacrifices his own life so that Doug can escape and avoid arrest.
