Uma Sundari

Rajashekara (Chittor V. Nagaiah) is the king of Mahendrapura. He has a sister by name Uma Sundari (Sriranjani Jr.) whom he loves a lot. Queen Neelaveni (Kannamba) wants to marry Uma Sundari with her retarded brother Alankar Bhoopati (Relangi), but she refuses to marry him because she is already in love with Vijaya Rayulu (N. T. Rama Rao) king of Rayadurgam. Rajashekara happily performs their marriage when Neelaveni gets offended and wants to take revenge on Uma Sundari. After that Uma Sundari is blessed with seven children. Meanwhile, Rayadurgam is hit with severe drought. Vijaya Rayulu & Uma Sundari give entire royal treasure for the sake of people. Uma Sundari writes many letters to her brother for help but Neelaveni does not show them to the king. In spite Rajashekara trying to help her sister, Neelaveni does not allow and prevents him going to Rayadurgam. Rayadurgam people blame Uma Sundari that she is responsible for the famine. Uma Sundari cannot withstand these blames leaves for Mahendrapuram with children. At the same time, Rajashekara also starts for Rajadurgam. But they donâ€™t meet in the middle. Rajashekara reaches Rayadurgam and Vijayarayulu accuses him and leaves the palace out of frustration. At Mahendrapuram Neelaveni insults Uma Sundari and throws her out. Uma out of hunger and anguish drowns her children in a well. Rajashekara comes to know the facts and comes back to Mahendrapuram furiously and when he is about to kill Neelaveni she commits suicide. Vijaya Rayalu becomes mad and roams like a wanderer. Lord Shiva (Nagabhushanam) in a beggar form guides him, helps to reach his wife and gives back their children & Kingdom. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note.
