Black Narcissus

A group of Anglican nuns travel to a remote location in the Himalayas (the Palace of Mopu, near Darjeeling) to set up a school and hospital for the local people. However they find themselves increasingly seduced by the sensuality of their surroundings in a converted seraglio high up in the mountains and by the local British agent, Mr Dean (David Farrar). Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), the Sister Superior, is attempting to forget a failed romance at home in Ireland. Tensions mount as Dean's laid-back charm makes an impression on Clodagh, but also attracts the mentally unstable Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), who becomes pathologically jealous of Clodagh, resulting in a nervous breakdown and a violent climax. In a subplot, 'the Young General' (Sabu), heir to the throne of a princely state who has come to the convent for his education, becomes infatuated with Kanchi, a lower caste dancing girl (Jean Simmons).
While much of the film's dialogue is taken verbatim from the novel, the film does not follow the novel exactly. In particular, the film does not include Mr Dean's rejection of Sister Clodagh's design for the chapel in favour of his own design of an open-sided building without doors located at the top of the ridge above the Holy Man. Additionally, (the imminently departing) Sister Philippa is not replaced by Sister Adela, a stern nun who is horrified at the dereliction of duty by the original nuns.
