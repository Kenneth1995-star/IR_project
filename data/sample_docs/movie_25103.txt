Aanchal

It is the story of an Indian woman, as pure as Sita, who is tested by a series of family events and problems.[2][3] The story revolves around the relationship between Shambu (Rajesh) and his sister-in-law Shanti (Raakhee). People in the village start speculating whether Shambu is romantically involved with Shanti, and even Kishan starts doubting his brother's intentions. Tulsi who loves Shambu, too, starts thinking bad about Shambu.
