John and Julie

John (Gibson) and Julie (Dudley) are two children from Dorset who are eager to see the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in spite of the fact that their respective parents have no intention of going. When the two are left alone they decide to run off to London to see John's 'Uncle Ben' "because he knows the queen". Along their way, they encounter different quirky and eccentric people who help them achieve their goal and see the Queen's procession.
