Suraj (Govinda) has a unique skill of looking at a child and making a painting of how that child would look after growing up. One day, he is approached by a person with the photo of a girl child and is asked to paint the photo of how she would look when she grows up. He starts the work sincerely, just to realise the motive behind this request. His client wants to find the girl, who is now grown up, and kill her in order to become rich.
Suraj wants to help the girl. To put the killers offtrack, he instead paints the face of his dead wife.
What follows is a plot with lots twists and turns.
