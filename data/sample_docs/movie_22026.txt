Wolf Girl

Teenage girl Tara has a disease and hair growing all over her body and her face (hypertrichosis). She was born into a travelling Freak show circus and is the main attraction as Wolf Girl. Tara, often ridiculed by local teens, finds a friend in Ryan whose mother happens to work on an experimental depilatory treatment. Desperately longing to be normal, Tara starts to secretly inject herself with the drug, but unaware of the dangerous side effects... The animal within starts to reveal itself.
