School Bus

Joseph (Jayasurya) and Aparna (Aparna Gopinath) with their two children (Aakash Muraleedheeran and Angelleena Rosshan), symbolise a modern nuclear family. Joseph's son Ajoy often gets into a lot of trouble at school and so his father Joseph, a mild tempered business man often scolds him. The working and quarrelling parents, having no time to spare with the kids, lead the children to hide things away from them in the fear of getting scolded. The children, at first, takes into solving problems by themselves but later it goes out of their hands. Ajoy takes a flight to escape the wrath of everyone and finally lands in the middle of a deep forest. The story later revolves around the quest for Ajoy whereby his parents realise their mistakes and unite to find him. The two children are the main characters of this film which is based on a real life incident. Sub Inspector R Gopakumar (Kunchacko Boban) is a police officer who comes to enquire the missing of Ajoy. The film portrays the less stronger bonds in the modern nuclear families and also the attitude of the school authorities which put the students under pressure against even smaller mistakes committed by them.
