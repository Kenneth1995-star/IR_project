Allimuthu (Selva) is the lead performer of a Karakattam group based out of a village. Ranjani (Swathi), who studied in London, returns to her village in India. She is a modern and arrogant girl, and the daughter of the rich landlord Pannaiyar (Jaiganesh). Despite having different upbringings and social status, Allimuthu and Ranjani both fall in love with each other.
Allimuthu then gets an opportunity to perform in Delhi, there he meets a Britain girl named Timea (Timea) who is fond of Tamil culture. Upon his return, Allimuthu is accompanied by Timea. Allimuthu spends lot of time with Timea and he avoids Ranjani each time she wanted to talk to him. Ranjani was deeply struck by Allimuthu's behaviours, and one day Ranjani forces him to talk to her. Allimuthu reveals that he has never loved her, he then spits out blood and he faints. Timea tells Ranjani what really happened in Delhi.
In Delhi, Timea implored Allimuthu to teach her Karakattam and Allimuthu accepted it. In his hotel room, Allimuthu spit out blood, Timea came in time to rescue him and transported him to the hospital. The doctor revealed them that Allimuthu had blood cancer. Allimuthu decided to hide the truth to Ranjani and his family. He wanted Ranjani to hate him and therefore to forget him.
Afterwards, Ranjani summons a doctor from London to treat him from cancer. Allimuthu is then cured by cancer and Timea brings the couple together.
