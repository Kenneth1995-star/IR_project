I Am a Dad

Han Jong-sik (Kim Seung-woo) is a corrupt detective who frames innocent people to further his career. One of his victims takes his revenge on Jong-sik by killing his wife and injuring his daughter, Min-ji (Kim Sae-ron), who is now in need of a heart transplant. To help his sick daughter, he starts working for a mob boss who deals in organ trafficking. Na Sang-man (Son Byong-ho), a magician and one of the people he falsely accused of murder, discovers that his daughter is dead and his wife is in a coma because of a suicide attempt. Now, the only thing on his mind is vengeance. He is released after two years behind bars when the officials find out by accident that he is innocent. He tracks down Detective Kim (Im Ha-ryong), Jong-sik's colleague, to re-open the murder case. Meanwhile, Soo-kyung (Choi Jung-yoon), the organ transplant coordinator, locates a heart for Min-ji, but Jong-sik finds out that the heart is from Sang-man's wife. Realizing that Sang-man would not allow the transplant, he finds a way to get rid of him. Sang-man discovers his plans and kidnaps his daughter.[3][4]
