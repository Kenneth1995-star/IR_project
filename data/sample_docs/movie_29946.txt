Bharathan

Bharath (Vijayakanth) is sent to jail for a murder and he is sentenced to the death penalty.
In the past, Bharath was in love with Indhu (Bhanupriya). He had a brother Ramkumar (S. P. Balasubrahmanyam) and a sister-in-law Janaki (Sangeetha). His brother dreamt to see him as a government officer but Bharath preferred to be a kick-boxing champion.
One day, Ramkumar disappeared and Bharath began to look for him. Finally, Ramkumar's laborer (Chandrasekhar) explained to Bharath what happened to his brother. Gangadharan (Anandaraj), a powerful businessman, helped Ramkumar in his business. Ramkumar was grateful to him, Gangadharan took some advantages and began to smuggle alcohol illegally in Ramkumar's company. When Ramkumar decided to denounce it to the police, he was kidnapped by Gangadharan. Gangadharan killed Ramkumar and the innocent Bharath is arrested for the murder. Bharath appointed his family friend Viswanathan as advocate but Viswanathan, ally with Gangadharan, betrayed him and Bharath was sentenced to the capital punishment. Thereafter, his sister-in-law Janaki committed suicide.
In jail, Bharath makes friends with his cellmates and they escape from the jail to punish Gangadharan. Johnson (Napoleon), an honest C.I.D officer, is appointed to protect Gangadharan. Bharath first kills the traitor Viswanathan. Bharath then threatens the commissioner and his family to kill more easily Gangadharan.
In the meantime, Indhu is kidnapped by Gangadharan's henchmen and Bharath saves her at time. Shameful to protect a criminal and worried to punish an innocent, the commissioner and Johnson tries to stop Bharath. At the end, Bharath kills Gangadharan and he is sent to jail.
