Anjada Gandu

Young Santhu (Satish Neenasam) assists his father (T.S. Nagabharana) in construction work, and is in love with his neighbour Geetha (Subiksha). Unfortunately, Geetha's father (Suman) and uncles are the village's biggest bullies. When Santhu revals his love to Geetha, he is shocked to find that a planned marriage for Geetha had been arranged for her by her father. Santhu's friends kidnap Geetha to prevent the union, and when ultimately Geetha and Santhu are caught together, her father and uncles give Santhu a beating and he is chased from the village. Returning two years later, Santhu discovers that Geetha has not married. Still in love, he goes to her house and pleads with her to marry him. Her father catches the two together and demands he leave, but this time with Geetha.
