The Very Edge

Happily married couple Tracey (Anne Heywood) and architect Geofrey (Richard Todd) are expecting their first child, when one fateful day a maniac (Jeremy Brett) breaks into their home and rapes Tracey, causing her subsequent miscarriage. Unable to cope with life after the attack, Tracey starts to find all men alienating and repulsive, including her husband. Her trauma does not heal easily, and sooner rather than later, Geoffrey starts an affair with his secretary. In the meantime, Scotland Yard detective McInnes (Jack Hedley) has been unable to find the psychopath responsible for the assault, and Tracey's safety is still in question.
