Burning Man

Burning Man tells the story of Tom (Matthew Goode), a British chef in a Bondi restaurant, who seems to have chosen to disobey his boss, and his actions are tolerated by everyone around him. As Tom descends into darkness from a car crash in his Volkswagen, pieces of a different story start to emerge. Every woman around him tries, in different ways, to help Tom put himself back together.
