Uyir

Sundar (Srikanth) moves in with his brother's family, consisting of his brother, sister-in-law Arundathi (Sangeetha) and their daughter Aishwarya (Ramya). Sundar becomes very close to all three of them, but unbeknownst to him, Arundathi is interested in him. Sundar drops his niece off at school every day and meets his girlfriend Anandi (Samvritha) there. His brother is excited to learn about their relationship but soon afterward commits suicide. Arundathi claims that his suicide was caused by problems at work. Sundar becomes obligated to take care of his late brother's family, as Arundathi and Aishwarya have nowhere else to go. Arundathi tries her best to end Sundar's relationship with Anandi while subtly hinting to Sundar about her love for him. Anandi tries to warn Sundar about his conniving sister-in-law, but Arundathi succeeds in her plan. Did Sundar get together with Anandi or not is rest of the plot.
