The Flying Scotsman

Engine driver Bob is due to retire from his job after years of distinguished service. On Bob's last day working aboard the famous Flying Scotsman, a disgruntled fireman, dismissed after being reported for drinking at work, decides to get his revenge on Bob (who reported him to the company) by causing an accident. Meanwhile, the fireman's amorous young replacement has fallen in love with a beautiful girl, whose father, unbeknown to him, happens to be Bob (and who has also boarded the train in an attempt to stop the villain).[2]
