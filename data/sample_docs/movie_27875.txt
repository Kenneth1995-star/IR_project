There is a sum of Rs 75 Lakhs announced on his head by the police but Ibrahim hatches a plan to escape from India, by hijacking a plane with a union minister in it. He promises money to the young gang and seeks their help but in a fantastic twist in the aircraft, they kidnap Ibrahim for the bounty he carries!
But little do they realise that the criminals were hand-in-glove with the state police who try to track the youngsters. Now there is Narayana Swamy (Mohanlal), a sincere and efficient CBI officer from Mumbai who is out to track down Ibrahim.
