Ankhiyon Ke Jharokhon Se

This film is to some extent same as 'Sanam Teri Kasam.' Arun (Sachin), the son of a Barrister, and self-proclaimed prince of the male students finds his pride and huge ego crushed when he stands second in the Terminal Examination. He loses to Lily Fernandes (Ranjeeta), the simple and modest daughter of an ordinary nurse in a private nursing home. Arun takes this as a defeat, who then decides to nurse a personal vendetta to try and crush Lily's growing popularity in school. Lily, however, tolerates him and his friends' remarks and sarcasm as she bears no grudge against him.
As time goes on, they gradually discover the basic qualities of their opponents, one becoming the admirer of the other. They visit beautiful places together on weekends to get to know each other better. Lily's mother is the first person to notice the love blossoming between her daughter and Arun. She is worried, because even though Arun is madly in love with her daughter, social status has to be considered. Despite this, Arun's father approves and presents a proposal to Lily's mother to allow their children to marry.
When everything is going well, Lily falls ill and is discovered to have leukemia. Everyone tries to save the girl, and Lily and Arun act as if nothing was wrong. Everything seems fine for a while, but Lily's condition grows worse. She dies in Arun's arms as she makes him promise to rise in life so that she would be at peace.
