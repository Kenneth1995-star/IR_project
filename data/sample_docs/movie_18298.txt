The Queen's Affair

Poor New York shop girl Nadina (Anna Neagle) receives unexpected news of an inheritance, and learns she is next in line to be queen of an Eastern European country. On her arrival in Ruritania, a revolution is in progress, and only minutes before her coronation, Nadina is forced into exile. She flees to Paris with her nurse (Muriel Aked), and then travels on to Switzerland. There Nadina encounters the Ruritanian revolutionary leader Carl (Fernand Gravey), recuperating from the trials of revolution, and the couple unexpectedly fall in love. When the revolution collapses in Ruritania, they return and marry, thus forming a constitutional monarchy supported by all the people.
