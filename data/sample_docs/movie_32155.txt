Flashback unveils in the second half. One of the persons (Jatin) who works under Bhavani Prasad gets bashed up by goons of the rival faction – Nagayalanka Narasinga Naidu (JP Reddy) for no reason of him. They presume that he wrote love letters to his daughter Siva Nageshwari and trash the pulp out of him. Due to this, Jatin becomes a cripple for life. Bhavani Prasad vows to get Nageswari married to Jatin, but the story takes a U-turn from then. Another of Bhavani’s rivals – Mukesh Rushi joins hands with Narasinga Naidu and plans to damage Bhavani’s image and withhold Siva Nageshwari’s marriage. It is also revealed that Mukesh Rushi’s son fell in love with Bhavani’s sister who rejected his love and married someone else. To avenge these defaming incidents both these villains unite.
