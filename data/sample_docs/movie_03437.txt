Sweater Girl

While preparing for Midvale College's upcoming revue, which includes a trick shot with a gun, singer Susan Lawrence develops a romantic interest in Jack Mitchell, who also sings, while their friend Louise Menard is seeing Susan's brother, a professor. All are shocked when songwriter Johnny Arnold is strangled and school reporter Miles Tucker poisoned with the glue from an envelope.
A detective named McGill begins an investigation. One night Jack volunteers to look after Louise's mother, a helpless invalid. Susan becomes worried and, when she arrives, Mrs. Menard is trying to help Jack, who has narrowly avoided being killed.
With help from Louise's father, a professor, McGill deduces that Mrs. Menard is holding a grudge from a previous child's death, which she blames on an initiation rite at the school. She has also secretly exchanged Susan's trick gun with a loaded one, which she uses in the show. Everyone arrives too late, but luckily, Susan's aim is bad, Jack survives and all live happily ever after.
