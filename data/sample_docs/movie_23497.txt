Troublesome Night 15

Ngau's grandfather was a hanjian during the Second Sino-Japanese War; he murdered Keung and Keung's family. Keung became a vengeful ghost after death, seeking revenge on the Ngau family. Ngau's wife was killed by Keung's ghost shortly after giving birth to their son, Fai. Ngau is afraid of losing Fai so he asks Mrs Bud Lung, an expert ghostbuster, to help him. She suggests that he operates a food stall at night to attract some ghost patrons and ask them to protect his family from Keung. When Fai grows up, he gets seduced by Sally, who tries to trick him into selling his father's land. If the land is sold, Ngau will lose ownership of the food stall and the ghost patrons can no longer protect his family. Fai knocks his father unconscious, steals his seal and signs a contract with Sally to sell the land â€“ only to realise that she has deceived him. Although Ngau's friends manage to destroy the contract later, it is too late as Keung has already caused Fai to die in a car accident. Out of love for his son, Ngau sacrifices himself to appease Keung, and Fai is brought back to life. In memory of his father, Fai and his wife continue to operate the food stall to serve ghost patrons.
