Dance Band

When dance band leader Buddy Milton (Charles 'Buddy' Rogers) competes in a contest with a female orchestra, he falls in love with its leader, Pat Shelley (June Clyde). Intense rivalry between the two bands and the machinations of a crooked business manager (Fred Duprez), serve as romantic obstacles along the way.
