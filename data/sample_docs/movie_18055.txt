The Great Day

As described in a film publication,[2] Frank Beresford (Burleigh) and Clara Borstwick (Hume) have married against the wishes of her father, Sir John Borstwick (Bourchier). Immediately following the marriage, Lillian Leeson (Albanesi), to whom Frank had formerly been married, appears with the intent to blackmail. Frank had told Clara of the former marriage and had believed that Lillian was dead. Frank goes to Paris to find a former friend that he believed to be dead who was a former husband of Lillian. He recognizes Dave Leeson (Kerr) and they return to England. Dave frustrates the attempt by Lillian to spoil Frank's happiness, and there is a reconciliation with Clara.
