Bala (Rahman) is a singer in a musical ensemble with his friends Ajith (Hariraj), Ajith's girlfriend Amritha (Anusha), Nambi Charle and Wilson (Kumaresan). They are not enough popular to get decent assignments. One day, they get the chance to perform in an important function and they have an outstanding performance there. The famous Indian concert organizer J. R. (Vijayakumar) appreciates their performance and he gives them an opportunity to perform in Sri Lanka.
In the meantime, many cities of India are punctuated by several terrorist incidents. The terrorists used remote-controlled cars 'detonator' to commit those attacks. The CBI officer Indra (Vijayashanti) is charged to dismantle the terrorist group. She finally captures Dawood (Viswajith), the leader of the terrorist group but he later manages to escape from jail and he lands in Takistan, a dangerous and corrupt country.
J. R. has also another faceÂ : he is an international arms dealer, he sells weapons to terrorists. J. R. with Kannan and his friends move to Takistan to perform in a concert. There, J. R. meets the terrorist Dawood who is sought by the CBI. J. R. thinks that Dawood's presence may lure the CBI so J. R.'s partner Malik (Bakhtiyar), a Takistan's secret agent, killed Dawood. J. R. then plans to kill the Indian scientist Kaladharan (Nizhalgal Ravi) who is on the brink of finding a solution to disable the remote-controlled cars. When Bala comes to know the matter, he immediately informs his friends by phone but J. R. sees him and his henchmen brutally murder Bala. Ajith, Nambi and Wilson seek justice for their late friend Bala, they inform Indra about J. R.'s illegal activities. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
