Lifeu Ishtene

Vishal (Diganth) is a carefree youngster who is only serious about pursuing a career in music. In contrast, his friend Shivakumar "Shivu" (Sathish Ninasam) is serious about life and advises him to reform. But Vishal, whose parents allow him a lot of freedom, finds his own way to deal with hook ups. He falls in love with his collegemate, Nandini (Sindhu Loknath), who also falls in love with him. After a brief period of courtship, they decide to get married. Nandini wants Vishal to take up a job as it will help her discuss the marriage proposal with her father. He thinks she is the one for him, but only till the point where he has to choose between his music career and her, at which point they break up.
Vishal then meets a journalism aspirant, Rashmi (Samyukta Hornad), who films him, for her academic project. Nandini, initially reluctant, gets married to Chandan, as arranged by her father. Vishal has an awkward confrontation with her at the wedding. Rashmi, however, falls in love with him instantly and is ready to marry him. Having spent some time together, Vishal also falls in love with her, who eventually parts with her, on witnessing her being approached by an old pursuer, who he connects to, in context of Nandini.
Six months later, Shivu is diagnosed with cancer and is living his final days, and Vishal, working in Dubai, has been in touch with him. He returns to India to reconcile with Rashmi, now working as a television journalist, and finds her dating Suraj (Pawan Kumar). The film ends with Vishal's epilogue on how, in the context of love, life comes a full circle.
