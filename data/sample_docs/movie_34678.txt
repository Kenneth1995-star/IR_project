Slow Video

Yeo Jang-boo possesses dynamic visual acuity, which enables him to visually discern fine detail in a moving object that ordinary people cannot, as if he's seeing the world in slow motion. Due to his special ability, Jang-boo has to constantly wear sunglasses, which made him a target of bullying at school and throughout his childhood. He spends 20 years isolated and alone, but his talent proves to be a gift later in life when he finally goes out into the world and ends up working at his neighbor's CCTV control center. One day while unenthusiastically watching passersby onscreen, he spots his first love Bong Soo-mi. Despite being terrible at social interactions, Jang-boo sets out to win her heart.
