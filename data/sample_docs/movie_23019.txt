Young People

Martial arts club member Ho Tai's (Chen Kuan-tai) girlfriend Princess (Irene Chan) is the school babe, who also attracts the pursuit by star athlete Lam Tat (Ti Lung). Lam always ridicules Ho and they develop a bad relation. On the other hand, music club leader Hung Wai (David Chiang), who came from a family of martial arts, teaches martial arts to his club members to raise their spirits. Because of Princess, Lam got into a fight with Ho during jogging practice and Hung came to break up the fight. The two finally buried their hatchet. During the school's cart racing competition, Lam and Ho, out of gratitude for Hung, help him win the championship.
