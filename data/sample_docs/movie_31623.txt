Seetarama Kalyanam

The story begins Ravana (N. T. Rama Rao) is stopped by Nandi when he goes straight to Kailasa to get darshan of Lord Shiva. A rift happens between Ravana and Nandi and the latter curses Ravana saying he would die at the hands of “Vaanaras”. Ravana doesn’t bother the curse and does a severe penance to shake the foundations of Kailasa. Lord Shiva feels delighted with the penance and grants Ravana few wishes to be fulfilled. As a result, Ravana becomes invincible. With the penance of sages and divine people, Lakshmi Devi (Geethanjali) is born on Planet Earth as Vedavathi who sacrifices her body to Ravana. Ravana lusts for her and tries to capture her. She immediately gets reborn in Lanka and says that she would destroy him, thereby turning into ashes. On the word of Mandodari (B. Saroja Devi), the Rakshasas collect the ashes into a box and bury it in Janaka's (Mikkilineni) kingdom. Janaka in the meantime performs puja for children and while tilling the ground, a baby girl in a box is found. He names her Seetha and looks after her with affection and care. On the other side in Ayodhya, Dasaradha (Chittor V Nagaiah) is blessed with four sons who are the reincarnations of Lord Vishnu (Haranath), Adhi Sesha, Shanka and Chakra as Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatragnya. Rama and Laksmana (Shobhan Babu) go as a security for Vishwamitra's (Gummadi) Yaaga ritual. After it is finished, they go to the Janaka Kingdom for the Swayamvara of Seetha. Ravana also arrives for the Swayamvara in order to break the Shiva’s Bow which is the condition to marry Seetha. But he fails to do so and gets insulted. Rama breaks the Shiva’s Bow and when Parasurama (K.V.S.Sharma) challenges the abilities of the former, the latter realizes the value of Rama and his reincarnation. The film ends with the phenomenal wedding of Seeta & Rama.
