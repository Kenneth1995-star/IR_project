Seth Dharamdas has two daughters: the older one is Asha (Vidya Sinha) and the younger one is Kaajal (Kaajal Kiran). Dharamdas had struck a business deal with Dhanraj. Here, Asha marries her love interest Akash (Vinod Mehra), but he dies in an air crash. Asha grieves his loss, following which, Dharamdas cancels his plan to sell the factory and decides to dedicate the factory as a souvenir to Akash.
Dhanraj doesn't want this deal be cancelled and hence bribes Dharamdas's trusted employees Manmohan Saxena (Roopesh Kumar), Ashok Gupta (Narendra Nath), and Rita (Padma Khanna) into helping him to kill Dharamdas. Dharamdas has to go to Nainital for a business trip. However, he is approached by Dhanraj, Ashok, and Manmohan in the train itself and is forced to sign an agreement that would entitle Dhanraj to be the sole owner of all his riches.
Dharamdas does as told, however the crooks kill him and bury him nearby. During the fracas, Ashok's knife falls down into the grave, but he is in a hurry and doesn't have time to take it out. In the meantime, Asha and Kaajal are being looked after by Ajit Roy, who used to hold a responsible post in the factory during Dharamdas's ownership. Ajit Roy strikes up another deal with Dhanraj.
Suddenly, the "ghost" of Dharamdas starts confronting his killers. The villains die due to the shock of seeing him. A wave of panic runs among the killers. Dharamdas's daughters are unaware of the truth, as they believe that their father has gone missing. Dharamdas's case is given to Inspector Anand (Navin Nischol), an old friend of Akash. When the villains start dying mysteriously, Anand becomes confident that there is some connection between the deaths and the disappearance of Dharamdas.
Anand sets up traps, confident that Dharamdas is still alive and killing his associates for some still unknown reason. He has no luck until Dhanraj is killed. Anand sees Dharamdas and shoots him. The rest needs to be seen.
