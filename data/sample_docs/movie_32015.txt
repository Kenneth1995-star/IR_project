Seetha (Aamani) is a possessive wife who suspects that all the women in the world are throwing themselves at her husband, Madhu (Jagapathi Babu). Things get a little interesting only after Sudha (Ranjitha) enters the picture and ends up hugging Madhu right in front of Seetha's eyes. Seetha is diagnosed with a deadly heart condition and decides to have Madhu and Sudha to tie the knot for the sake of a good life for her young son. She even goes as far as getting a divorce from Madhu to make him hate her. In the end, Seetha dies, while giving birth to a female child and Madhu and Sudha get married by naming the baby as Seetha.
