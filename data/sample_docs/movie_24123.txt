Dekha, Na-Dekhay

The story of the film revolves around the life of a 23-year-old boy from a North Kolkata family named Anupam (played by Samadarshi Dutta). He stays with his mother (Laboni Sarkar) and uncle (Koushik Bandyopadhyay). He is totally spoiled and pampered, has not learnt to stand on his own feet yet, and is more like a child than a man of his age. He has no idea of the world outside. He is dreamy and spends his time doing nothing. His uncle was looking for a bride for him. Harish (Prasun Gayen), his senior in college comes across him one day and offers to help his uncle to look for a bride for Anupam. He suggested Dr Shambhunath's (Mrinal Mukherjee) daughter Kalyani (Debosmita Saha) for his friend. After a little persuasion, Anupam's uncle approves of the alliance. But on the day of the marriage, Anupam's uncle insults Kalyani's father. As a result, Kalyani refuses to marry Anupam. She and her father goes away to a place far away. This affects Anupam badly who decides to do something about it. He leaves his house and goes away in search of Kalyani. He finds her and offers to help her in her work. Though she has sworn never to get married, she finally relents in allowing Anupam to be with her and help in her work.[1][2]
