Gagarin: First in Space

On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin blasted off in a Vostok rocket, becoming the first human in space and orbiting Earth for 108 minutes. He was one of the first group of cosmonauts who were selected from over three thousand fighter pilots throughout the Soviet Union.
The legendary top twenty who were selected were the ace of aces and none of the pilots knew which amongst them would make history on the first manned flight. Once chosen Gagarin is fast-tracked to train for the unknown and the trip of a lifetime.
Whilst strapped into his rocket, Gagarin reflects on his life, which is intercut with the determination of the Russian space team and their untiring efforts to conquer space.
