Sleeping Car to Trieste

The setting is almost entirely on a train travelling between Paris and Trieste in post-war Europe. Two rather mysterious people, Zurta (Albert Lieven) and Valya (Jean Kent), are at ease in sophisticated society. On Valya's behalf, Zurta steals a diary from an embassy in Paris, but, in doing so, kills an embassy guard. Poole, an accomplice, is passed the diary, but he double-crosses them and attempts to escape with it on the Orient Express. Just in time, Valya and Zurta also board the train.
They try tracking down Poole who is trying to stay hidden in a train compartment. Some other travellers become involved, including a U.S. Army sergeant with an eye for the ladies, an adulterous couple, an idiot stockbroker, a wealthy, autocratic writer and his brow-beaten secretary/valet, a bird watcher, and a French police inspector. The train staff and other passengers provide some more light-hearted scenes.
The diary is discovered by accident and passes through the hands of several people on the train, but after Zurta is eventually confronted by the police inspector on suspicion of having killed Poole, Zurta regains the diary and attempts to escape by leaping from the train, but he lands directly in the path of a train travelling in the opposite direction.
