Azhagaana Ponnuthan

Parthiban appears in the very first reel recollecting his travels with a woman whom he had developed an affinity in his teens.
A flashback takes one to Kodaikanal where Karthik (Karteesh) falls instantly for a gorgeous woman called Jennifer (Namitha), who is older to him. She is admired and respected by everyone, especially men.
It is all but Karthik's wild imagination is the rest. Karthik sings duets with Jennifer and runs behind her. However, in the latter half, he goes into a shell brooding over his love and beloved. Twists and turns reveal that Jenniferâ€™s husband has died in the Indo-Pak war of 1971. What happens then forms the climax.
