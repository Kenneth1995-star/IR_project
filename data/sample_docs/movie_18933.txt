Into the Blue

Mr and Mrs Fergusson (Jack Hulbert & Constance Cummings) are relaxing on board a chartered yacht taking them to Oslo, Norway, but after leaving England discover they have a stowaway (Michael Wilding), who is on the run from the police. He was asked to take two suitcases to Monte Carlo, but on examination at the airport they contained stolen watches, so he grabbed the cases and ran. All attempts by the couple to remove him from the yacht fail, and they end up going to Rouen, Paris, and finally Monte Carlo. In the meantime, romance has blossomed between Nicholas the stowaway, and Jackie, the young niece of the skipper. They plan to get married, but first Nicholas decides to confront the smugglers, then turn himself in to the police. Unknown to him, the police have been tailing him ever since he left England, and follow him to the hotel, where they overhear him talking with the head of the smugglers, whom they have been trying to nail for years. The smugglers get a prison sentence, while Nicholas receives a caution, and he is free to catch up with the yacht, now on its way back to England.[3]
