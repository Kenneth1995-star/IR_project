Sunyo Je Kol

Sumi, a 25-year-old girl maintains her family by giving private tuition. Suddenly they have a huge monetary requirement due to heart surgery of her widowed sister's six-year-old daughter. Desperate in thoughts, she finds an advertisement in newspaper for surrogate mother for an affluent lawyer.
Due to low information on the subject of surrogate motherhood, Sumi nor the lawyer are initially aware that a surrogate mother must be married and have at least one child. Still Sumi becomes a mother. She gets the promised Rs 5 lakhs but pays a heavy price. Her boyfriend severs ties, society rejects her and her tuitions are discontinued. Once the baby is born and she has to hand him over to the lawyer and his wife, she feels the heart-rending pain of separation.[2]
