Hillsong: Let Hope Rise

The film chronicles the unlikely rise to prominence of the Australia-based Christian band Hillsong United.[4][5] Their music is so popular it is estimated that on any given Sunday, more than 50 million churchgoers around the world are singing their songs.[6] The film follows an event that took place on 23 October 2014 at the Forum arena in Los Angeles with 17,000 people attending, and moments preceding the concert with the creation of new songs featured on Empires (2015).[7]
