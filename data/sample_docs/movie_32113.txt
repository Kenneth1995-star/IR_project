Snehamante Idera

Aravind (Nagarjuna Akkineni), Chandru (Sumanth) and Krishna Murthy (Sudhakar) are childhood friends. Chandru and Krishna Murthy are orphans, who are generously brought up by the parents of Aravind. By the time they reach their 20's, Aravind's sister Amrita (Pratyusha) falls in love with Chandru. Chandru hesitates to love her, as she is the sister of his close friend. Chandru seeks the help of Krishna Murthy to avoid Amrita. After the entire episode, Aravind and Chandru go to Hyderabad to work with Krishna Murthy. When this trio is assigned to renovate an old palatial house, Aravind encounters Padmini (Bhoomika Chawla). A mischief by the jealous cousin of Padmini results in Aravind falling for Padmini. When Padmini is about to get engaged to another guy, Chandru announces that Padmini cheated Aravind after loving him. Aravind and Padmini realize that Padmini's jealous cousin's responsible for ruining everything. Aravind's jealous cousin lies to Chandu that Aravind intentionally killed Chandu's brother. Aravind kicks his evil cousin out of the house. Chandu tries to save Aravind, but Aravind's hand is too slippery and Aravind falls off the mountain. Although Chandu tried to save Aravind, Chandu blames himself. Chandu realizes that his brother was accidentally killed by Aravind. Few years later, Chandu reunites with Aravind's family.
