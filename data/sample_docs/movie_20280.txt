Cruel Passion

Justine is a young virgin thrown out of a French orphanage and into the depraved world of prostitution. She slips into a life of debauchery, torture, whipping, slavery and salaciousness while her brazen, flirtatious and liberated sister Juliette ironically receives nothing but happiness and reward for her wanton behavior.
