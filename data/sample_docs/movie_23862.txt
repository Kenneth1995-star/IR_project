Ex with Benefits

After a tumultuous med school romance that comes to an abrupt end, Dr. Adam Castrances and Arkisha "Arki" Aragon meet again ten years later. Arki is a pharmaceutical sales representative with a track record of doing anything to make a sale. Adam is a doctor of sports medicine with a successful blog and commitment issues. When Arki finds that it will take more than her usual sales tactics to convince Adam to endorse her product, she does her best to step up her game without falling in love again but eventually fails. Their second chance at love is tested, however, when the reasons for their med school breakup come to the surface.
