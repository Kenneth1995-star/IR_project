One day, forest officer Vikram Singh comes in their circle with his wife Sonali and daughter Nisha. Vikram Singh tries to arrest the smugglers and they kill Vikram and Sonali. Only Nisha is left. Nisha's Grandpa Trilokchand comes in the house and sees the dead bodies, he promises, that he must take revenge. He is framed by Zoravar and Trilok is found guilty of murder and serves 11 years jail. Nisha, although a simple girl of a village, recollects the murder scene of his parents. Her uncle Bajrang takes her to a Tantrik's who gives a snake poison pill to Nisha and due to such pill she becomes a Vishkanya (Poison girl). When her grandpa Trilok returns from jail, they jointly take revenge.
