Main Street After Dark

Lt. Lorrigan has his hands full with the Dibson criminal family. Ma Dibson's thieving son Lefty is about to get out of prison. Her daughter Rosalie and Lefty's wife Jessie Belle pick up military servicemen in bars and steal from them.
Lorrigan keeps an eye on all. He frisks Lefty's brother Posey, warning the Dibsons to keep out of trouble. Lefty immediately plans to rob McBain, owner of the bar where Rosalie and Jessie Belle fleece the servicemen.
Using guns from pawnbroker Keller, expressly against Ma's wishes, Lefty falls into Lt. Lorrigan's trap, with undercover cops disguised as soldiers. In the struggle, Posey is accidentally shot. Lefty, Ma and the girls are all placed under arrest.
