Amrit Manthan

The story is about a reformist king Kantivarma (Varde) who bans the sacrifice of animals and humans. This angers the fanatical Rajguru (Chandra Mohan), head priest of the Chandika cult. The cult meets secretly and the head priest orders the killing of the king. Yashodharma is chosen and though he hesitates, the priest orders him to do so. Yashodharma writes a note for his son before leaving that night telling him of the deed planned by the Rajguru. After the King is killed, Yashodharma (Kulkarni) is betrayed by the Rajguru in court and ordered to be killed. Yashodharma's two children, Madhavgupt (Mane) and Sumitra (Shanta Apte), are on the run but Madhav is caught and the letter found on him by one of Rajguru's men. Sumitra is taken prisoner and Rani Mohini (Nalin Tarkhud) who succeeds to the throne after her father's death is asked to have Madhav sacrificed in the temple by the Rajguru. There is a storm and Mohini and Madhav escape to the forest. Madhav later goes in search of his sister. Vishwasgupt (Kelkar), a trusted minister tells Mohini and the people of Avanti about Rajguru being the real killer. The temple is thronged by townspeople demanding justice and the Rajguru with his obsessive belief in sacrifices offers himself to the goddess and cuts off his own head as a final sacrifice.
