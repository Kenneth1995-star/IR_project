Agnipath

The story starts by showing a happy family, who include Sujay, Ajay and Bijay. Sujay worked in the factory of Bhuban Choudhury. Ajay wanted to become an IPS officer. An unemployed Bijay was searching for a job. Sujay's wife Anjali looked after all the needs of his two siblings.
Rahim was a very close friend of Sujay, who was very connected to his family members. One day, a worker in Sujay's factory loses a hand in an accident at work. Seeing this, Sujay advised Bhuban to give compensation to the worker's family, to which Bhuban refused. To protest this, Sujay calls a strike.
Meanwhile, Ajay fell in love with Bhuban's daughter, Swati, and they eloped against the will of Sujay. An angry Sujay ordered Ajay to leave the house and a serious dispute takes place between Anjali and Swati, only resulting in abuses offered by Sujay to Ajay. After this incident, Ajay left the house with Swati.
Bijay went to a bank for a job interview when suddenly the bank was attacked by some robbers. Seeing this, Bijay showed great courage by tackling the robbers and he became successful in saving everyone in the bank. A young lady named Sharmila was there, and she and Bijay fell in love. Sharmila's father Mr. Bakshi, who was a Colonel, invited Bijay to join the Indian Army.
In the meantime, Bhuban Choudhury, who was attempting to take revenge on Sujay, brought fake claims against him, due to which everyone in the factory misunderstood him. Later, Sujay saw an illegal activity going on in the factory. Bhuban Choudhury was involved in a drug smuggling business with Singh, a dangerous criminal.
Bhuban and Singh learn that their deeds were witnessed by Sujay. They kidnap Sujay and murder him. Bijay and Rahim were determined to take revenge on Bhuban and Singh after this event. The film ends as they kill the two criminals and surrender themselves to the police.[3]
