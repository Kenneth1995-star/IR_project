Chitram Bhalare Vichitram

Raja (Naresh), Sudhakar (Subhalekha Sudhakar), Raghava (Maharshi Raghava), Brahmanandam (Brahmanandam) are good friends and stay together as tenants at Gorojanala Garudachalam (Kota Srinivasa Rao). After being thrown out of the house they start searching new house for rent but no one are ready to give their house for bachelors.
Finally, they land up in a place where the landlady insists on having a family as her tenants. The four bachelors dress up to be a man (Sudhakar), his retarded brother (Raghava), his father (Brahmanandam) and his wife (Naresh). Now Naresh's (called "Prema" and who happens to be in a woman's attire) lady love happens to be the landlady's daughter and all hell breaks loose.
