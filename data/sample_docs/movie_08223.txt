Gunn

A gangster named Scarlotti once saved private detective Peter Gunn's life, but now Scarlotti's been killed and Fusco intends to take over the town's crime syndicate.
Gunn is determined to find out who the killer is, and soon he and Lt. Jacoby are convinced that Fusco himself must be behind it. Fusco denies it and gives a deadline to Gunn, to solve the murder or end up dead himself.
