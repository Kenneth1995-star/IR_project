Pravarakhyudu

Sasi (Jagapathi Babu), a professor of biology at Harvard University of the US, makes a comeback to his native place. He makes an attempt to settle in life for which he prompts a couple of alliances. But, they don't fit into his mindset. His friend Ravi (Sunil) brings out a logic that Sasi is still not able to forget his classmate Sailaja (Priyamani). The hero goes nostalgic about his college days. A decade ago… Sasi and Sailaja were classmates in a college. Packs of guys were after Sailaja, the college beauty. Sailaja loves him, but Sasi’s ideology about love irritates Sailaja a lot and she is averse to his philosophy. Failing completely in wooing the modern Pravarakhyudu, Sailaja gives up the idea and go her way. Sasi realizes that Sailaja works as a principal in a women’s college and she is unmarried too. Afresh, Sasi enters a college as a lecturer in biology, in the principal. The rest of the story is all about how Sasi makes Sailaja fall in love with him again.
