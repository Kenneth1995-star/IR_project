Alice in Earnestland

Soo-nam is a poor woman struggling to pay the hospital bills for her vegetative husband's care, even though her hard work seems to be hopeless. She is suddenly granted the chance for a turnabout when a redevelopment project takes place. When that falls through, Soo-nam discards her honesty and adapts a cold-blooded approach to take revenge on whoever is responsible for her debt-ridden life.
