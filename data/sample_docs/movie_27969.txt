The ACP Balaji Shakthivel (Pasupathy) who is an upright cop, put in charge of investigations, tries his level best but cannot fetch any evidence to prove anything related. They soon find out that the murder was one of the many meticulously planned operations, aimed to check the teacher's intrusions into unlawful exporting of children from Kochi.
