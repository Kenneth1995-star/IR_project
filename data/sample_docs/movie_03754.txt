Career Girl

Kansas City girl Joan Terry has come to New York to conquer Broadway as thousands have before her. Advised to maintain an appearance of wealth, she has been living in an expensive hotel until she is discovered. With no offers coming in she moves to an economical women's boarding house full of equally unsuccessful actresses, singers, and dancers.
However, when Joan demonstrates her ability in the traditional newcomer's show for the residents, the girls recognise her considerable talent and form a corporation to support her until she is discovered and can pay them back from her earnings.
Joan has a further problem when her impatient fianc√©e, a Kansas City coal mines owner, orders her to return home in failure to become his meek housewife. When she carries on in her plans, he arrives in New York to sabotage her aspiring career.
