Yahşi Batı

Two special agents, Aziz and Lemi, are tasked by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire with delivering a diamond as a gift to the American president. As they ride on a stagecoach across the American wild west, they are robbed of the diamond by bandits, leaving them stranded without any money. A tough cowgirl, Susanne Van Dyke (a character like Calamity Jane) joins them on their quest.
