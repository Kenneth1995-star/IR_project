Two Weddings and a Funeral

A gay man, Min-soo (Kim Dong-yoon) and a lesbian, Hyo-jin (Ryu Hyun-kyung) are both promising doctors at a general hospital. The colleagues agree to marry so Hyo-jin can legally adopt a child with her lover of ten years Seo-young (Jung Ae-yeon), and Min-soo can please his parents while maintaining his closeted lifestyle. While secretly living with their respective partners, who move in next door, Min-soo and Hyo-jin appear to be a happy, "normal" couple. They enjoy all the benefits afforded to heterosexual couples and are also able to ward off public scrutiny and parental disapproval. However, Min-soo's intrusive parents begin to get a bit too involved with the couple's life, threatening their scheme.
