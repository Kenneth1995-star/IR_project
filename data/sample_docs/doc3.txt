Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels.
These activities increase levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.
Global warming leads to rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts.
Mitigation strategies include renewable energy adoption, reforestation, and reducing carbon emissions.
