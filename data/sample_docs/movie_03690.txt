Three Hearts for Julia

Foreign correspondent Jeff Seabrook's prolonged absences are frustrating his musician wife Julia so much, she is planning a divorce. Jeff hasn't told her he is on his way home. Julia hasn't told him she is leaving him, with orchestra manager David Torrance and music critic Philip Barrows both already wooing her.
Jeff's newspaper editor John Girard advises him to act as if he accepts her decision. Julia tries to concentrate on her music, playing in an all-girl band (due to the war), which new conductor Anton Ottaway resents, feeling the music is too low-brow.
Although temporarily off-duty from his job, Jeff is suddenly called up for active military duty. He takes Julia against her will to a remote cabin, forcing her to think about her decision to get a divorce, angering her suitors, who believe she's gone off with her husband deliberately. Jeff doesn't tell Julia he's going off to do his duty for Uncle Sam, but she takes him back anyway.
