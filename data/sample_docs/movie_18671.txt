Candlelight in Algeria

The story is loosely based on the secret conference in Cherchell, Algeria, in October 1942, between American General Mark W. Clark and a group of high-ranking French Vichy commanders, where they agreed not to resist the Operation Torch landings in Vichy controlled French North Africa a month later.
Ahead of the conference, British agent Alan Thurston (James Mason) has been assigned to travel to Algiers to recover a camera containing pictures that reveals where it will take place. He doesn't know anything about the meeting or what the pictures in the camera may reveal, but has been ordered to prevent the camera from reaching the Germans. He does know, however, that he is being shadowed by German spy Dr. Müller (Walter Rilla), who intends to steal the camera as soon as Thurston gets it. So how will he be able to get the camera without Müller discovering it?
Susan Foster (Carla Lehmann), an American sculptress living in Biskra, agrees to help Thurston. In Algiers, she steals the camera from the bedroom of collaborating nightclub singer Martiza (Enid Stamp-Taylor), but instead of handing over the camera to Thurston, she plans to take it to the American consulate. However, her opinion of Thurston quickly changes when he rescues her from the clutches of Müller. The duo takes cover in a kasbah with Thurston’s French friend Yvette (Pamela Stirling), and they develop the film there. Thurston recognises the place in the photos, so they shoot their way out of the kasbah and race to the meeting place to warn the Allied officers.
