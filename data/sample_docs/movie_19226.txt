One Good Turn

Norman lives at Greenwood children's home, south of London, where he grew up. He has stayed on and serves as carer and general dogsbody. He regards the staff and children there as his family, and when Jimmy, one of the boys, sets his heart on a model car he's seen in a shop window, Norman is determined to raise the money to buy it. But he can't afford it on his meagre wages and Matron won't provide the money.
On a train trip to Brighton, which he's keen to join because he's never seen the sea, Norman joins in a London to Brighton walking race. He wins, but fails to sell the silver cup he's been awarded to a pawnbroker, wno thinks it's been stolen. At a local fair, he enters a boxing competition. He actually wins, but the crooked promoter cheats him of his winnings. The audience have seen what happened and have a whip-round for him, which raises fifteen shillings.
Norman return to the Home, but finds it in a state of siege. The chairman of the trustees is also a crooked property speculator and wants to evict the kids so that a factory can be built on the site.
The defenders are successful and the home is saved.
