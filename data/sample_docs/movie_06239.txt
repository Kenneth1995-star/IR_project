O’Keefe (Steve Catlett) stars as an American G.I. who remained in Italy after the war to manage a car dealership. He falls in love with a secretary (Mara Lane), and after only one date with her, she asks him to dispose of her boss’ body, who has died of a heart attack in her apartment. O'Keefe places the body in the trunk of the wrong car and watches helplessly as Lane drives away with it. O’Keefe then goes about trying to fix the situation, but a police inspector (Arnoldo Foà) and Lane’s sadistic husband (Rossano Brazzi) have ulterior motives in store for him.[2]
