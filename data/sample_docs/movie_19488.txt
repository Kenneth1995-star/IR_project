The Angry Silence

The story is about working class factory worker Tom Curtis (Richard Attenborough) who refuses to take part in an unofficial strike organised by agent provocateur Travers (Alfred Burke). Curtis finds himself ostracised by the other workers and accused of being a scab. Curtis has two children and his wife, Anna (Pier Angeli) is pregnant. He faces a painful dilemma when choosing between doing what is morally right (and the choice of his fellow work colleagues) and what is bidden by the rules. He is not persuaded to participate in the strike by violence, as some of the other dissenters, but is given the silent treatment instead.[4]
