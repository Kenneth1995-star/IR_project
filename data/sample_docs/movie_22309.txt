Cas & Dylan

Dr. Cas Pepper is a 61-year-old man, a self-proclaimed loner, and terminally ill. Dylan is a 22-year-old woman, a social misfit, and an aspiring writer. She is currently living with her boyfriend, Bobby. Cas reluctantly agrees to give Dylan Morgan a short lift to her home. Cas accidentally strikes Bobby with his car and finds himself a fugitive from the law.
Cas and Dylan take off on a drive across Canada. Dylan is eager to help Cas deal with his own case of writer's block. Cas has been contemplating suicide, had wanted to take a one-trip drive towards the west, and had planned to leave behind a suicide note. But the writer's block prevents him from coming up with anything to write.
Cas and Dylan jointly experience an adventure which opens their eyes to some of life's lessons, both big and small.
