Love Actually... Sucks!

Love Actually... Sucks! was inspired by real-life events, and opens with a dramatic wedding feast. It tells a variety of stories about love that has gone wrong: a brother and sister in an illicit relationship, a married painter who falls in love with his young male life model, a dance school teacher who becomes involved with his senior student, a role-playing lesbian couple, and a complex love triangle. The film celebrates the belief that life is love.[2][3]
