Pookkalam Varavayi

Five-year-old Geethu's (Shamili) parents (played by Murali and Geetha) get divorced, so she now stays 4days a week with her mom and 3days with her dad as per the court's order. She becomes friendly with Nandan (Jayaram), the driver of her school bus.
During her Christmas vacation, Geethu decides to go to Nandan's village without informing her parents. Nandan's sister (played by Rekha) had recently lost her daughter, who was the same age as Geethu, when she drowned in the village river. Nandan's lover is Tulasi (Sunitha). Geethu wins the heart of everyone in the village and becomes the center of attention there. Meanwhile, her parents are worried about their missing child and are searching for her everywhere. Finally, they learn where Geethu is and come to the village to retrieve her. Geethu also falls into the river — the same way Nandan's niece drowned — but is rescued by Nandan. The tension and anxiety unite her parents and they decide to live together again.
