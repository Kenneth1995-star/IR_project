Sri Manjunatha

Manjunatha (Arjun Sarja) is an atheist, but a good person helping others in need and fighting evil and so even though Manjunatha hates his namesake Lord Manjunatha (Chiranjeevi), the latter loves his would be devotee. Being an atheist, Manjunatha always scolds Lord Shiva which is watched by his Maha Vahanam Shri Nandi (Dwarakish) and Bhrungi (Mimicry Dayanand). Manjunatha meets Katyayini (Soundarya) a to-become devadasi and marries her. Soon they beget a son, Siddhartha ("Siddhu"), who like his mother is a staunch devotee of Lord Manjunatha.
After marriage Manjunatha realises the existence of the Supreme and slowly transforms himself into a great devotee of Lord Manjunatha and with his devotion, wins the hearts of everybody including the local King, Ambikeswara Maharaju (Ambareesh) who invites him to his court where he felicitates Manjunatha much to Manjunatha's dislike where the king realises that Manjunatha is going to die.
In the meantime Manjunatha starts a Koti Lingam Puja. Manjunatha is also troubled by his enemies and is aided by Lord Manjunatha who comes in various disguises to save his devotee and help him and his wife attain salvation.
