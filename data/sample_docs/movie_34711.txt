Enemies In-Law

Park Young-hee is a former national fencing athlete and currently a detective in the narcotics department. She also comes from a family of cops, from her soon-to-retire father to her siblings and their spouses. Han Chul-soo is the only son of two notorious criminals; his father steals cultural objects while his mother specializes in document forgery.
Chul-soo and Young-hee fall in love, but when the couple declares their intention to get married, both families disapprove. To placate Young-hee's father, Chul-soo promises that he will pass the police officer exam and become a detective like her. He spends the next seven years studying and preparing for the exam, with Young-hee by his side as supportive girlfriend.
As the exam date nears, Chul-soo's parents resort to desperate measures to sabotage the wedding and his future in the police force. Meanwhile, Young-hee and her family are ordered to investigate a serial murder case, and using his parents' expertise, Chul-soo helps with the case.
