Rudy, played by Christian Sugiono, is married to superstar celebrity Wulan, played by Titi Kamal, must keep the marriage a secret because of a clause in Wulan's contract stating that she can't get married. He then gets a job in a company (why and what company isnâ€™t really explained) and accidentally lets it slip that he is married. When his boss (Hans Isaac) wants to meet his wife, all the trouble starts. He hires a woman (Natasha Hudson) to play his pretend wife and things slowly get out of hand.
