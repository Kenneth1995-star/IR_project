Hantu Gangster

In a small town located in Klang, a rogue named Te Sai (Namewee) steals a ring during a gangster's memorial ceremony, not knowing that it is haunted. The ring hosts the ghosts of three former gang leaders who begin to haunt Te Sai as he is carrying their ring. Te Sai soon finds out that the trio were killed by a traitor whose personal agenda threatens the very foundation of unity between the three gangs. Guided by the ghosts, Te Sai must now do what he can to unify the gangs and avoid a tragedy that may result in the deaths of many innocents.
