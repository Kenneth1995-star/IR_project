Bikram Singha

Gupi (Prosenjit Chatterjee) is a small-time conman in love with Madhu (Richa Gangopadhyay), a pretty woman whom he met at a wedding he wasn't invited to. Into this picture world enters six-year-old Osmita (Baby Titli), who inexplicably believes Gupi to be her dad. And if this wasn't bad enough, Gupi becomes the object of a series of life-threatening attacks by a gang of criminals who seem to know something he doesn't.
While trying desperately to save his life and love, Gupi stumbles upon a deadly secret. A secret that will take him to a small town named Debgarh: A town terrorized by its ruthless MLA and the mafia he controls; a town whose inhabitants' only hope for redemption is Gupi.
Later he learns that ACP Bikram Singha Roy (Prosenjit Chatterjee), his look alike, is in danger from criminals.
