Haisiyat

Ram is a sincere and hardworking young man in a mill located in Bombay, India. He is the mill's union leader as well, and attempts to get a good deal for all the workers from the mill management, and succeeds. In this process, he meets the mill's new owner, Sita, and both fall in love with each other, and eventually get married. Soon there are conflicts between the management and the workers, and Ram must decide if his duty is first to his "management" wife or to his union and the workers.
