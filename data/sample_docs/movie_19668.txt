The Cracksman

Charlie Drake plays honest locksmith Ernest Wright whose problem is that he cannot resist the challenge of a lock. First he is duped by a debonair con man into opening a car. He is caught by the police but is released on probation. Next the same man fools him into breaking into a house, and he lands in jail for a year. When he is released, he gets tricked into opening a safe, for which he receives a three-year jail sentence and an undeserved reputation as a master thief. Upon his release he finds himself as a pawn being manipulated by two gangs into a safe-cracking scheme but, with the help of undercover police woman Muriel played by Nyree Dawn Porter, he helps trap the crooks and clear his name.
Portions of the film satirise the 1962 films Birdman of Alcatraz and Dr. No, Drake's hit song My Boomerang Won't Come Back as well as the Ceremony of the Keys at the Tower of London.
