Not Now, Darling

Gilbert Bodley (Leslie Phillips) plans to sell an expensive mink to mobster Harry McMichaell (Derren Nesbitt), dirt cheap, for his wife Janie (Julie Ege). Janie is Gilbert's mistress, and Gilbert wants to "close the deal." However, instead of doing his own dirty work, he gets his reluctant partner Arnold Crouch (Ray Cooney) to do it for him. Things go awry when Harry plans to buy the same coat for his own mistress, Sue Lawson (Barbara Windsor), and the whole plan fails.
