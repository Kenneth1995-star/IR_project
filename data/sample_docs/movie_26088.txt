Ehsaas: The Feeling

After the death of his wife, Aditi, Ravi Naik (Sunil Shetty) must look after his only child - a son - on his own. He brings up his son, Rohan (Mayank Tandon), in a very strict and disciplined atmosphere, so much so that his son starts to resent him and his mannerism. His immediate neighbors, Antra Pandit (Shabana Raza) and her mom (Kirron Kher) too are critical of the way Ravi handles his son, and suggest that he adapt a more lenient view. But Ravi ignores this advise. All he wants is to get Rohan excel as an athlete and win the forthcoming athletics event.
