A clotheswashgirl finds a hand in a creek where she was washing clothes. She and other clotheswashmen nearby gather together and summon the police. After an investigation, the police find various parts of this body, and determine it to be that of a young woman. They do not succeed in finding the head of the corpse, and a check with missing persons produces negative results. When Inspector Pyare Mohan, who was assigned to this investigation, receives a threat by an anonymous caller on the phone, he recommends that this file be closed. Then additional evidence surfaces, and the case is turned over to CBI Office Jasraj Patel, who along with his assistant, Gangaram, arrive to take over this investigation. They find out that the corpse is indeed of a young woman, Roshni Choubey. Roshni comes from a poor family of four unmarried sisters. Roshni seemed to be involved with several men of Army Hospital, including Dr. Kamal Dogra (Ashutosh Rana), Mohan Multani (Aditya Pancholi), Captain Ajit Verma (Milind Soman) and Bishen Nanda (Akhilendra Mishra) - all of who have a motive for killing her and disposing off her body. Who is the real killer - is the challenge that now faces Jasraj, apart from the telephonic threat that he too has received from the anonymous caller. Patel delves into the case even more deeply, putting his life at risk as the killer is constantly trying to bump him off. Eventually, Patel concludes that Roshni might not be killed by any of the men she was involved with.
In the end, it is revealed that Bishen Nanda has killed Roshni as she becomes the object of his lust. Jasraj Patel finally succeeds in nabbing Roshni's murderer and putting him behind bars.
