Sasha's personal life is different: he is married, but he is no longer attracted to his wife Vera. The passion is gone and only memories remain. Every day Sasha meets various women, with some he has short-term romantic relationships. And his wife Vera continues to hope that one day her and Sasha's life will change for the better.
And then one day Sasha meets an old friend who returned from abroad in order to occupy a major political post. Guryev suddenly realizes that he himself has dug up compromising evidence on his own friend. He begins to understand that his friend is in danger. Now there is only one way out â€“ to run for as long as it is possible, so that at least he can save himself.
