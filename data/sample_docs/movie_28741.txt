Punha Gondhal Punha Mujra

The story of this film revolves around two politicians from the same village. One of them is an elected MLA from Village constituency Narayan Wagh (Makarand Anaspure) and the other being his opponent Vishwasrao Tope(Sayaji Shinde), who has lost the election to Mr. Wagh by a narrow margin. But, Vishwasrao manages to get this nomination as MLC. So, to prove their supremacy, they indulge themselves in dirty politics, so as to turn the tables on each other. And, this clearly goes on to show how murky the politics is at the village level.
