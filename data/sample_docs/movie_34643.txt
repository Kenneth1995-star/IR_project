Another Promise

Shortly after graduating from high school, Yoon-mi begins looking for a job in order to earn money to help support her struggling family; she especially wants to pay for her younger brother Yoon-seok's tuition when he goes to college in the next few years. Her father Sang-gu, a taxi driver in Gangwon Province, is proud and overjoyed when Yoon-mi gets hired as a factory worker at the Jinsung semiconductor factory. But just two years later he learns that his daughter has been diagnosed with leukemia; four years after her diagnosis, Yoon-mi dies in the backseat of Sang-gu's cab. After learning that a number of Yoon-mi's coworkers at the factory are also suffering unlikely diseases, Sang-gu is convinced that Jinsung is responsible for his late daughter's disease and death. He makes a visit to a labor attorney to file a claim against the most powerful conglomerate in the country. Sang-gu and his family, along with their attorney and other families of leukemia patients, are soon shaken up as the company uses different methods of appeasement and pressure to keep the families from uniting, among them offering money to keep the issue from becoming public. Jinsung workers also spy on the families of the plaintiffs, stalk them and threaten them, all for the sake of their company, which they genuinely believe to be in the right. People become reluctant to be a witness for trial, either because of their loyalty to the company or for the well being of their families. But Sang-gu is determined to continue in his quest for truth and justice.
