Samaantar

Keshav Vaze (Amol Palekar) is an eminent businessman who has grown into an industrialist struggling through his life and rising from a small village. He is separated from his college sweetheart Shama (Sharmila Tagore) due to an earthquake in which he loses his family and is left to take care of several young siblings, cousins. Shama is bearing a child of Keshav and goes into a state of shock and dismay when he does not return for months. When Keshav returns, he does not find Shama where he left her and assumes she is dead after a few years. At his 60th birthday, a glimpse of Shama strikes him of how he and his yesteryear soulmate have walked on different and parallel ways.
