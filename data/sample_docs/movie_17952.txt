 Three Summers

The film's main plotline revolves around a blossoming romance between its two leads, pretentious theremin player Roland (Robert Sheehan) and down-to-earth pub band fiddler Keevy (Rebecca Breeds)
The film also had a subplot about a racist bigot (played by Michael Caton) meeting a refugee boy and a group of indigenous folk dancers and learns the error of his ways.
The film contains several running gags, revolving around feminist singer Diamond and her renditions of classic Australian songs and poems and a stern security guard who upholds the rules.
