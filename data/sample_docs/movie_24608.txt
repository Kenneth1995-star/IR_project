Sanjh Aur Savera

Dr. Shankar Chaudhry, a wealthy doctor who resides in Bombay with his younger sister, Manju, and his widowed mother, Rukmimi, finds that his mother has arranged a marriage for him with advocate Madhusudan's daughter, Maya. He concedes to the marriage, even though neither he nor his mother have met her. During the ceremony, Maya faints and recuperates under the care of her cousin, brother Prakash, and Madhusudan, and then the following day accompanies Shankar to his home. Maya rejects Shankar's sexual advances, as she is participating in a Holy Fast.
On a visit to Banaras, where Madhusudan now resides, Shankar remarries Maya at Bhagwan Vishwanath's Temple. Their relationship becomes intimate and she becomes pregnant.
Shankar arrives home one day and discovers that Prakash and Maya are missing; his search for them proves fruitless. He later learns that his wife is an imposter and that she is probably married to Prakash.
