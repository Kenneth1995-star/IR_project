Polis Evo

An old drug trafficker identified as one Adli Hashim (Wan Hanafi Su) is found dead in a back alley in Kuala Terengganu with hidden drug contraband. Inspector Khai (Shaheizy Sam), the best narcotic inspector in Kuala Lumpur has been assigned to investigate the circumstances surrounding it. The case eventually leads towards a cocaine drug trafficking operation somewhere in the state of Terengganu. Although this case is similar to cases handled by Inspector Khai before, he now has to work with Inspector Sani (Zizan Razak); who is more familiar with the intricacies of the state, being his home town. They both have different personalities; Inspector Khai is firm and swift in action, in contrast to Inspector Sani, who is more stoic and prefers to stick to procedures and protocols. Their differences further complicate their mission. Everything changes when the chief criminal, Izrail, begins to involve Inspector Sani's family in the case. Inspector Sani and Khai learn to work together to complete their mission.
