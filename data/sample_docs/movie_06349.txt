The Marauders

Avery, who wears a Confederate Army uniform even though he didn't serve in the Civil War, demands that the men who work for rancher John Rutherford avenge him after Rutherford is killed trying to remove a squatter from his land, Corey Everett.
A passing family, the Ferbers, are traveling by wagon. They meet Corey, who explains that he is homesteading, not squatting, and entitled to the property. Corey defended himself alone with dynamite after Rutherford's men attacked, but Avery became convinced that Corey had many men fighting by his side. He insists his men, led by ranch foreman Hook, call him "General" and obey his orders to launch another attack.
Hannah Ferber doesn't trust Corey at all. Her husband Louis is taken captive by Avery, who tortures and kills him, refusing to believe the truth that Corey is alone. Avery's men realize he is insane and intend to leave, so Avery destroys their water supply. Corey's water is now the only one within hundreds of miles.
Hannah shoots Corey in the shoulder and flees with her son, but returns to nurse him back to health after Louis's body is found. Together they stave off Avery, whose men desert him. Avery dies, astounded to learn that Corey had no other men fighting with him.
