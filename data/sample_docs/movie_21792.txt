Paradise

In 1823, during the Georgian era, teenagers, David and Sarah, travel with a caravan from Baghdad to Damascus. At an oasis, a white slaver known as 'the Jackal' raids the party and attempts to add the beautiful young Sarah to his harem. David and Sarah and her servant, Geoffrey, narrowly escape, but all the others are slain in a massacre including David's American missionary parents. When Geoffrey seeks help at an encampment controlled by the Jackal, he is killed.
David and Sarah rest at a nearby enclave as they head west toward civilization. Their flight leads them to a beautiful oasis—a Paradise—where they discover love and sex. However, the Jackal does not give up hope of capturing Sarah, so David must lure him to his death. At the conclusion, Sarah reveals to David that she is pregnant and the two young lovers finally reach civilization, the city of Damascus.
