The Learning Tree

Newt Winger, Marcus Savage, and several of their friends steal apples from Jake Kiner's orchard, and when Kiner confronts the boys, he is beaten and left for dead by Marcus, who is later sent to jail for his actions. While Marcus is in jail, Newt begins to work for Kiner to make up for his actions and those of his friends, and also begins a relationship with the new girl in town Arcella Jefferson, but his relationship with her is ultimately destroyed when Chauncey Cavanaugh, a white man and son of the local judge, rapes and impregnates Arcella, who ultimately moves away out of shame. Another scene scene also shows Newt forced into a brutal boxing match at the County fair.
One day when Newt is eating his lunch in the loft of Kiner's barn, he witnesses the brutal attack and murder of Kiner by Booker Savage, Marcus' father. Newt initially keeps quiet about what he has seen, but appears to be bothered that Silas Newhall, who was at the scene of the crime for another reason, is being accused for a murder he did not commit. Encouraged by his mother Sarah, Newt reveals to Judge Cavanaugh that Booker committed the murder, and also testifies in court, but rather than doing the good he intended it to do, Newt's testimony leads to the suicide of Booker and almost being killed by Marcus.
Through all this, the film is able to capture "an adolescent boy's initiation in sex, love, death, justice and injustice, and, because he is black, a fair measure of racial hatred" in "a profoundly nostalgic way", according to New York Times movie reviewer, Roger Greenspun.[2]
