Alli Thandha Vaanam

Satyam (Prabhu Deva) is the carefree son of businessman, owner of Satyam mills Lakshmipathi (Moulee). Disappointed Lakshmipathi asks Satyam to spend three months alone on the streets of Chennai to learn the value of money. He would have no money and could not use the information of who he is and his education (paid by his father) to gain favour or make a living from anyone.
So Satyam sets out and from the very start, meets Divya (Laila), who plays an overexuberant youth girl, who cries or laughs constantly. In the next frame, he saves Meenakshi 'Meena' (Neha) in the style of MGR from would-be rapists, and in the third, he meets Julie (Kalyani), they both take each other as sibblings. Satyam promises Julie that he will help find her mother. Together they set out on a journey in search of her mum and to make a living (to survive to meet daily need; food, shelter and medicine). Julie has her own sad story which sounds equivalent to the far better film Kutty. He sees Meenakshi again, and the two of them fall in love.
Julie and Satyam steal a suitcase from Madhavan (Murali) but later that night find out it is full of medicine. Without his medicine, Madhavan falls unconscious. Satyam goes to return the medicine and finds him unconscious. He then takes him to the hospital and learns he is going to need â‚¹ 5 lakhs to save him as he almost inadvertently killed.
So Satyam enters the house of billionaire (Rajeev) Divya's father, pretending to be his long-lost son Madhavan. Prakash (Prakash Raj), Satyam's cousin (as a villain) sets out to kill Satyam, who is after his uncle Lakshmipathi money.[1]
