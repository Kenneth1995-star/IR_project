Ethir Neechal

Maadhu is a destitute orphan who performs odd jobs in a multi-family tenancy for his living and education. For the services he renders, he's allowed to sleep under the stairs of the tenancy without any rent. He attends college with the help from one of his college professor and kind people that share roof in that tenancy he lives. Among few people who understand his situation, and are ready to help are Sabapathy and Nair. He overhears one of the tenants speaking to her husband of getting him married to their daughter Paru who is said to be psychologically challenged. He forcefully makes his mind to love their daughter even before they propose a marriage, so as to calm himself that the girl is none other than the girl he loved and not some unknown psychologically challenged girl. How she proves that she's indeed a normal person and also helps Maadhu to prove his worth forms the rest of the plot.
