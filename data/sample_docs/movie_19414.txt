The Spaniard's Curse

Guy Stevenson (Basil Dignam) is a British man of Spanish heritage wrongly convicted of murder. On being given the death sentence, he places a curse on the judge (Michael Hordern) and jury. Two of the jurors then die mysteriously, and suspicion falls on Stevenson, but he himself also dies. The judge and his daughter Margaret attempt to solve the mystery and uncover the real killer.
