Padikkadavan

Rajasekhar (Sivaji Ganesan) is the loving elder stepbrother of Rajendran (Rajinikanth) and Ramu (Vijaybabu). After his marriage, his wife (Vadivukkarasi) sends his brothers out when he goes to Chennai. Rajendran, the older of the two, toils and becomes a taxi driver to educate and bring up his brother, but his brother strays and gets mixed up with some wrong-doers. He marries a girl Manju (Ramya Krishnan) from a rich family. The girl's uncle (Jaishankar), is a smuggler who sells drugs using his older brother's lorries. Jaishankar later kills his brother and puts the blame on Rajendran. Rajasekhar, the presiding judge, realizes that Rajendran is his long-lost brother and returns as a lawyer to save him.
