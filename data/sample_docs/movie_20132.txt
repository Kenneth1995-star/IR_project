Innocent Bystanders

John Craig (Baker) is an aging British secret agent who is tasked with returning a defector, the Russian scientist Kaplan (Sheybal) who has foregone science for a modest life as a goatherd in Turkey. Craig faces opposition from his boss, his younger replacements, an American secret agent, a Turkish hotel keeper, and an organization of Russian Jews hostile to Kaplan. Craig's mission is complicated by Miriam (Chaplin), an innocent bystander who is taken hostage.[3]
