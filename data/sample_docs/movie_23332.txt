Royal Tramp

The story of Wai Siu-bo, a lecherous wimp who after saving Chan, the leader of the Heaven and Earth society, a revolutionary group, is made a member. After a botched first assignment for the group, he is made a servant to the Emperor, the very person the Heaven and Earth society wants to overthrow. What follows is plenty of mayhem and laughter. But it ends with the exposure and escape of the fake Empress Dowager.
