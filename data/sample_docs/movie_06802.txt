Hit and Run

Gus Hilmer, a moneyed garage and junkyard owner, falls in love with and marries a showgirl named Julie, who's many years younger than he, and this causes tension between Hilmer and Frankie, a young auto mechanic whom he has befriended.
Julie begins a romantic affair with Frankie, then plots with him to get rid of her husband. On a dark, remote road, Frankie runs down Gus with a car, killing him. He and Julie are free to be together and run the garage, or at least they think they are until Gus's twin brother turns up.
