The Suicide Forecast

Baseball player-turned-insurance salesman Byung-woo (Ryoo Seung-bum) is seen as the cocky ace of his company until one of his clients commits suicide. The police suspect him of aiding and abetting the suicide, which almost jeopardizes Byung-woo's career. Anxious to ensure it won't happen again, he gets in touch with his previous clients. Particularly those who seem the type to commit suicide.
During his quest to turn their lives around for the better, Byung-woo reunites with a lonely husband (Park Chul-min), a debt-ridden lounge singer (Younha), a homeless young man (Im Joo-hwan), and a widowed mother (Jung Sun-kyung).[2][3]
