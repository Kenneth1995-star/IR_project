Double Exposures

Reporter Peter Bradfield (Basil Langton) is fired from his newspaper for failing to deliver an interview with big businessman Hector Rodman (Julien Mitchell). Plucky Bradfield subsequently becomes a photographic equipment salesman, and accidentally takes photos of two men in conversation. Unbeknown to him, these men are the businessmen's lawyer and his secretary, and are plotting to embezzle a fortune in bonds from Rodman, and planning to frame his workshy son George (George Astley) for the crime.
