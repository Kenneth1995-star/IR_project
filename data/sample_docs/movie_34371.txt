Madame Aema 6

In this entry in the long-running Madame Aema series, three Aemas are represented: a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth generation of women bearing the name Madame Aema. The fourth generation Aema lives on Jeju Island with her daughter and memories of unrequited love. The fifth generation tries to console the fourth generation Aema, while dealing with her own issues of isolation after declaring herself an independent woman. Sixth generation Aema is undergoing marital difficulties with an unfaithful husband whom she eventually divorces.[3]
