Heat Team

Lee Yiu-ting (Aaron Kwok) and Wong Kai-chung (Eason Chan) are police officers of the Regional Crime Unit of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon respectively. Both of them are ace marksmen, as well as being very agile. They are elite members of the police force who have never met.
Regional Crime Unit Superintendent Cheung Tit-chu (Danny Lee) had received information that international thief Ken Ma (Wong Ban-yuen) has secretly entered Hong Kong for a heist. Superintendent Cheung decides to organize a special operation group with elite members of the police force to take down international criminals, and Chung and Ting were recruited to the group.
Ken plans to lead his gang in a heist to steal a priceless diamond necklace. Ken and his girlfriend To Yu-fung (Victoria Wu), a jewelry appraiser, plan to retire after the heist and leave to distant parts. Ting, Chung, alongside their new female superior Fung Po-po (Yumiko Cheng) work together to investigate the whereabouts of the stolen necklace. However, the three of them do not trust each other and cause many disputes while competing for the best performance. While on the thread-less occasion, Yu-fung appears and makes a deal with the police that she will hand out the necklace if they would find and rescue Ken. At this time, Yu-fung is also being hunted by gangsters. To ensure her safety, Ting and Chung were assigned to protect Yu-fung. Since then, the relationship between them have turned from hostile to delicate and sensitive. The movie ends with Ting leaving the hospital ward after visiting Chung to recuperate from his gun shot injury.
