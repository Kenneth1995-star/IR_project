Mob boss Kaalkeshwar Singh (Amrish Puri) has an issue with a fellow mobster who wants to expand his own sphere of influence. During a confrontation, Albert (Deepak Shirke) attempts to shoot Kaalkeshwar, but due to the intervention of Arjun (Sunil Shetty), Albert is himself killed. Appreciative, Kaalkeshwar asks Arjun to spend some time on his estate out of town. He learns that Arjun's girlfriend, Maria (Ritu Shivpuri), had had then killed herself out of shame after having been molested by Albert. Her death has been now avenged. Kaalkeshwar introduces Ajun to his subdued and submissive wife, Monica (Monica Bedi). Unknown to Ajun, Kaalkeshwar is extremely jealous, and had even killed a man for simply shaking her hand and complimenting her. His anger is unimaginable when he learned that his house guest Ajun and his wife Monica have begun an affair.
