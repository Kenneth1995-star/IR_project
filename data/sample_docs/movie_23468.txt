Troublesome Night 8

Bud Pit and his family leave the city and move to the countryside. While moving in, Bud Pit accidentally knocks over a small incense stick holder and is disturbed by a spirit for a while. He is also attracted to his new, cheerful neighbour Olive. He becomes suspicious of her when he sees her roaming the streets at night, not recognising him and behaving like a completely different person. He tells his mother, the expert ghostbuster Mrs Bud Lung, and she unravels the mystery. They learn that Olive has been possessed by a ghost who is looking for her lost son. Mrs Bud Lung promises to help the ghost reunite with her (also deceased) son on the condition that she leaves Olive's body after the reunion.
