The Prenup

Wendy (Jennylyn Mercado) is a woman who goes to the United States to meet her biological father. On board the plane, she meets Sean (Sam Milby). Wendy and Sean initially have a cat-dog relationship but they eventually warm up to each other. When her biological father fails to accommodate her, Sean invites Wendy to stay in his apartment. They fall in love with each other and decide to get married.
However, when they return to the Philippines, they become frustrated when their families don't get along. The rich guy's parents (Jaclyn Jose and Freddie Webb) insist that Wendy sign a prenuptial agreement. Their lives become even more complicated when Wendy's parents (Dominic Ochoa and Gardo Versoza) add their own clauses to the prenup.
