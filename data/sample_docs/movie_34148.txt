The Sovereign's Servant

The action takes place at the time of the Swedish-Russian war of 1709. The King of France, Louis XIV, sends two duelists into exile: Antoine De La Bouche (Valery Malikov) is ordered to go to the camp of the King, Charles XII, of the Swedes and Charles de Brézé (Dmitry Miller) is sent to the camp of the Russian Tsar, Peter the First. Both Frenchmen face various dangers along their way. They witness the grand battle of Poltava from opposite sides. Court plots and romantic adventures stay in the past as both our milksops are plunged head first in the boiling pot of war and the horrors it brings into their lives, until they face on the Battle of Poltava.[1]
After a duel, Charles is killed in the duel by De La Bouche. Then, Tsar Peter I asks Bouche about why he was exiled to Russia. He just wonders back to the past, where he and Charles prepared to be exiled. The last scene sets back to the past, when both went to Russia.
