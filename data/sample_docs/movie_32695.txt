Murali (Posani Krishna Murali) and his wife, Lakshmi Devi (Revathi) are a married couple who are deeply in love and the parents of Raja (Varun Tej). Murali demands money from his mother and father-in-law, Lakshmi Devi's parents, which prompts Lakshmi Devi to separate from him. Murali steals their son Raja from his mother, Lakshmi Devi, and takes him to Jodhpur where they live as grifters. A girl, Parijatam (Disha Patani) arrives in Jodhpur while escaping from an unwanted marriage proposal. Raja and Parijatam fall in love with one another, which causes Murali to reveal Parijatam's location to her family.[6]
