Paper Marriage

Set in the United States, a down-on-his-luck Chinese boxer named Bo Chin (Sammo Hung) accepts promise of payment to marry a Hong Kong woman named Jade Lee (Maggie Cheung) so she can get American citizenship. They realize too late that they have been set up in a complicated plan to cheat them out of the woman's money. Their adventures begin when Bo is forced back into the ring and Maggie tries her hand at mud-wrestling.
