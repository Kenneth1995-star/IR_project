Deadfall

After con artist Joe Dolan (Michael Biehn) accidentally kills his father Mike (James Coburn) during a sting, he tries to carry out Mike's dying wish by recovering valuables that Mike's twin brother Lou (also played by Coburn) stole from him years earlier. But Uncle Lou is also a con artist, and Joe is soon drawn into his increasingly dangerous schemes.
