There's a Girl in My Soup

Sellers appears as Robert Danvers, a vain, womanizing and wealthy host of a high-profile cooking show. He meets Hawn's character, a no-nonsense American hippie living with an English rock musician in London, and, to everyone's surprise, falls for her while she's on the outs with her boy friend.
She moves in with him, and accompanies him on a trip to a wine festival in France. Meanwhile, her rock musician boyfriend decides he wants her back.
Sellers' character's catchphrase is: "My God, but you're lovely"â€”which he sometimes says to his own reflection.[5]
