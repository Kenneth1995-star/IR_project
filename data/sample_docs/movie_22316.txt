Gabrielle

In Montreal, Gabrielle is a 22-year-old woman with Williams syndrome and diabetes, handling her own insulin injections but not living independently. She is a member of The Muses of Montreal, a musical choir for people with disabilities, at the Recreational Centre, and meets a fellow singer named Martin, with whom she develops a relationship. Her sister, Sophie, is attempting to arrange travel to meet with her boyfriend in India, but is unwilling to leave Gabrielle behind. One night, Gabrielle and Martin are caught engaging in sexual conduct publicly in the Centre. Sophie and Martin's mother are called to the Centre to address the matter. Sophie defends Gabrielle and Martin's right to have sex in private, as they are in love and she feels they should be able to, as adults. Sophie also asserts Gabrielle has been educated in safe sex. Martin's mother is angry at the notion, saying Martin is a virgin and that sex is different for people with disabilities. Gabrielle and Martin no longer see each other at the Centre.
Gabrielle expresses frustration with her lack of autonomy to Sophie. Sophie wishes to see proof Gabrielle can live autonomously, warning her that having her own apartment will not bring Martin back. Gabrielle spends a day alone in the apartment, setting off the fire alarm with burnt toast, but when Sophie returns she is more concerned to see how Gabrielle has handled her diabetes. At the Centre, Gabrielle mourns Martin's absence while The Muses prepare for a concert with Robert Charlebois. Sophie is finally persuaded to travel to India, though this means she will miss the concert. On the day of the concert, Martin and Gabrielle have sex before performing.
