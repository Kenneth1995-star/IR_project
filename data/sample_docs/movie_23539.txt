Yesterday Once More

Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng star as Mr. and Mrs. Thief, a husband and wife team of super-thieves. After a successful diamond robbery, the two get into an argument about how the loot should be split up and the husband leaves.
Two years later, Mrs Thief is on the verge of remarrying although her affections lie more with the expensive necklace belonging to her fiance's mother-in-law than with the husband to be. When a plot to steal the necklace ends up falling into the hands of Mr. Thief, the couple are forced together again.
