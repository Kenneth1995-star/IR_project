Swagatham

Shailu (Anushka Shetty) is an unmarried, ill-tempered businesswoman living in the United States. She tries to care for her mother and young nephew, and manage her bills. KK (Jagapati Babu), with his young daughter, opens a shop across the street from her. This helps her find a new perspective on her life. Shailu falls in love with KK, but when she declares her feelings for him she learns that he already has a wife, Vidya (Bhumika Chawla). In a flashback, the film relates the romance of KK and Vidya. In the past, KK was an abrasive businessman when he sought a mate at Jalaja Rao Marriage Bureau. Instead, he winds up courting and marrying Vidya, an employee. KK's dilemma is simplified by the fact that one of the women in his life is dying from chronic leukemia.
