Across the Line

The film is set in North Preston, Nova Scotia where Mattie (Stephan James), a black hockey player, is being considered for a professional career. However, his hopes are threatened by growing racial strife at his school while his brother Carter (Shamier Anderson) is involved in criminal activity. Mattie also has a romantic interest in Jayme (Sarah Jeffery) who already has a white boyfriend.[2]
The film's storyline was inspired by the 1989 Cole Harbour District High School race riots.[3]
