Damaad

Sharad (Amol Palekar) belongs to a middle-class family and lives with his brother and sister-in-law. Sharad gets a job in Malavli in which he is not interested. He, however, does go for the job where he meets Mr. Rodrigues and Mr. Choudhury, who are initially rude to him, but afterwards mellow down. Both these men are on the look-out for grooms for their daughters. On the first day, Sharad's boss takes him to his house for lunch where he is introduced to Heena, the Boss' daughter who falls in love with him. Then, he gets introduced to Mr. Rodrigues' daughter too. But Sharad is in love with Renu (Ranjeeta Kaur), his neighbour. In the factory, his assistant Mr. Kote (Ashok Saraf) wants to help him get out of the trap created by Mr. Chaudhury and Mr. Rodrigues. Kote spreads the rumour that Sharad is not of chaste character. This, however, creates tensions between Renu and Sharad. Mr. Chaudhury starts believing that Kote is spreading the rumours in order to win the place of his son-in-law. At this juncture, Sharad introduces Renu to all of them and all tensions are resolved.
