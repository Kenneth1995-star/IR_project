A Gun Fightin' Gentleman

As described in a film magazine,[2] ranch owner Cheyenne Harry (Carey) is the victim of a plot engineered by land speculator John Merritt (Sherry), who uses a doctored title to deprive Harry of his land holdings. Powerless in the face of his opponent's superior knowledge of the law, Harry is forced to retaliate by appropriating Merritt's payroll. Later he abducts Merritt's daughter Helen (O'Connor) and holds her pending settlement of their dispute. A settlement is effected in due time, but not before Harry has won the heart of the young woman.
