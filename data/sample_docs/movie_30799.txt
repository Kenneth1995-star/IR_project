Pasupathy (Ranjith) lives with his mother in a village and comes to town with the intent of finding a job. He fights against a few thugs and hands them over to a police constable Daas (Vivek) following which Daas gets promoted as sub inspector. Pasupathy accompanies Das and his team most of the time. Pasupathyâ€™s mother is diagnosed with a heart problem and he is need of Rs.5 lakhs for the surgery. Pasupathy tries hard to collect money with the help of Das and Priya (Sindhu Tolani) but in vain.
Pasupthy gets in touch with a naxal group which promises to pay him the required money if he surrenders to the police instead of the wanted naxal. Pasupathy agrees and surrenders but the money does not reach him as the naxal (Ilavarasu) who was supposed to pay the money had other problems. Finally the naxal group decides to save Pasupathy by surrendering themselves and also give the money needed for operation. But they get cheated by the assistant commissioner who does not hand over the money to Pasupathi.
Finally Pasupathi is proved to be innocent and is released from jail. He also gets the required money with the help of Daas and Priya. The surgery is performed but is unsuccessful as his mother goes unconscious post-surgery. Pasupathy gets heart broken and cries at the feet of his mother in the hospital. Suddenly his mother gets conscious and wakes up but Pasupathy dies in the feet of his mother.
