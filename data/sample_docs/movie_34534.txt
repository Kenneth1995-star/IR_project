Never Ending Story

Oh Song-kyung (Jung Ryeo-won) is a well-organized 28-year-old bank teller. She meticulously has a plan for everything, including getting married through a dating agency. Taekwondo master Kang Dong-joo's (Uhm Tae-woong) biggest pleasure is buying lottery tickets in hopes of one day hitting the jackpot. In reality, however, he's an incompetent young man who barely makes ends meet and mooches off his younger brother (Park Ki-woong). He is forced to register with a dating agency because of pressure from his sister-in-law (Yoo Sun), who wants to kick him out of their house.
They are the polar opposites of each other, but a few days after registering with the agency, they meet at a hospital where they have both been diagnosed with brain cancer and given just three months to live. When their doctor's appointments bring them into regular contact, the two fall in love and decide to live their remaining days together. With time running out, together they prepare for the last ceremonies of their lives: their funeral, by shopping for coffins, urns and burial clothes and chambers, as well as wedding plans.[3][4]
