Jaganmohini

Raja (Narasimha Raju) was a king in his previous life. When he went to forest once to hunt animals he gets attracted to an orphan sticks selling lady Mohini (Jayamalini) and lusts after her. He seduces her and enjoys having sex with her in the forest. After a week he leaves her in the forest itself promising that he would return to marry her and will make his queen. But Raja is a lustful womanizer and he just betrayed Mohini. Knowing this Mohini commits suicide oathing that she will return to get him in his next life. Raja in his next birth goes to the same forest to drink water where Jaganmohini now a ghost appears to him and lures him with her beauty. But parallelly he is married to other pious woman (Prabha). She regains him by praying her Goddess, whom she believes strongly. She is helped by a Monkey and Snake. Jagan Mohini at last gets her "motcham" and goes heaven.
