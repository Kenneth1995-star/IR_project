Athithi

Madhiazhagan (Nandha) is a highly successful project manager at a leading property promoters firm. He's happily wedded to Vasugi (Ananya) and has a five-year-old daughter Pavi. Posh house, heftily paying job, highly appreciative and supportive boss, and a happy family - Madhi's life is a far fetched dream to most people in this era. But all changes one day, when a man requests to be dropped en route, when Madhi and Vasu set out on a pleasant weekend. The mysterious stranger pulls out a pistol and begins to threaten the couple to bend to his wishes, holding Pavi as hostage. And the day sets off with the stranger making the couple draw out all the money Madhi has, to the last penny and setting it all on fire. Next, he makes Madhi lose his career by leaking the top secrets of his company, trusted to him, to their competitor. And the day goes on with further more gimmicks by the stranger, while the couple are cornered to do it all for their little daughter's life. And for the same reason, they also refrain from making a complaint to the police, although they are tantalizingly near their target. While this seems endless, how they figure a way out of the mess, with a completely unexpected twist to the whole story in the end, 'Athithi' is an edge-of-the-seat realistic thriller.
