A Hobo's Christmas

After abandoning his family in Salt Lake City 25 years prior, Chance (a hobo) decides it's time to go home.
Drifting from place to place, Chance finds himself in his hometown of at Christmas time. However, his son (still resenting the fact that Chance ran out on his family 25 years earlier), gives Chance only one day with his grandkids; after that, he's expected to leave and never come back. Meanwhile, Chance's friends warn him that his son and the past are memories that are best left alone, and should leave, but he has to find out for himself.
