Divya Shakti

An idealistic journalist (Ajay Devgn) gets weary and tired of witnessing the reign of crime, police corruption and injustice in his city and decides to wage a one-man war against the psychotic king maker "Tau", played by the legendary Amrish Puri. His journey costs him his limbs and loved ones as he goes on a vigilante style brute-fest right into the lair and dark world of the two-faced Tau and his cronies. Death and destruction follow the warpath.
