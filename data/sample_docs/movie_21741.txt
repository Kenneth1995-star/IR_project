Wild Horse Hank

Wild Horse Hank is the adventure of a brave young girl named Hank (Linda Blair) who is a dedicated cowgirl to saving a herd of wild mustangs from poachers. Hank is an independent girl in the film who has been around horses all her life. One day while out riding she happens upon some horse hunters who are rounding up a herd of mustangs to sell for pet food.[1]
Hank follows the hunters into town and releases the caged horses. If Hank is to save these wild animals, they must reach the protection of federal land. But the nearest such area lies across a desert, through a river and over a mountain range some 150 miles away.[2]
Pace, Hanks father (Richard Crenna), objects to her plan but finally agrees to let her go. Hank begins her adventure, herding the horses toward the Rantan Game Preserve, but the epic drive soon becomes a contest of wills with the poachers trying to outwit Hank whenever possible. In the film, Hanks love interest Charlie Connors (Michael Wincott) assists with her adventure and is eager to earn her respect and get to know her.
