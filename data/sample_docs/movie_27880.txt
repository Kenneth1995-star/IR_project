There, they find two of their colleagues killed by the dwarfs and decide to take asylum in the village's temple so they won't be found.
They later learn that all the males in that village are dwarfs as a result of a curse laid upon them by their god Gandharvan. All the ladies are 5 ft. or taller. The dwarfs are banned from entering the Gandharva temple and it is believed that if they enter the temple by force their head will break into pieces.
Mallika Kapoor, daughter of the dwarf king Jagathy Sreekumar and the princess of the island who is engaged to Guinness Pakru sees Prithviraj in the temple and believes that he is the real Gandharvan. Both of them fall in love with each other at the first sight. She helps them with food and shelter unknowing to her father and fiancée. Prithviraj and his friends secretly start building a boat for them to escape.
Pakru feels something fishy and starts watching Mallika. He even enters the Gandharvan Temple to find out the truth only to be frightened by the disguised prithviraj.

When the dwarfs are about to execute the death sentence they are attacked by Gigantic Cannibals who attack and kill most of the men. Prithviraj and his friends manage to escape and fight against the Cannibals and succeed in defeating them, thus saving the kingdom. The dwarf king forgives them and allows them to sail to their homeland with Malika Kapoor.
