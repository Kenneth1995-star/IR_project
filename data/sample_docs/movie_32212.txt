Karthik (NTR Jr.) challenges a level headed industrialist Bhanumati (Ramya Krishnan) that he would marry either of her daughters, to take revenge on her for insulting him in his interview to get a job in her company. Meghana (Shriya Saran) falls for the young man, just for the one accidental kiss he gives her. The younger one Gagana (Genelia D'Souza) too follows suit, and now Karthik has a grip over both of Bhanumati’s daughter. Competing with him is Bhanumati’s nephew (Rajiv Kanakala), whose father (Charan Raj) too encourages him to chase his cousins, and marry either of them to inherit their property. It is revealed in the flashback, that Bhanumati leaves her husband Suman, and Karthik is her nephew. How the responsible son-in-law sets his mom-in-law right and eliminates the villains from the game, is what the story is about.
