Freshman Love

Male students are tricked into joining Billings College's rowing team when the coach, Speed Hammond, is able to persuade the school president's attractive daughter, Joan Simpkins, to recruit them.
Bob Wilson is one of the rowers, but due to a problem with his grades, he ends up enrolling under a phony name. Adversaries try everything, even music, to distract the Billings crew during the big race, but the team holds on for victory.
