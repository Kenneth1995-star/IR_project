The Deal

Veteran detective Tae-soo figures out that the suspect in a hit-and-run case, Gang-chun, is a serial killer wanted for several murders. But not long after his victory, Tae-soo realizes that his younger sister Soo-kyung was Gang-chun's last victim. Gang-chun receives the death penalty, but refuses to reveal the whereabouts of the victims' bodies, leaving Tae-soo and his brother-in-law Seung-hyun devastated. Three years later, Tae-soo is investigating the murder of a gangster boss when to his surprise, he finds evidence that Seung-hyun is the prime suspect. As he digs deeper, Tae-soo learns that the gang's former boss is now in the same prison as Gang-chun, who is thriving and looking better than ever (South Korea hasn't carried out a single execution since 1997).
