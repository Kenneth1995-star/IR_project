During his childhood, Ramu (MGR) escapes from killing during the massacre of his parents. He grows up, haunted by the memory of this horrible night, drawing indefatigably a white horse, resulting from the curb chain bracelet of the mysterious killer. Later, he finds the murderer some years later on his policeman's way with the help of Usthad Abdul Rahman (MGR), (an ex-owner of cabaret), and settle the score with him.
