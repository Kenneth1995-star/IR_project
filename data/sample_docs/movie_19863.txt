A Countess from Hong Kong

Ambassador-designate to Saudi Arabia Ogden Mears (Marlon Brando) sails back to America after touring the world. He meets Natascha, a Russian countess (Sophia Loren), in Hong Kong after she sneaks aboard in evening dress to escape her life at a sailors' dance hall. A refugee, she has no passport and is forced to stay in his cabin during the voyage.
Ogden dislikes the situation, being a married man although seeking a divorce, and he worries how it might affect his career if she is found. But he reluctantly agrees to let her stay. They must then figure out how to get her off the ship, and it is arranged that she marry his aged valet Hudson (Patrick Cargill).
Although it is only a formality, Hudson wishes to consummate the relationship, a wish she does not share. She avoids him until they dock at port, then jumps off the ship and swims ashore.
Ogden's wife (Tippi Hedren) then joins the cruise, having just missed Natasha. Ogden's lawyer friend Harvey (Sydney Earle Chaplin), who helped arrange the marriage, meets Natascha ashore and tells her that the immigration officers have accepted her as Hudson's wife. Ogden's wife then confronts him about Natasha, speaking rather roughly about her and her past lifestyle. He responds by asking if his wife would have done as well under such circumstances.
The film ends with Ogden and Natascha meeting in a hotel's cabaret where they begin dancing, since he has left the cruise and his wife behind.
Charlie Chaplin makes two brief appearances as an aged ship's steward.
