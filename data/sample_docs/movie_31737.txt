Bhakta Tukaram

The movie is based on the story of Tukaram. Tukaram (ANR) is a small-time trader with two wives Avali Bai (Anjali Devi) & Rukma Bai (Jr. Sreeranjani). Tukaram is however not interested in worldly matters and is always immersed in God. He is a fervent devotee of Panduranga, whose praises he sings daily. He faces a lot of problems because of his devotion. People take advantage of his nature and cheat him. His family suffers, and his first wife Rukma dies of starvation during a famine. His family falls on hard times, and he questions the very existence of God. When he tries to commit suicide in despair, he experiences Divine Enlightenment and becomes totally devoted to God. He starts writing kirtans or Abhangs devoted to the God. This is not liked by the orthodox priests, as he belonged to a lower caste. They make him throw all his work into the Indrayani river. When the river Goddess miraculously gives him back all his work, the people of the village are convinced of his divine nature. His fame spreads to such an extent, that even the great emperor Shivaji (Sivaji) comes down to meet him.
