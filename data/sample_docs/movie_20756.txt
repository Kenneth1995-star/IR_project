Maybe Baby

Sam Bell (Laurie) and wife Lucy (Richardson) are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. At the same time, Sam begins to find his job (as a commissioning editor of drama at the BBC) increasingly unfulfilling. While he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer writer's block. The idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which Lucy objects strongly. He uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. Lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves Sam. Eventually they reconcile and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby.
It marks the second time Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson have starred in the same film - the first was 101 Dalmatians (although they shared no scenes).
