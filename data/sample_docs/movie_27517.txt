Raja Rajendra

This story is about a guy named Mani (Sharan), who also is an imposter of a dreaded goon named Bottle Mani (P. Ravi Shankar). Due to this he earns the wrath of bottle Mani. Alternatively, Neelakanta Raju (Ramakrishna), a member of a royal family is an old man with three daughters and a long last son. He hopes that his son and his grandson come to him one day, while his sons-in-law want him to die as soon as possible. To get the old man killed, the three sons-in-law along with Shastri (Suchendra Prasad) go to city and contact a guy who promises him to send Mani to act like grandson of Neelakanta Raju. Instead of the original bottle Mani, he fixes up Mani so that Mani could get his mother cured with the contract money.
Mani goes to palace and gains entry into household, but a being tender heart he fails to kill the old man, instead he saves the old man's life and gains his confidence. He also falls in love with Shastri's daughter in due course. The trio and Shastri, find out that Mani is different from Bottle Mani and try to expel him out of house. However, the spirit of Raja Rajendra who was father of Neelakanta Raju takes over Mani and teaches them lesson. Day after day, every night the spirit takes over Mani and starts expelling the enemies of family. This attracts the attention of police and Inspector Indrajith (Sadhu Kokila) comes to investigate the issue.
The trio hire a black magician to seal the spirit of Raja Rajendra in a bottle and become successful. The spirit gets released when Indrajith discards the bottle by mistake. Unknowingly, Shastri's daughter requests magician to give the spirit of RR, and he gets confused as the bottles do not have any labels. He brings along spirits of a bus conductor, kabaddi player, independence activist and drama artists.
What follows is the laughter riot in climax where all these spirits take over different people there and how Mani wins over the trio.
