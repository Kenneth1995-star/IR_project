Bullet

The film is about Durga Prasad (Kabir Bedi), owner of a shipping company, but whose main business is to cheat innocent people. He is pursued by Inspector Dharam Dev (Dev Anand). Dev is trying to nail him for his misdeeds. He befriends his personal secretary Sapna, (Parveen Babi) to meet his goal.
Initially hurt and annoyed, Sapna decides to help him when Durga Prasad urges her to please one of his associates. Dharam Dev gets hold of some confidential files of Durga Prasad, but on the way is overpowered by Durga's goons and falsely implicated in a murder case.
Dharam Dev's track record and timely help from inspector Rajesh (Rakesh Roshan) facilitates his release, after which he vows to finish Durga Prasad with a bullet he keeps exclusively for him. "Is bullet pe tumhara naam likha hai", (your name is written or carved on this bullet) Dharam Dev warns Durga Prasad. With the entry of Mala (Sonia Sahani), lover of Durga Prasad, Seth Ghanshyam Das (Shreeram Lagoo) and Roshi (Jyoti Bakshi) there is a twist in the story with suspense enveloping the narrative.
Dharam Dev is initially suspected, but later it is revealed that Durga Prasad is the murderer, with the climax shot at Bombay Hospital, where the former shoots the latter.
