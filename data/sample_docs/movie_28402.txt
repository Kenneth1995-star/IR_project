Kunjananthante Kada

The story is set in a village around the Mattannur-Iritty area of Kannur, Kerala. Kunjananthan (Mammootty) manages a provision store the village. Resigned to an unhappy marriage, it is this shop that is at the centre of his existence. The owner of the building pleads with him to vacate the shop so he may settle his debts, but Kunjananthan does not relent. Eviction, however, seems unavoidable when the government tries to acquire land for a road development project. Kunjanthan's travails to retain the shop form the second-half of the film.
