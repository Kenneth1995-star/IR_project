Indian

Raj Shekhar Azad (Sunny Deol) is an honest Deputy Commissioner of Police whose sole intention is to wipe out corruption. From his name to his aim, emerges unflinching patriotism. But for every such patriot, there is an equally motivated terrorist.
Waseem Khan (Mukesh Rishi), a dreaded terrorist, is aided in his mission by Raj's father-in-law (Raj Babbar), an influential industrialist (Danny Denzongpa) and several police officers.
Raj's path is laden with hurdles, but he leaves no stone unturned, within the realm of law, to wage a war against the evil doers. The film is notable for the Sunny Deol's portrayal DCP Azad. The sublime toughness and solidity that the acclaimed actor manages to bring to the character of Rajshekhar Azad in his trademark sedate style is the high point of the film. Raj Babbar too comes of in with a powerful performance though his role disappears within the first hour. The peerless Danny Dengzongpa, is powerful in his portrayal of Singhania Saab in the film.
