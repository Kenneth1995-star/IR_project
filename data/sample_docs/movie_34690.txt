Big Match

Choi Ik-ho (Lee Jung-jae), is a former footballer and UFC mixed martial arts star nicknamed "Zombie." When his older brother and coach Young-ho suddenly disappears, the police arrests him as the prime murder suspect. Then Ik-ho receives a phone call from Ace (Shin Ha-kyun), a genius mastermind who designs elaborate games for Korea's wealthiest citizens to bet astronomical sums of money on, conducted with real people in real-time using high-tech gadgets and CCTV cameras. To save his brother's life and his own, Ik-ho is forced to join Ace's game and follow instructions from a woman of mystery named Soo-kyung (BoA). Using his wits and skills against multiple adversaries, including cops and low-rent gangsters, Ik-ho completes seemingly impossible missions. Then he reaches the final round, during which he must find his brother in a huge soccer stadium, with a bomb strapped to his ankle and time ticking.
