Fatso!

The story is based on five friends: two young couples Nandini (Gul Panag) and Navin (Purab Kohli), Yash (Neil Bhoopalam) and Tanuja (Gunjan Bakshi), plus their mutual buddy, the hugely overweight Sudeep (Ranvir Shorey). Nandini and Navin are about to get married when disaster strikes. On their way home from Navin's bachelor party, the three boys – Navin, Yash, and Sudeep – are involved in a car crash where one of them is killed. An angel named Vijay (Brijendra Kala) escorts Navin to heaven. But when Navin wakes up in heaven, he discovers to his horror that through a clerical error Vijay had collected the wrong soul from the accident site: it was Sudeep, not Navin, who was destined to have died in the car crash! Navin makes a scene in the overcrowded waiting room of heaven and demands that he be returned to earth, and to his loved ones. But by this time Navin's body back on earth has already been destroyed. So the angel Vijay arranges for Navin's soul to return to earth into Sudeep's body. This film is about how Navin (Purab Kohli) returns to earth and has to woo his beloved fiancée Nandini all over again ... now trapped in the body of "Fatso" Sudeep (Ranvir Shorey).
