Rajakumaran

Rajakumaran (Prabhu) is the son of the village chief (Vijayakumar). Yuvaraj (Nassar) hates Rajakumaran and his village. Selvi (Meena) and Vaidehi (Nadhiya) are in love with their cousin Rajakumaran but he chooses Vaidehi. Selvi decides to sacrifice her love due to which her father Selvaraj (Captain Raju) refuses to give his property to village people as promised. To give away the property, his only request is that Rajakumaran get married to Selvi. Selvi convinces Rajakumaran to lie, he lies to her father and he gets the property. Later, Vaidehi commits suicide and Rajakumaran reveals his lie. One day, some goons decide to put a bomb and Rajakumaran saves the village. The village thinks that the culprit was Thangaraj (Thyagu) because he wanted to take revenge against Rajakumaran for his lie. Angry, Thangaraj insults Rajakumaran's father in public and Rajakumaran's father dies. Yuvaraj asks Selvaraj and Thangaraj permission to marry Selvi, and they accept. The village is against the marriage. A man (R. V. Udayakumar) comes and says that a deaf-mute girl, who learnt to read and to write, was the witness to Vaidehi's murder by Yuvaraj. On the day of the marriage, Yuvaraj cancels the marriage and decides to humiliate Selvi. Rajakumaran saves her and decides to marry her.
