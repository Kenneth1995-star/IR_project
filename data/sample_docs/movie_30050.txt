Meanwhile, Gopalakrishnan and Kalyani (Sreeja) squabble whenever they meet. One day, Kalyani's mother dies and Gopalakrishnan brings her at his home. Later, Suresh and Sugandhi fall in love with each other and they get married secretly. Suresh's mother is later killed and the innocent Gopalakrishnan is arrested.
