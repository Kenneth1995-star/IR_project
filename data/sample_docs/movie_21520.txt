We Still Kill the Old Way (2014 film)

A retired East End gangster, Ritchie Archer, returns to London from Spain to investigate the violent sadistic murder of his brother, Charlie, at the hands of a local street gang called E2. In the process, Ritchie discovers that the police are pussyfooting around the case, out of incompetence, fear or both. Ritchie and his old mates gather to pay their last respects to Charlie, and then set about getting revenge.
