Venu (Mohanlal) is a high-profile news cameraman working in Reuters. He graduated from a premier film institute but preferred to shoot news rather than the manipulated visuals for movies. He is mostly based in Delhi but has come to Kochi to appear for a case in which he is involved. He is assigned to cover a case involving a local politician where he gets to meet Renuka (Amala Paul). Renuka is the executive editor of Bharath Vision and Venu and Renuka have a story to tell of their own. A flashback tells the story about how two lovers turned into foes.
Rishikesh (Biju Menon) is another channel head NBI ((News Bureau of India)), who is going through some difficult times, as some of his star performers have gone in search of greener pastures. Venu and Renuka come together to investigate a particular story about a murder planned by Bharathan Pillai (Sai Kumar), a major politician who had lost his fame and name before many years when Venu and Renuka exposed a scam involving him.
