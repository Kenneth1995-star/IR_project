Subah Ka Tara

The film, told in flash-back, starts with a few people troubling a disheveled, insane man holding a bedding. The mad man is Mohan (Pradeep Kumar) who finally sits down with a sympathiser and starts narrating the story. Mohan meets a young widow, Padmini (Jayshree) taking medicine for her dying mother. Padmini's mother, from her death-bed, warns her about befriending young men as she's a widow and society demands that she live alone with just a white sheet as a companion, for that's her life as a widow. Following her mother's death, Padmini goes to her paternal uncle's house to live. Her uncle has gone to Africa and her Aunt treats her badly. Mohan falls ill thinking about Padmini's situation and her rebuff when he pursues her. He is looked after by his mother and young sister (Baby Rajshree). Padmini is made to work as a maid in her Uncle's house but has a kind cousin sister, Bharti (Chandrakanta). Mohan arrives there on some work and the Aunt has chosen him as a suitable boy for Bharti's marriage. Mohan sees Padmini and tells her how he feels, which is overheard by the Aunt. The Aunt throws Padmini out of the house to fend for herself. The story continues with the problems Padmini faces, Mohan's search for Padmini and her death when she sets the house left by her mother, on fire. Mohan finds the bedding in the aftermath of the fire and goes insane.
