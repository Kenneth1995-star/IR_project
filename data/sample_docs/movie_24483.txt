Anari

Raj Kumar is an honest, handsome and intelligent young man. He works as a sole trader and being a painter by trade, he is unable to earn a living and unable to pay rent to his kind-hearted but talkative landlady, Mrs. D'sa. One day, Raj finds a wallet containing money and returns it to the owner, Mr. Ramnath. Ramnath admires Raj and pleased with his honesty, and employs him to work in his office as a clerk. Raj meets with Ramnath's maidservant Asha and soon both fall in love. This all ends when Raj finds out that Asha is really Aarti, the niece of his employer. Unfortunately, his landlady dies consuming medicine manufactured by his employer, Mr. Ramnath, and she passes away suddenly, leaving Raj Kumar alone. The police conduct a post-mortem and as a result find out that Mrs. D'sa was poisoned. Raj became the prime suspect and is subsequently taken for questioning and is arrested and held in a cell. In the trial that he faces, however, Ramnath reveals the truth and thus Raj is saved.
