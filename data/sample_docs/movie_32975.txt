Hitokiri

Okada Izō is a ronin born into poverty who joins the Kinnō-tō (ja), a group of Imperial loyalists based in Tosa and headed by Takechi Hanpeita. Okada soon becomes a well known and successful killer, and he is stubbornly loyal to Hanpeita. However, Sakamoto Ryōma warns him that he is merely "Takechi's dog" and that Hanpeita will end up betraying him. Eventually abandoning Hanpeita, the regretful Okada returns and apologizes. He is then ordered to assassinate the aristocrat Anenokōji using the sword of Tanaka Shinbei. The assassination is successful, and during his interrogation over Anenokōji's death, Tanaka commits harakiri after his recovered sword is presented to him as evidence. As Hanpeita becomes increasingly determined to succeed in his plan to become daimyo of Tosa by supporting the Emperor, it becomes necessary to sacrifice Okada, which he does by having him arrested and later trying to poison him. Okada, disillusioned, confesses to his murders for the Kinnō-tō, and he is condemned to crucifixion. Before being killed, he is told that Hanpeita will be forced to commit harakiri.[2]
