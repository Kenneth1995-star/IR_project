Sapnon Ka Mandir

Sanjay (Jeetendra) and Sangeeta (Jayapradha) love each other and get married. Their desire to have many children is marred for Sangeeta, who can have only one child, who turns to be a healthy baby boy. The boy grows up into an intelligent school student. One day, when he does not return from school, his parents panic and frantically search for him everywhere. The only two suspects they have in mind are Gulu (Gulshan Grover), who still lusts after Sangeeta; and Maulah Baba (Kader Khan), a blind beggar.
