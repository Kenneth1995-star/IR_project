Iron Fisted Monk

Hawker (Sammo Hung), is sent to the Shaolin Temple by the Iron Fisted Monk (Chan Sing), after he saves Hawker from a beating by the Manchu's. After being trained by his master (James Tien) he runs away from the temple, only to be confronted by his master and forced to take the four tests. Whilst this is happening, an official (Fung Hak-on) is indulging in his passion for raping women, and is virtually above the law as he is a powerful Manchu officer. He begins by raping Liang's (Lo Hoi-pang) sister (Chu Ching), who then commits suicide and makes Liang a very angry man. Liang takes his revenge by killing one of those pesky Manchus but everyone thinks Hawker is responsible.
Both Liang and Hawker go to meet the Iron Fisted Monk who convinces Hawker to teach all the workers at the dye factory kung fu, so they can defend themselves against the Manchus. The final act involves the Manchus' butchering of the workers from the dye factory, rape of Liang's wife and the murder of his mother. When Liang eventually dies from his wounds, both Hawker and the Iron Fisted Monk swear vengeance on the Manchus and it is delivered.
