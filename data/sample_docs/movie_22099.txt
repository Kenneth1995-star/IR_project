Wilby Wonderful

The small Canadian Maritimes island town of Wilby is preparing for its annual fair as a scandal threatens to rock its very foundation: the local newspaper is about to publish details and names of men caught during a police raid at Wilby Watch, a large undeveloped area on the island.
In the midst of it, Wilby's inhabitants attempt to maintain business as usual. Overbusy realtor Carol French is trying to sell the mayor her late mother-in-law’s house while supervising the festival, trying to achieve her social ambitions while painfully trying to avoid her husband's efforts to discuss their marriage. Her police officer husband, good-natured Buddy, investigating the rumors of gay sex and drugs at the Watch with his partner Stan, is distracted by his burgeoning love affair with former high school classmate Sandra Anderson. Sandra just got back to the island and re-opened a coffee shop, her bad reputation as a promiscuous woman a painful fact in her life. Sandra’s teenaged daughter Emily resentfully observes her mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions. After his wife has left him in the wake of the pending gay scandal, the new-to-town depressive video store owner Dan Jarvis keeps trying to kill himself, and Duck MacDonald, the town’s handyman, keeps interrupting his attempts. Duck remains stoic in front of the turmoil, seemingly the only one (silently) recognizing everyone else's dramas while himself persistently seeking Dan's company. And the town's mayor may be playing up the scandal in order to conclude a deal to turn the Watch into a golf course.
The scandal will force the characters to reevaluate their lives and come to terms with their own secrets and lies.
