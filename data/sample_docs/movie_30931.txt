Rajadhi Raja

Raja (Raghava Lawrence), a native of Coutrallam, is a happy-go-lucky-youngster. Tragedy strike his life when his father loses his hand when a doctor in an inebriated condition operates on him. As expected his father is gagged by cops and lawyers. They assault him. In his death bed, his father gets a promise that he would make his three brothers into a cop, lawyer and doctor. Though Raja realises his mission, he falls for his own acts. The trio (who become doctor, policeman and a lawyer) gang up with a baddie Shylu (Mumtaj), a gangster, who rises to become a Minister. It is up to Raja to end their atrocities and teach them a lesson. In between, Raja comes across young women (Snigdha, Kamna Jethmalani and Meenakshi) and sings foot-tapping romantic duets with kamna a nurse whose dress changing and nudity is captured by his doctor brother and he helps her.Shylu dislikes Raja as he had attacked her earlier.Shylu had shared her bed earlier to many for her position now.
