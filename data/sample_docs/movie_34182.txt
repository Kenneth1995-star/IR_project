The film takes place in 11 different cities in Russia and tells the story of a series of different characters whose acquaintance is purely coincidental. The characters find themselves on New Year's Eve in difficult situations which they can only escape if they find help, by miracle or through six degrees of separation. According to this theory all the people on Earth are connected through six handshakes.
The film begins in Kaliningrad, the last city in Russia to celebrate the New Year. The story revolves around a local orphanage during the holiday. One orphan girl Varya, makes other children believe that her father is the Russian president. They promise to stop harassing her if her father blesses her with an encrypted message during the traditional televised New Year's Address. She does not know what to do, and her friend Vova tries to help and tells her about the Six Degrees of Separation theory. The characters in the film are a student, a thief and his connections with the policeman who caught him, a taxi driver in love with a famous pop singer, a businessman rushing to his beloved, two snowboarders. And so with the Caucasian snow cleaner at the Red Square, Varia's request is passed on to the Russian president who notices the encrypted message written on the snow in the Kremlin courtyard. On the New Year's Eve, the phrase "Santa Claus helps the one who helps himself" appears in the president's speech (Dmitri Medvedev makes a cameo appearance), thus verifying the theory of six degrees of separation.
