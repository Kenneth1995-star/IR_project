The Night We Got the Bird

When unscrupulous Brighton antiques dealer Cecil Gibson (Ronald Shiner) dies, his widow Julie (Dora Bryan) remarries, and she and new husband Bertie (Brian Rix) go off on honeymoon. But they are chased by a gangster because of a fake antique bed that the late Cecil pawned off for quick cash. In addition, it appears Cecil the dealer has reincarnated as a mouthy South American parrot, whose aim is to make married life difficult for his wife and Bertie.[3]
