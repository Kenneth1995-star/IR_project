For Those in Peril

Aspiring RAF pilot Pilot Officer Rawlings (Ralph Michael) fails to make the grade in training, and grudgingly accepts the alternative of joining the crew of Launch 183, an air-sea rescue craft skippered by Flight Lieutenant Murray (David Farrar). Rawlings is initially resentful and bored by the apparent mundanity and lack of excitement of the life, until the vessel is called on to rescue the crew of an RAF bomber shot down in mid-Channel.
Having accomplished the rescue, the boat runs into an enemy minefield during its return and is attacked by German air and sea forces. When Murray is killed, Rawlings has to take charge and bring the vessel safely back.
