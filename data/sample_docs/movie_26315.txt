Vivek Agnihotri

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the U.S.A., an explosion in a motorboat shatters the peace on Christmas Eve in London, UK. Following this incident is a daring robbery on an armoured vehicle carrying billions of pounds. The police suspect two Indians: PP (Irrfan Khan) and Sim (Tanushree Dutta). They are interrogated extensively amidst allegations that they may be linked to Al-Qaeda.
Crime journalist Monsoon Iyer (Sushma Reddy) learns about their plight, meets them, and asks her boyfriend advocate Krishan Pundit (Anil Kapoor) to represent them. Krishan meets with the two, listens to their side of the incidents, is convinced of their innocence, and is quite sure that the two incidents — as well as the deaths of three of PP and Sim's friends (Chip (Arshad Warsi), Deva (Emraan Hashmi) and Rocker (Sunil Shetty)) — were the actions of a notorious terrorist named Murtaza Arzai.
