Sindhu Nathi Poo

Thirukkaval (Ranjith) is back to his village. At his back, he is respected and treated as God by the villagers. Thirukkaval still hates his father Chettiar (Jaishankar), stepmother Azhamu (Kavitha), stepbrother and stepsister. The kind-hearted Thirukkaval quickly makes enemies including Munnumunuthan (Vasu Vikram), Kodumudi (Kazan Khan) and his father Chettiar. Meanwhile, Pasupathy (Ravi Shankar) and Chinna Pulla (Rajakumari) are in love. The affair is soon exposed, so Thirukkaval arranges their wedding. Shortly, Pasupathy dies in an accident and the villagers blame Thirukkaval.
In the past, Thirukkaval lived happily with his father Chettiar, his mother Shenbaga Valli and his baby sister Chittu. Chettiar had an affair with Shenbaga Valli's sister Azhamu and Azhamu became pregnant. Unable to bear the situation, Shenbaga Valli killed her baby and committed suicide. The angry Thirukkaval injured his father's foot and run away. He then became a child laborer.
Chinna Pulla's mother Appayi (Manorama) passes away. Soon, Thirukkaval is accused of having an affair with Chinna Pulla. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
