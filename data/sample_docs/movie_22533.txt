My Fair Son

A teenage boy, Ray, returns home from a life with his grandfather to live with his father, after they have been estranged for several years. During the period of their estrangement, Ray spent much of his youth rebelling against his father's lifestyle. After he enrolls in an art school, Ray becomes romantically involved, in a relationship, with another male student, and the pair soon become lovers. His father discovers the two young men in bed together, and begins to understand what it means to live as a homosexual. Ray then meets one of his father's employees, Bo, and falls in love with him, too. Bo is engaged, and admits to Ray's father that he is in love with his son.[1][3][4] The father fires Bo and lies to Ray that he left on his own will. Ray does not accept his father's argument. The film ends with Ray roaming on a terrace with floating transparent images of his childhood pictures.
