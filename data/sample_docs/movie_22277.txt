Dan Barnes (Steve Austin) is a former pro boxer who retired after growing weary of his violent existence. While Matthew learns how to box and stand up to his tormentors, one of whom is the school boxing champ (Jaren Brandt Bartlett), Dan's new found role as a teacher helps him come to terms with his tumultuous past. Throughout the film Matthew (Daniel Magder), is in a constant being bullied by Jaren, on various occasions Jaren and his friends targeted Matthew and would constantly do anything to get under his skin. Matthew had a passion for boxing, due to the fact that his grandfather was one of the top boxers at his earlier age. Matthew had troubles with his mom and step father accepting him to join the boxing club at school. Matthew had to argue back and fourth with his family in order for his parent's to allow him to join the boxing club. Once he got accepted into the school boxing club, the first day he had to spar with his tormentor bully Jaren. As they sparred in the boxing rink, Jaren was very aggressive towards Matthew. Once the referee blew the whistle and said stop fighting, Matthew took a cheap shot at Jaren which led him to being kicked out of the boxing club on the first day. Dan the janitor saw the whole thing, and talked to Matthew, noticing Matthew was really upset about the entire situation. Dan then took the responsibility of helping Matthew achieve his boxing dream. Matthew trained, and did whatever it took to become the best he could be. With the help of his coach Dan, Matthew was able to train and become a better boxer. Throughout his training with Dan, Dan trained him both mentally and physically, and gave Matthew an opportunity to box his all time bully Jaren and gave him another opportunity to join back into the boxing club.
