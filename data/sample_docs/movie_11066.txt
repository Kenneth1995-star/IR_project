Shadows in the Storm

Thelonious Pitt (Ned Beatty), a daydreaming businessman, goes to the Redwood Forests of California. There, he meets a beautiful woman, Melanie (Mia Sara). She looks like the woman he has been seeing in his dreams.
At the river late at night, when Melanie's husband finds them, he attacks Thelonious until Melanie pulls out a pistol and fires three shots at her husband. His body goes into the river. That is when the nightmare begins.[1][2]
