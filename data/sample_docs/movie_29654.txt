Sakalakala Vallavan

Agriculturist Velu (Kamal Haasan) goes to extremes to attain revenge against his devious landlord and her family. He is an upright young man, but when his family gets cheated out of money and his sister gets raped by the landlord's son, he decides it's time to take a stand. Donning various disguises, he—with help from his sister Valli (Thulasi) and friend Poonae (Y. G. Mahendran) – sets out seeking justice against the landlord and her confrontational daughter Geetha (Ambika) and son Pazhani (Raveendran).
