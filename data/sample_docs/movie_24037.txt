Arekti Premer Golpo

The film is about Abhiroop Sen (Rituparno Ghosh), a Delhi-based transgender documentary filmmaker, whose bisexual lover is the cinematographer (Indraneil Sengupta) of the film. They visit Kolkata to make a documentary on the life of the real-life legendary jatra actor Chapal Bhaduri, who in his heyday was known as 'Chapal Rani', noted for his portrayal of female roles on the stage at a time when women did not perform on stage. Initially Abhiroop Sen has to face some difficulties to start the documentary, as he is a transgender. But with Chapal Bhaduri's support Abhiroop starts the shoot. During the course of the shoot, Abhiroop feels himself in the position of Chapal Bhaduri. The film goes on with a comparison between Abhiroop's intimate relation with Indraneil Sengupta, who is married to Rani (Churni Ganguly) and Chapal Bhaduri's (Rituparno Ghosh) relation with Kumar(Indraneil Sengupta), who is married to Gopa (Churni Ganguly). In the course of the film Abhiroop gets attached to Uday and Chapal Bhaduri to Tushar, both played by Jisshu Sengupta. The film takes the viewers through the present life of Abhiroop Sen and past life of Chapal Bhaduri with the same actors. The film focuses on the mental trauma faced by a transgender, the rejection by men, after using them sexually.
