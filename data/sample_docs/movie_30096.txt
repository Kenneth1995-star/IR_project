Radha (Roja) is the daughter of the wealthy NRI Viswanathan (Kalyan Kumar) who resides in the United States. Radha brought up in Chennai by her father's friend Manikandan (Janagaraj). Radha is in love with another man Gautham (Bhanu Chander). Her father finds a groom in USA for her and wants his daughter to marry him, but Radha decides to marry her lover Gautham against the wishes of her father. Manikandan supports her will and helps them to get married. When her boyfriend finds out that she will be disinherited, he ditches her at the marriage registrar office.
After a short while her father decides to retract his disapproval and spend a fortnight's vacation with his daughter and son-in-law in his estate near a tribal community where Sundaram is the chief. Because her father is already ill and because this may be his last vacation, Radha and Manikandan want to make it as happy for him as possible. They decide to conceal the fact that her boyfriend dumped her.
Manikandan hires the small-time crook Kannan (Sathyaraj) to play the part of the husband for a fortnight. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
