Agraharathil Kazhutai

Narayana Swamy, a professor and resident of a Brahmin village, adopts a new-born donkey after an enraged crowd kills its mother. The donkey becomes the sole companion to a deaf-mute maid who works in Narayana Swamy's house. There is chaos among the villagers upon the arrival of the donkey and kids start playing pranks on the donkey. Thinking that having a donkey in the village will ruin them, the villagers attack and kill the donkey. Soon after its death, miracles start happening in the village. Slowly people believe all that is because of the donkey and start worshipping its dead body. They arrange for a ritual funeral for the donkey before burning it. In the end, the fire spreads around the village and kills all the people. The professor and his maid are the lone survivors.
