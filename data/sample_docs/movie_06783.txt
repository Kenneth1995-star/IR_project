Gun Battle at Monterey

After he and his partner, Reno (Ted de Corsia), hold up a bank, Turner (Sterling Hayden) decides he wants to branch out on his own. When he tells Reno, Reno shoots him and makes of with the money. But Turner doesn't die â€” rather, he is discovered and mended by a beautiful Mexican woman named Maria (Pamela Duncan). After he is fully recovered, Turner sets off to exact his revenge on Reno, vowing never to rest until Reno is dead and he's recovered his share of the loot.
