Prema Bandhan

Ananthu (M. K. Radha) falls in love with two women, Lalitha (T. Suryakumari) and Neela (R. B. Lakshmi Devi). Bhaskar (K. K. Swami), a wealthy man, is also in love with Neela and tries to end her romance with Ananthu. Neela meets with a car accident and, to the surprise of everyone, reveals in her dying breathing that she had planned the accident so that Lalitha could marry Ananthu.[1]
