Chattam

Gauri Shankar (Jagapathi Babu) is a circle inspector of Punjagutta and is known as a heavy corrupt police officer. Rangarao (Jeeva) is his assistant and his daughter Sindhu (Vimala Raman) is an aerobics, teacher. Once, two sons of a big industrialist (Prasad Babu) kill two girls for not accepting their love by pouring acid on them. Soon, the two get killed by some unidentified person in the same fashion. The industrialist uses his political influence and gets the case investigated by the CB-CID. The police commissioner (Chalapathi Rao) calls Gowri and tells him to hand over all the evidence to the CB-CID officer (Murali Sharma). Even as the CID officer is investigating, another two persons get murdered in the same fashion. The CID officer makes an in-depth study into the case and finally comes to the conclusion that it is Gowri, who is behind these murders. At this juncture, Gowri leaves for Mumbai and kills some gangsters who were kidnapping and selling young girls and exporting them to other countries. After he kills all the gangsters, the Mumbai police arrest him and keeps him in a jail, where an international terrorist Kasab from Pakistan was placed. The CBI officer gets a doubt and warns the jailer that Gowri intentionally surrendered to the police as he wanted to kill Kasab. What happens next should be seen on-screen.[2]
