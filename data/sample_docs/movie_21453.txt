The Anomaly

The film is set in a futuristic setting, where significant advances in science and technology have been made. Ex-soldier Ryan Reeve (Noel Clarke) wakes up in the back of a van[1] next to a young boy, Alex (Art Parkinson), who is being held prisoner. Strangely, the boy seems to think he is the kidnapper though he has no memory of ever having seen the boy before. After freeing the boy and attempting to figure out what has happened to him, he blacks out again and awakes in a room with a mysterious young man named Harkin Langham (Ian Somerhalder), who seems to think he is someone else.
When Langham discovers who he really is, he disables Reeve and knocks him out. Reeve then wakes up in a mysterious bedroom having sex with a beautiful young woman (Alexis Knapp). The girl identifies herself as a prostitute named Dana, seems to remember meeting and engaging in sexual activity with a much more violent and sociopathic version of Reeve. He tries to explain his predicament, but she remains skeptical. He asks her to come with him, but she says she cannot leave as she is the "property" of a Russian gangster named Sergio. Reeve offers to free her if she will help him solve the mystery that his life has become. The two manage to escape, but Reeve again loses consciousness when the mind control system reboots.
He must work out what is happening in bursts of exactly nine minutes and forty-seven seconds, as the control and conscious awareness of his body is repeatedly being hijacked by another person. He teams up with the mysterious "Dana" (Alexis Knapp) as he battles a conspiracy known as "Anomaly" led by Harkin Langham (Ian Somerhalder).
