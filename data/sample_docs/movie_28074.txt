Madhya Venal (മദ്ധ്യവേനൽ)

Sarojini (Swetha Menon) is a house wife and is also a social worker. In her village, majority of the villagers depend on the Khadi weaving mills for their livelihood. Sarojini too runs a mill. Her husband Kumaran (Manoj K. Jayan) is a political worker. Praveen (Arun Bala) who is an executive from a new generation bank comes to help the villagers. Without any proper documents he lends money to them. Being innocent they do not realize the trick behind Praveen's business.
Sarojini and Kumaran try their level best to make the people understand Praveen's intention. Meanwhile, Praveen fakes love for Manikutty, the daughter of Kumaran and Sarojini, since they were against him.
