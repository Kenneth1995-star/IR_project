Hyderabad-bred Vasu goes to a village, where he meets and falls in love with a village belle, Lakshmi. She also is attracted to him, and both get married. After their marriage, both go to live with Vasu's parents, brother Panduranga Rao, and sister-in-law, Janaki, and her son, Sonu. Lakshmi gets close to Sonu, and starts to spend all her time with him. This raises some concerns with Janaki, which results in some acrimony. Tragically, Sonu passes away, leaving Lakshmi devastated and depressed. She gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl, but cannot get Sonu out of her mind. Her depression gives way to insanity, as she keeps on seeing Sonu in every child, and as a result she is institutionalized. Vasu has taken to alcohol in a big way and drowns his sorrows and frustrations day and night in a drunken stupor. As a result, his daughter is adopted by Janaki and his brother, without knowing who her real parents are. Years pass by, their daughter, Sobha, has grown up and is herself a mother of a baby boy, and is going to settled in the U.S.. Before leaving, the entire family assembles to visit Lakshmi. They find her holding a piece of log, covered in a blanket, singing to it as if it where Sonu. It is here that Sobha finds out who her real parents are, and it is here that she will be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice.
