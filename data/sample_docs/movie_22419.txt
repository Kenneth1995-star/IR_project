Weirdos

Kit (Dylan Authors) is a 15-year-old living in a small town in Nova Scotia with his single father (Allan Hawco) and grandmother (Cathy Jones). He is dating Alice (Julia Sarah Stone) despite being unsure of his own sexuality. Deciding that he wants to go live with his mother (Molly Parker) in Sydney, Kit enlists Alice's help to embark on a hitchhiking trip.Throughout the trip, Kit also has regular imaginary conversations with Andy Warhol (Rhys Bevan-John), who has appointed himself Kit's "spirit animal".
