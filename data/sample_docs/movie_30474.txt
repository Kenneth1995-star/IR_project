Devan

When the movie opens, Devan (Arun Pandian) is seen murdering photographer Jeeva (Thalaivasal Vijay) in cold blood in his house. Jeeva strategically positions a video camera to capture the impending murder, but Devan never shows his face to it, and when Jeeva shouts out the name of his killer before dying, the audio is lost at that point. While the police search for the killer, Devan zeroes in on Chetta (Saikumar) as his next target. He follows Chetta to Chandigarh but is apprehended by CBI officer Rathnavel (Vijayakanth). But once Ratnavel realises Chetta's true nature, he begins to help Devan, even hiring successful lawyer Chakravarthy(Karthik) to fight for him.
The flashback shows that Devan's sister (Kausalya) was killed by Chetta. Earlier, Chetta and Devan were friends, but Chetta had a false eye on Kausalya. He used to spy on her when she was bathing, and one day she finds it and then slaps him in public. Chetta decides to take revenge, and on her wedding day, they drug her and send her to church in brides costume with no dress underneath, then Chetta grabs her costume from the car, thus making her completely naked in front of public, then he shoots her and her groom. Devan wants to avenge the death of his sister. In the climax, the villain is killed.
