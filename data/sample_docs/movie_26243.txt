Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo

Major General Amarjeet Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) is a dedicated officer for the Indian Army. His son Lieutenant Commander Vikramjeet Singh (Bobby Deol) follows in his footsteps and joins the Navy. In 1971 during the Indo-Pak war and the formation of Bangladesh, Lt. Commander Vikramjeet Singh has a ship in his command and a regiment of soldiers of the Indian Army, commandeered by his dad, Major General Amarjeet Singh. The ship comes under attack by a submarine of the Pakistani Navy, undergoes damage, and sinks along with Vikramjeet, but not before he courageously rescues about a hundred trapped army soldiers.
Years later, Vikramjeet's son Kunaljeet joins the army as a Captain, but he lacks the values his dad and grandfather had in them about serving the country selflessly. He just wants to be employed with the army for a couple of years, then re-locate to the U.S., run a business, and make lots of money. In order to accomplish this he always makes up excuses of not going to the front. He falls in love with Shweta Bhansali, and decides to stay in the army in order to be close to her. In order to achieve a medal, he fakes heroism; then carelessly jeopardizes a planned attack on terrorists and as a result several terrorist escape to their hideouts. Disciplined and chastised, an injured and humbled Kunaljeet waits to meet his sweetheart - only to find out that she is in love and married to his senior officer Major Rajeev Singh, who was assumed to be dead but actually was a prisoner of war. The only thread binding him to the army is broken, and it is then Kunaljeet finds out that the terrorists in collusion with rebel Pakistani officers are planning to bomb the Bhagwan Shivji's Amarnath Temple in Jammu & Kashmir in order to wipe foment communal strife. Kunaljeet saves everyone and wins his grandfather's heart.
