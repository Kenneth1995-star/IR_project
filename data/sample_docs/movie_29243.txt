Kaanal Neer

Suren (Nageswara Rao) hails from a zamindari family. Unable to get permission to pursue his studies, he leaves home and reaches Madras, hiding his identity. A rich man engages him to teach his younger daughter Pramila; his elder daughter Madhavi (Bhanumathi) has become a widow at a young age. Hearing about the goodness of the teacher, she gets drawn to him though she has never met him. Later, due to mischievous relatives, she begins to dislike him and dismisses him. Suren is involved in a horse-carriage accident and admitted to a hospital, after which his father takes him away. Suren, unable to forget Madhavi, names a village in his zamindari after her. To please his parents, he marries a young woman (Sowcar Janaki) but he cannot forget Madhavi. A conspiracy is hatched by evildoers to get Madhavi’s property. To fight for her rights, she goes to meet the zamindar not aware that he is Suren! Unable to neither forget her nor go against tradition, he pines away and dies in Madhavi’s arms.
