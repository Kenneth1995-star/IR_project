Meanwhile, Rekha arranges for Bhumika to get married to Vijay Adhiraj for his wealth. At this juncture Bhumika and Srikanth lie that they are already married. They both leave their parents and Srikanth starts earning to support Bhumika. Finishing his job assignment Jai Akash returns only to give yet another family responsibility as an excuse.
