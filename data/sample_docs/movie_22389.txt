My Internship in Canada (Guibord s'en va-t-en guerre)

The film stars Patrick Huard as Steve Guibord, an independent, moderate Member of Parliament from northern Quebec, who unexpectedly finds himself in the position of becoming the tie-breaking voter on whether Canada will go to war in the Middle East.[2] Embarking on a tour of his constituency to evaluate public opinion, various lobby groups and Canada's Prime Minister spins the debate farther and farther out of control.
Guibord's confusion and eventual national tour is documented by Souverain (Irdens Exantus), his Haitian immigrant intern, who often calls his mother (and an increasing audience of passerbys) with updates on the ever-increasing situation.[2]
