Castaway on the Moon

Kim Seong-geun (Jung Jae-young) is deep in debt and his life seems completely hopeless. He jumps off a bridge into the Han River and washes up on the shore of Bamseom, which lies directly below the bridge. After searching the island he finds it is filled mostly with vegetation and surrounded by the city but too far to shout and he can't swim. He finds a duck-shaped boat and begins to like living on the island, free of his debt and worries of city life, though it is not easy.
As he learns to survive on the island, his cries for help scrawled in the sand are seen by Kim Jung-yeon (Jung Ryeo-won), a Hikikomori who spots him while engaging in her nightly habit of photographing the moon. They soon begin exchanging messages, with Jung-yeon venturing out of her house to throw bottled messages onto the island, and Seong-geun writing his replies in the sand.
A torrential storm arrives destroying Seong-geun's farm and sweeps away the possessions he has collected, following which he is found by a group of workers sent to clean up litter on the island. He boards a bus in the city where Jung-yeon, who, after overcoming her anxiety and running across the bridge to find him, manages to finally meet him.
