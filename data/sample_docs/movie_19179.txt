The Purple Plain

Bill Forrester (Gregory Peck), a RCAF pilot serving in the Royal Air Force in Burma, flying de Havilland Mosquitos, a two-seat fighter-bomber. Forrester is emotionally distraught after losing his new wife in the Blitz in London and has become self destructive, seeking to end his life in action. "You'd think that would be easy in a war", he explains to a Burmese woman, Anna, "but I just kept getting medals instead." With Anna's support, Bill begins to recover his emotional stability.
Forrester and his new navigator, Carrington (Lyndon Brook), on a routine non-combat flight to Meiktila, with Flight Lieutenant Blore (Maurice Denham) as passenger in the Mosquito's bomb bay, because of an engine fire, is forced to go down in a remote desert area of Burma's central plain controlled by the Japanese. As the three men struggle to survive in the hostile environment, the self-destructive Bill finally realises that he can depend on support from others and that he may have someone to live for. Blore, however, abandons them to attempt to return to the crash site and commits suicide.
