6 Days

On 30 April 1980, six Iranians led by Salim storm the Iranian Embassy located in 16 Princes Gate, Kensington in London and hold at least 26 hostages. Notable persons have been summoned by the incident, including SAS members led by Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin, BBC Reporter Kate Adie, and Chief Inspector Max Vernon of Metropolitan Police. The authorities receive a call from Salim, demanding the release of 91 Arab prisoners in Iran, or else they will kill a hostage if the demands are not met.
On Day 2, Max negotiates with Salim by phone, saying that Max will help him by means of no violence. After that, Salim releases one hostage, due to illness, but Salim maintains his promise that he will start killing the hostages. After Max brings food to the terrorists, Salim speaks to Max, demanding two buses to Heathrow Airport in two days.
On Day 3 and 4, Salim calls again, demanding that the Ambassador speak with them. Salim's right-hand man, Faisal, takes one hostage to be killed. However, the Iranian authorities refuse to be part of the negotiation. Salim calls Max, demanding to speak to the BBC, and Max reluctantly agrees. A vengeful Salim says that his people are being tortured by the Persians. Afterwards, Salim reluctantly releases another hostage.
On Day 5, as per Salim's demand, the BBC World Service are able to broadcast the message from the terrorists, stating that the reason for arriving in the UK is because of the oppression by the Iranian government in Arabistan. Hearing the news, Salim thanks Max and releases two hostages.
On Day 6, Faisal kills a hostage after the demand of bringing the bus is not met. The shooting prompts the SAS to take action of infiltrating the embassy. Once inside, they manage to release the hostages safely and kill the terrorists including Salim and Faisal.
