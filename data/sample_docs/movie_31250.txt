Tanisha is a young daughter of a man working for the brutal underworld mafia Gulzar and Haydar. When Tanisha's father decides he wants to leave the crime world to make a better life for his daughter, Gulzar and Haydar kills him, and family in order to eliminate a potential threat. Gulzar kills everyone in the family, and when he is about to kill Tanisha, she stabs him and vows to him she will kill them one day before escaping. She grows up to be a stone-cold assassin. She receives training from her uncle and ultimately engages in vigilante murders that she hopes will lead her to her ultimate target, the powerful underworld crime syndicate responsible for her parents' death.
