The Unseen

The film stars Aden Young as Bob Longmore, a man struggling with a mysterious disease which is causing his body to slowly become invisible. Having abandoned his family eight years earlier when the condition began emerging, he lives in a logging town in the far north of British Columbia, isolating himself as much as possible and keeping his body carefully covered whenever he does have to interact with people.
When his ex-wife Darlene (Camille Sullivan) calls him to discuss their troubled teenage daughter Eva (Julia Sarah Stone), he resolves to return to the city, but is forced to deliver a supply of drugs for Crisby (Ben Cotton) in exchange for the repair of his vehicle; the visit becomes further complicated when Eva disappears soon after his return, forcing him to juggle the drug delivery with trying to find his daughter.[2]
