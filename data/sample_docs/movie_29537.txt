Muthu (Kamal) is an 18-year-old simpleton who works in a small village. He is sexually harassed by his landlord's sister, a widow. Unable to bear it any longer, Muthu goes to Madras(Chennai). However, he is again harassed in a similar way by people whom he meets. He finds work at a hotel as a room boy where he meets Srividya (Maragadham), a prostitute. He then rescues her once from a raid. After he saves her, she develops a soft spot towards him. He lives in Srividya's house as a servant but later is thrown away from her home. In the end kamal gets affected by an STD and is shown in a hospital being treated by a doctor (Major Sundarrajan) and eventually dies.
