You're My Boss

Pong (Coco Martin) is an executive assistant in an airline company where Georgina Lorenzana (Toni Gonzaga) works as an assistant vice president for marketing affairs. Georgina is an extremely driven, smart, but bossy alpha female who will do everything to close a very important deal with foreign investors. One is a Japanese client named Mr. Najimoto. Their big boss, Chief Commercial Officer Albert, who is also the president, assigns this deal to Georgina and asks Pong to assist her while he is away for a sabbatical.
During their meeting for this deal, Mr. Najimoto and his partner reveal that they wouldn't negotiate with anyone in the airline company and substitutes such as Georgina except for the president and Chief Commercial Officer. Left with no other choice, Georgina declares that Pong is the president Chief Commercial Officer out of panic. From that moment on, the two of them are tied into a pretense.
