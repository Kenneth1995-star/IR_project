Paap Ki Duniya

An honest jailer is thrilled when his sister tells him that she is in love with someone. However, the jailer's happiness quickly turns to shock and anger when he learns that the man that his sister is in love with is none other than the ruthless and notorious criminal Pasha, who he himself had arrested a short time ago.
Naturally, the jailer immediately objects to this alliance, but his sister, blinded by her love for Pasha, leaves her brother and goes with Pasha. Almost a year later, the jailer's sister arrives at his doorstep, bruised, beaten and clinging on to life while carrying an infant in her arms. She reveals that Pasha only married her so that he may be able to manipulate the jailor. When that scheme of his failed, he sold her to a brothel. The sister hands over her infant son to her brother and dies in his arms.
Still hungry for revenge against the jailor, Pasha kidnaps the jailor's only son, Ashok. He then renames him Suraj and raises him as his own son, turning him into a professional thief and criminal. Meanwhile, the jailor raises his nephew and Pasha's son Vijay to be an honest police inspector.
A game of cat and mouse ensues between the criminal Suraj and Inspector Vijay with both trying to outsmart the other. Things get really heated when both fall for the same girl, Arti. To make matters worse, Pasha decides that it is time to complete his revenge on the jailor.
