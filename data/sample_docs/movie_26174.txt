Boom

Anu Gaekwad (Madhu Sapre), Sheila Bardez (Padma Lakshmi) and Rina Kaif (Katrina Kaif) are three of India's top models and they are participating in a fashion show hosted by a prestigious brand of diamond jewelers. While on the ramp of the fashion show, one of the other models (perhaps intentionally) trips Anu, and she goes crashing down, which is a model's worst nightmare. Anu's supportive friends, Sheila and Rina, come to the rescue. The trio immediately confront the model who had tripped Anu and the argument (held in front of the audience) degenerates into a catfight. As the young ladies scuffle with each other, they are met with a big surprise. Hundreds of glittering stolen diamonds, which were due to be smuggled out of the country, fall from the model's hair and on to the ramp, only to be snatched up by paparazzi and celebrities alike.
Anu, Sheila and Rina are in shock as the fashion show turns to mayhem. The stolen diamonds are priceless and have to be recovered by the gangsters, who hold the three glamorous models responsible for the heist-gone-wrong. The diamonds were due to be smuggled to Dubai and were stolen by Chhote Mia (Jackie Shroff). They were then to be handed to his brothers. The leader of the trio, Bade Mia (Amitabh Bachchan) is determined to get the diamonds back and so begins a cat-and-mouse game between the three models and the three gangsters. Who will succeed in outwitting the others?
