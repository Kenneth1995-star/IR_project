Ilavattam

The movie begins with Suhasini who awards Cheenu and asks him to share his story of success with everybody.
Cheenu(Navdeep) is an honest and studious village guy who hails from a poor farmer's family. Despite his friends attempt to sway him towards the lusty distractions of adolescence he stands his ground and tries to persuade them to follow his path. Lakshmi (Sheela) is the second daughter of a zameendar also from the same village who studies at the same college as Cheenu. Despite their hatred for each other at the beginning they end up falling for each other after a lot of melodrama.
Lakshmi’s brother-in-law (her elder sister’s husband) Prithviraj lusts for her and tries to inherit their fortune by marrying both the zammendar’s daughters. He tries to beat Cheenu to death when everybody finds about their love affair. In an attempt to escape Prithviraj, the couple seeks protection from their district’s Collector Suhasini who assures them that she would help them get married to each other after they finish their education.
The movie ends with a tedious action episode between Cheenu and Prithviraj and the title rolls.
