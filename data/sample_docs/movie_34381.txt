Two Cops

The experienced detective Jo has a new partner, Kang who recently graduated from the Police Academy at the top of the class. The idealistic Kang always sticks to his principles and often conflicts with Jo, an amoral cop who always tries to take advantage of his position. Kang tries to win Jo over to his side, but fails. One day, a beautiful woman who works in a bar comes to the police station for help, and Kang falls in love with her. He starts going to the bar often to see her, and begins to become more like Jo. Jo is initially pleased at this, but later begins to experience a dilemma with Kang's change in attitude.
