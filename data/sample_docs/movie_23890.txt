A story that dates back to the '80s. An unusual machine makes an entry into a village. It is called TV. It provokes a huge ruckus with people from all over scrambling to have a look at this black and white TV stationed at the most wealthiest of village households.
A group of enthusiastic villagers getting together to dug a hole beside the house, setting up a bamboo pole where an antenna is mounted on top of it, the mechanic turning the antenna back and forth, the visuals coming out right occasionally but most times it looks as though there is a blizzard going on, with people of all shapes and sizes assembling on the floor â€“ these are but some of the cherished moments that naturally unfolded when TV made its debut in this village.[3]
