In the 1920s, Manga (Kapil Sharma) is an uneducated and jobless young man who dreams of joining the Police Force but fails at every attempt made to do so. During a visit to the village Naku Guda for his friend Heera's (Inaamulhaq) wedding, Manga comes across Sargi (Ishita Dutta) and falls in love with her, but because of being jobless Manga is unable to take forward his relationship with Sargi.
Manga was born with a unique ability that he could cure anyone's backache with a simple kick to their backside. One day he manages to cure Mark Daniel (Edward Sonnenblick) of his backache using the same ability of his. Impressed by this act of Manga, Mark offers him a job in the Police Force, which Manga happily accepts. Manga is now convinced that since he has a job now, Sargi's family won't object to his marriage with her and so he approaches Sargi's grandfather Lalaji (Aanjjan Srivastav) with regards to this. But Lalaji, who is a follower of Mahatma Gandhi refuses the proposal because Manga is working for the Britishers, the very same people with whom the people of the country are fighting to get their independence from.
