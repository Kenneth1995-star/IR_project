Kumaresan (Venkat Prabhu) is a milk vendor in his village, who hates the marriage and stays away from women. His elderly father (Velu Thigal) wants him to get married as soon as possible, but the Kumaresan stubbornly refuses to get married. During the college holidays, the city girl Gayathri (Nanditha Jennifer) comes to stay with her grandparents Chettiar (Shanmugasundaram) and Meenakshi (Varalakshmi). After initial clashes between Kumaresan and Gayathri, Gayathri is intrigued by its refusal to get married.
In the past, Kumaresan's brother got secretly married with a woman from a rich family. Kumaresan's family welcomed him and were happy for them. The young Kumaresan clashed with his sister-in-law, therefore the young couple left their home. Kumaresan fell sick after the departure of the couple, then Kumaresan and his father begged Kumaresan's brother to call on their mother (Sabitha Anand) but his sister-in-law refused to let him go. Before she died, Kumaresan's mother Chellamma asked Kumaresan to not be like his brother and to stay with his father. That day, Kumaresan took the decision of remaining single.
Meanwhile, Gayathri falls in love with Kumaresan. Gayathri then tied the mangala sutra to herself and lied to the villagers that Kumaresan is the one who tied the knot. Gayathri's grandparents and Kumaresan's father agree for their marriage. Kumaresan doesn't want to live with her, so he tries several ways to drive Gayathri out of his house. Afterwards, the village doctor Rajasekhar (Ramji), who knows about the matter, establishes the truth at the village court and the couple split up. Gayathri then goes to back to her parents. Kumaresan, who felt alone, realises that he was in love with Gayathri but it was too late. The film ends with Gayathri returning to his home and they immediately get married.
