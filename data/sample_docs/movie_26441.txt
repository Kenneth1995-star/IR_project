Fool n Final

A million-worth diamond discovered in India is stolen and sent to Dubai. To pick up the diamond from Dubai Airport, Rocky (Chunkey Pandey) is sent. However, a dreaded underworld don, Moscow Chikna (Arbaaz Khan) kidnaps Rocky and steals the diamond from him. After completing his job, Moscow Chikna kills Rocky and flees. The story then twists to another underworld don, JD (Zakir Hussain) also has his eyes on the stolen diamond. To steal the diamond from Moscow Chikna, JD sends a team of foolish robbers, including Raja (Shahid Kapoor), Tina (Ayesha Takia), Chobey (Paresh Rawal) and an dimwit pilot Puttu (Johnny Lever). As they fail to rob the diamond, they witness Moscow Chikna being murdered by an unknown gangster named Gunmaster G9. They manage to steal the diamond, but refuse to hand it over to JD. They escape from JD's trap, who then sends out gangsters looking for the four idiots. To get them out of trouble, comes Raja's uncle Munna (Sunny Deol), who is also added to JD's wanted list. On top of all this, a bankrupt gambler Luckee (Vivek Oberoi) is stalking Munna to make him fight in a boxing match. Between all this confusion, the question is, who will get the diamond?
