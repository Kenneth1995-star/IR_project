The Calendar

After losing his money at the races, a racehorse owner's (John McCallum) fianc√©e (Greta Gynt) jilts him and marries a Lord (Raymond Lovell). Whilst drowning his sorrows, the racehorse owner becomes involved in a big-race scandal. The plot is to steal his own prize horse before a race, therefore increasing the odds in another big race, the Ascot Gold Cup. Can he successfully recoup his fortune and also win again in the romantic stakes?
