Shahrukh Bola "Khoobsurat Hai Tu"

Laali (Preetika Chawla) is one of the biggest fans of Shah Rukh Khan in the city. She believes that one day she will meet him in person and be his heroine, although for now she sells flowers by the road to make money for her family, brother (Menon), and boyfriend (Afzaal). One day, while selling flowers, she stops near a car when she hears a voice asking for some flowers. She goes over and finds Khan in the front seat. She nearly faints, but Khan grabs her and says "Khoobsurat Hai Tu" ("You are Beautiful"). Nobody believes her, and her efforts to prove that she met him form the rest of the story.
