Angels

Hameem Hyder (Indrajith) is a brilliant police officer in the Special Armed Police Department. He does his work efficiently but is an egoist to some extent. Due to external pressures, he is forced to step aside from a case he has been dealing with. He is offended by this and wants to take revenge on those behind forcing his recusal.
His earlier crime investigation becomes the focus of the reality crime show Views 24x7, and it is at this juncture that priest Varghese Punnyalan (Joy Mathew) and Journalist Haritha Menon (Asha Sarath) enter his life. Both of them want to know about Haider and his earlier investigations, but their interests are unrelated and have different motivations. In their attempts to attain their goal, each becomes aware of the other and the resulting conflict builds the rest of the story line.
