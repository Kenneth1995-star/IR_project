Mr. Six

Mr. Six tells of a 50-or-so-year-old street punk called “Mr. Six” who has reigned over the Beijing streets as the neighbourhood kingpin for many years. One day, he comes to know his son Xiaobo is in dispute with a well-connected young drag-racing street gang leader, Xiaofei. Mr. Six steps up to help defend him. He attempts to settle the debts of his son by relying on his old school rules and by the help of his old friends. Though things don't go as expected, Mr. Six and his son are in deep trouble. Meanwhile, he is diagnosed with coronary artery disease. In his attempt to standby his principle, he wages war against the opposing group. Mr. Six's old gang members who are in different places come to join with him. In the end, the son is shown well and running an open-bar as he promised. His gang members are bailed out from jail by their own group influence. The opposing gang members leader is heard through the news as arrested. Mr. Six is shown no more.[9]
