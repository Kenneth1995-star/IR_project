Naruto the Movie 3: The Animal Riot of Crescent Moon Island

Naruto Uzumaki, Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno and Rock Lee are assigned to protect prince Hikaru Tsuki and his father Michiru.
While heading to the wealthy crescent shape island called the Land of the Moon, the group arrive to claim the circus, where Hikaru befriends the rare sabertoothed tiger Chamu. After meeting Michiru's ex-wife Amayo, Naruto saves Hikaru and Chamu from the storm. The group arrive at the island, where self-proclaimed king Shabadaba betray them. Korega helps the group escape from the castle to the cave, where they mourn for Hikaru's grandfather Kakeru. At the shore, the group encounter three Shabadaba's assistants, who kidnap and bring Michiru back to the castle, where Shabadaba declares himself to be the wealthiest person himself. The group use the circus to infiltrate the palace and fight many soldiers in the courtyard. As Sakura and Lee defeat Kong≈ç and Karenbana, Naruto and Hikaru save Michiru from falling to his death. After Ishidate petrifies Shadabada, Naruto uses the Crescent Moon Rasengan to defeat Ishidate.
While Michiru becomes the king of the island, Naruto, Kakashi, Sakura and Lee return home.
