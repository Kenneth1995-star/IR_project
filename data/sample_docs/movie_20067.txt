Burke & Hare

In Edinburgh in the 1820s, surgeon Dr Knox (Harry Andrews) employs graverobbers Burke and Hare (Derren Nesbitt and Glynn Edwards) to supply fresh corpses for his anatomical lectures at the medical academy. When graveyard supplies run low, the industrious pair turn to murder to keep the business going.
