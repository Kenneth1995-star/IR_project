Handa and Bhonda

Handa (Mithun) is a simple, sincere and hardworking person, but his honesty even lands him in trouble sometimes, created by his not-so-perfect colleagues and his own boss (Biswajit). Handa's son, Bhonda (Aritra), is exactly opposite to his father's character isn't. He is a brat. He steals his father's money, flunks his unit tests, gets punished every day in school, also copies his father's signature in the progress report card, bunks classes and even hits on his most beautiful classmate, Medha. Both hate their life as it is troubled and they are looking for a miracle to happen. Handa wishes if he could become a kid again to help teach Bhonda what education could do to an individual. Bhonda, wishes to grow up to teach his father a lesson. Both their wishes come true.
