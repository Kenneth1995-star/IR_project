Pinky Palkar (Deepika Padukone) is an aspiring skater who dreams of making it big through a television show. She is the archetypical Mumbai chawl girl who dreams big, despite her lowly surroundings.[7] Her dreams goes away when One-Shot-Nandu (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a fighter who pummels his opponents in the ring blindfolded, knocks her down in a freak car accident, making her blind.[8] Despite her handicap, Pinky is determined to participate in the show. Full of remorse, Nandu trains her to "see" through her blindness, using her other senses. In return, she teaches him to skate and Nandu becomes her partner in the competition. They gradually fall in love.
