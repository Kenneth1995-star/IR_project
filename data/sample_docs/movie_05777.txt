Woman in the Dark

At their parents' 40th-anniversary celebration are the Morello brothers, priest Tony, lawyer Phil and wayward Gino, whose comments offend Phil's new fiancee, Evelyn.
Gino wants to join gangster Nick Petzik's organization. Petzik plots a jewel heist, after which Gino's lawyer brother, who represents the insurance company, can be blackmailed into fencing the stolen gems if he doesn't want Gino implicated in the crime.
Anna Reichardt, a young woman in love with Phil, is concerned. After the robbery, and Gino's admission to Phil that he was in on it, Phil decides to turn the tables on the crooks and recover both the jewels and the insurance cash. He neglects Evelyn, who breaks off their engagement. Petzik's thugs gain revenge by shooting Gino, but just when Phil is about to be killed, too, Anna arrives with the police.
