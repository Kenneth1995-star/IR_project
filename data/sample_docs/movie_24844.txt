Gomti Ke Kinare

Sameer lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay with his mother, Ganga, and maternal uncle, Nekiram. Nekiram works at a petrol pump, and his mother paints pictures and statuettes of Hindu deities. Sameer grows up, becomes an Engineer, and lands a job with Khosla Enterprises, which is run by Chairman Gopaldas Khosla, where he proves his abilities and is soon promoted as Chief Engineer, and gets a bungalow to live in as well as a fancy car. He meets with Roshni, the daughter of Gopaldas, both fall in love, and soon get engaged. His idyllic lifestyle is shattered when a rival businessman, Chaganmal, alleges that Sameer's mother was actually Gangabai, a Lucknow-based Courtesan, who was never married, and that Nekiram is not his maternal uncle.[5]
