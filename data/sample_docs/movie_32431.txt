She is good at speaking Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil. She happens to see Chakri (Allari Naresh), accidentally who is a good singer but not a professional one. Chakri falls in her love and the response from other side also comes good. But Chakri has a peculiar profession that gets revealed amidst the movie. That is carrying the old and disabled on his back for climbing the hill which is the abode of a goddess.
But eventually, Indu happens to encounter a rich man (Sharath Babu) that turns her life. The major twist in the story appears there. Who is that rich man? The story goes like this. He had a grand daughter by name Sindhu who looks perfectly like Indu. Sindhu dies in an acid attack followed by ragging and hence when he sees the look-alike of his grand daughter in Indu, he follows her. What happens later becomes rest of the movie in this confused story line.
