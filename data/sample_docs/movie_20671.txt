The Big Swap

A group of friends meet and plan to swap partners for one night. Every man brings his car key and they all throw it in a bunch of bowl and mix it up. Then the women picks up blindfolded one of the car keys and has to spend a night with whoever's owner of that car key. It's all fun and games at first, but after the party they all begin to regret their choices and the direction of their lives.
