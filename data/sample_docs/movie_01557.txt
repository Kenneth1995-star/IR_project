Meet the Baron

A couple of bunglers (Jimmy Durante and Jack Pearl) are abandoned in the jungles of Africa by Baron Munchausen. A rescue team mistake Pearl for the missing Baron, and take the two of them back to America where they receive a hero's welcome.
The phony Baron is invited to speak at Cuddle College, run by Dean Primrose (Edna May Oliver). There he falls for Zasu Pitts and meets three crazy janitors (The Three Stooges), and faces exposure as a fraud.
