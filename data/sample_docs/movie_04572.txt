Trail Street

The town of Liberal in southwestern Kansas needs the help of a lawman; so does the law-abiding land baron Allen Harper. Deputy Billy Burns hence sends for his longtime friend, the legendary Bat Masterson.
Allen's sweetheart, Susan Pritchard, is pursued by Logan Maury, a corrupt cattleman. Hired gun Lance Larkin, who works for Maury, beats up a farmer until Bat arrives and throws him in jail. Bat is appointed the town's marshal and appoints Billy as his deputy.
Ruby Stone, a saloon singer in love with Maury, tries to keep him away from good girl Susan. When a farmer is murdered, Allen is framed and faces a lynch mob. Ruby ends up betraying Maury and gets shot in the back. Maury's own men are offended by the death of Ruby and gun down Maury. Allen can now marry Susan, while the town makes Billy the new marshal as Bat rides away.
