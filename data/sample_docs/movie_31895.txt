Ashoka Chakravarthy

Vedam Venkata Ashok (Nandamuri Balakrishna) belongs to orthodox traditional Brahmin works as a priest in a temple. Urmila (Bhanupriya) and Ashok is in love. But Urmila's father Shanmukha Sastry (Gollapudi Maruti Rao) has betrayed Ashok's father Vedam (J. V. Somayajulu) and is trying to adopt their whole property pushing them down to below poverty line. Adiseshayya (Narra Venkateswara Rao) and Shanmukha Sastry had planned together and have declared Ashok as a thief and had sent him to jail. After returning from jail, Ashok's father had restricted him to enter the house. Ashok has now decided to go to any safe place and earn a lot of money due to which he can again be held up his family's pride. In this situation, he comes across Karim Sahab (Satyanarayana) in Bombay and gets involved in illegal and corrupt activities in the city. By doing all this Ashok turns as Ashoka Chakravarthy and earns lots of money but will he be able to regain his parents' confidence and their love, for whom he had jumped into such a trouble.[3]
