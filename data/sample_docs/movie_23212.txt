Final Victory

Triad leader Big Bo (Tsui Hark) is a violent man, but his younger brother Hung (Eric Tsang) is a nice guy with a light personality who fusses around him. Even once when Hung's girlfriend was taken, his brother stood up for him.
Bo committed a crime and was sentenced to prison for six months. Before he went to prison, Bo entrusted Hung to take care of his two lovers Ping (Margaret Lee) and Mimi (Loletta Lee). Hung becomes involved in a dispute between Ping and loan sharks. Later Hung and Ping also rushes to Japan and look for Mimi, who is also in a sticky situation herself. Hung beats his brain out to help them get out of trouble, while also preventing them from finding out each other's identity. After the three return to Hong Kong, Ping and Mimi discovers each other's identity as Bo's mistress. Ping cries but was restrained by Bo. While waiting for Bo's release, Hung and Mimi fall in love, but because of this, he cannot face his brother, which becomes a burden that he cannot resolve.
