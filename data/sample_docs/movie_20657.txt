In a working class South London district lives Raymond, his wife, Valerie, her brother, Billy, Valerie and Billy's, mother, Janet, and their grandmother, Kathy. Billy is a drug addict, and Raymond kicks him out when he steals drugs from him. Billy hangs out with his heroin addict friends and they shoot up together. The family is dysfunctional, mostly due to Raymond's fiery-temper and violent outbursts. When Valerie gets pregnant again, she continues to smoke and drink.
Valerie goes out on the town, and when Ray sees an attractive male friend of hers, he flys into a jealous rage, ordering her out of the pub and into the car. Back home, he accuses her of sleeping with the male friend, and pummels her to a pulp, causing her to miscarry. He tries to win her back, but she leaves him and prepares to start a new life without him. In an alcohol-fuelled rage, he angrily tears their flat apart. He tells his friend that the reason for his horrible behavior is his own abusive father, who was the same way with him and his mother. She is outraged, and says that when she reaches 70, she wants to look back on this part of her life, a she is now 30, as a time when she had some fun. What she has instead is people feeling sorry for her.
Valerie doesn't want to return to Ray, pointing out they haven't got a home to go back to because he's smashed it all up. She will try and find someone to be with that will love her and treat her kindly. Ray goes to see Valerie and asks her if she still loves him. Ray and Valerie are eventually back together again, and Ray has fixed up the apartment but apeaks as crudely as ever. Billy, and his friend Danny, rob a man to support their drug habit and wind up going to prison. This reunites not only Ray with Valerie, but re-unites the whole family.
