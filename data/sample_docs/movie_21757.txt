Scottie Templeton is a show-business veteran, based in New York and well known in the theatrical community there. He has many acquaintances, but is divorced from his wife and estranged from his only son.
Scottie learns that he has leukemia and is dying. His ex-wife Maggie, in town for a school reunion, comes to visit and reflect on their time together. Scottie makes an effort to reconnect with his son, Jud, who still has anger issues. A young actress Scottie once dated, Sally Haines, strikes Scottie as someone who might be a good romantic match for his son. As a testimonial dinner is organized in Scottie's honor, he attempts to repair some of his past relationships in the time he has left.
