Thamarai

According to the prophecy, Kali temple has to be shifted in Madurai Veeran temple's place. This prophecy creates troubles between the two communities of the village. In the meantime, Thamarai (Napoleon) comes back from jail to help the "Madurai Veeran" community against the vicious village chief Subbarayan (Rajesh).
Five years back, a brute Thamarai came to Subbarayan's village. Being short-tempered, he clashed against the ruthless Subbarayan many times. Thamarai and Poogodai fell in love with each other but the poor palm wine seller Sarasu (Rupini) developed a soft corner for Thamarai. Poogodai later got married with a rich groom and Thamarai went to jail for cutting the hand of the groom's father. The next day, the groom committed suicide.
During the Madurai Veeran temple festival, Subbarayan plans to demolish the Madurai Veeran temple but Thamarai prevents it. In the confrontation, Sarasu died by saving Thamarai. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
