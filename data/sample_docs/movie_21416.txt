Appropriate Behaviour

Brooklynite Shirin, the daughter of well-off Persian immigrants, is left homeless and jobless after her girlfriend Maxine breaks up with her. With the encouragement of her friend Crystal she moves in with strange roommates and gets a new job teaching 5 year old Park Slope children the art of movie making.
Shirin's parents are confused as to why Shirin moved out of her old apartment as Shirin has never told them she was bisexual and dating a woman. Determined to get her life back on track, Shirin begins trying to follow Maxine, hoping to rekindle their relationship. After seeing Maxine is now dating Tibet, a fellow teacher at the Park Slope school where she works, Shirin realizes that they are never going to get back together. She devotes herself to her work and comes out to her brother, who is mostly supportive, and her mother, who is in denial.
On the subway, Shirin tells Crystal that she again plans to bring up the issue of her sexuality with her mother in a month. She sees Maxine outside the subway car on the platform and the two women wave goodbye to one another.
