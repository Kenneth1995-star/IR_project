Gyan (Mazhar Khan) and Rasik (Chandra Mohan) are good friends and when Gyan has to go to Africa for work, he leaves his wife Shobha (Sardar Akhtar) in care of Rasik and his wife Rambha (Maya Devi). Rasik has always liked Shobha but kept silent about it. Rambha goes to her parents' home, leaving Rasik and Shobha alone in the house. Rasik gives in to his feelings with Shobha being a willing participant. Soon Shobha gives birth to a daughter (Indira) whom Gyan believes to be his child. Rasik and Shobha are shocked when Gyan decides on an alliance between Indira and Rasik's son Madan seeing the close relationship they share.
