The plot centers on an American pilot, played by Paul Kersey, who also starred in Feng Xiaoning's 1997 Red River Valley, a film which depicted the British invasion of Tibet in 1905. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the American pilot makes a forced landing near the Great Wall in North China but is taken into the care of the Communist guerilla forces. He meets and falls in love with a young woman fighter who had been raped by the Japanese invaders. The American returns to the Yellow River after the opening of China in the 1980s.[2]
