And Soon the Darkness

Jane (Pamela Franklin) and Cathy (Michele Dotrice) are two young nurses from Nottingham, taking a cycling holiday in rural France. When they stop at a busy cafe, Jane wants to plan their route, but Cathy is more interested in a handsome man (Sandor Elès), whom she spies drinking alone at the next table. Later, as Jane and Cathy make their way along a quiet country road, the man, who rides a Lambretta scooter, overtakes them, and they pass him a few minutes later, as he rests by a cemetery gate. Cathy becomes intrigued by him.
Stopping for a rest, Cathy decides she wants to sunbathe for a while, but Jane wants to push on. Eventually they argue, and Jane decides to carry on alone.
A short while later, at a lonely café, the owner tries to tell Jane, in poor English, that the area has a bad reputation. She begins to reconsider her decision, and heads back to the spot where she left Cathy earlier, unaware that something has already happened.
Unable to find her friend, and increasingly concerned about the presence of the scooter rider, Jane decides to look for the local police officer (John Nettleton). Jane becomes convinced that the Lambretta rider, who is called Paul, and who says he is a plain-clothes detective from the Sûreté in Paris, is Cathy's attacker. She escapes from him – in the process discovering Cathy's dead body – and re-encounters the policeman, who is then revealed as Cathy's murderer. He attacks Jane but is stopped by Paul, who knocks him unconscious.
