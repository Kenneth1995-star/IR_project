The Human Factor

Maurice Castle (Nicol Williamson) is a mid-level bureaucrat in MI6 whose life seems completely without peculiarity, peccadillo, or any quality to suggest he’s anything but a dull bureaucrat, except for the interesting, casually introduced detail that he has an African wife, Sarah (Iman), and son, Sam (Gary Forbes). Meanwhile, the company regime, represented by corpulent, bluffly cheery Dr. Percival (Robert Morley), who’s actually an expert in assassinations and biological toxins, and éminence grise, Sir John Hargreaves (Richard Vernon), advise newly appointed security chieftain Daintry (Richard Attenborough), they believe they have a traitor at the MI6 African desk. The duo determine the mole must be quietly killed, rather than be allowed publicity in a trial or a flight to Moscow. They determine quickly the most likely candidate for the traitor is Arthur Davis (Derek Jacobi), Castle’s playboy office partner.
In actuality, Castle is the mole, but the information he leaks is entirely unimportant financial documents. He became involved in leaking to the Soviets when he was an MI6 agent in South Africa, seven years earlier: he met and fell in love with Sarah, and when their affair was discovered by the authorities, Castle was all but thrown out of the country, and he entrusted Sarah’s smuggling out of the country to a mutual communist acquaintance. Ever since, he’s been repaying the favor by filtering insignificant data to the Soviets. Castle makes one last informational drop to his communist handlers and is summarily whisked off to Moscow for protection. However, Castle's primary problem is he is not a communist, nor a sympathizer, of any kind. His only interest is in his wife and son, who are left in London — where they remain separated from him.[3]
