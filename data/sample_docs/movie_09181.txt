Posse

Howard Nightingale (Kirk Douglas), a U.S. marshal, leads an elite uniformed posse to track down and capture the infamous train robber Jack Strawhorn (Bruce Dern), in an effort to further his political career when running for United States Senator. Strawhorn disrupts his plans when he kidnaps Nightingale. He demands a ransom of $40,000 from the posse for Nightingale's safe return—the same amount of money that the posse burned when tracking Strawhorn down and killing his gang. In order to raise the money, Nightingale's posse have to rob the town, thus turning the public against Nightingale.
