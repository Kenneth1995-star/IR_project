In My End Is My Beginning

Jung-ha (Uhm Jung-hwa) is left alone and heartbroken after her husband Jae-in (Hwang Jung-min) dies in a car accident. Her grief sharpens when she learns after his death that he had been cheating on her with her friend Na-ru (Kim Hyo-jin). As a novelist, Jae-in had been looking for new stimulation to rouse him from his boring routine, and the secrecy and risk of his affair with Na-ru inspired his work. After Jae-in's funeral, Na-ru goes to Jung-ha, begging for forgiveness, saying that she will do anything if only Jung-ha will let her stay at her house. Jung-ha refuses at first, but eventually they begin living together. The strange co-habitation arrangement between Jung-ha and Na-ru and its complicated web of love, hate, lust, and guilt, develops into a lesbian relationship, leading to a new way of life.[5][6]
