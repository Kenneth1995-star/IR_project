The Night My Number Came Up

A senior Royal Air Force officer (Michael Redgrave) is at a dinner party in Hong Kong at which one of those present (Michael Hordern), a naval Commander, talks about a dream he had in which the Air Marshal and a group of 5 other companions were flying from Bangkok in a Dakota which crashed on a rocky shore. The Air Marshal is due to fly to Tokyo the following day but is not disturbed because many of the details differ from his planned voyage, including using a different kind of aircraft, a Consolidated Liberator.
When problems ground the planned aircraft, a Dakota airliner - like the one seen in the dream - is substituted, and a number of other passengers arrive to make the total number of people on board 13 (8 passengers and 5 crew members), the same number of people in the dream. As the flight proceeds, other circumstances change so that eventually most of the details correspond to the dream. However, instead of crashing, the pilot manages to bring the aircraft down in a controlled emergency landing in a snowfield in the mountains and all on board survive.
