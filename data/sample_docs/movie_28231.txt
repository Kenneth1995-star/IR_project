Collector

Avinash Varma (Suresh Gopi) is the District Collector of Ernakulam. He takes on several anti-social elements who rule the underworld of Kochi . Of them, Williams (Adithya Menon), who is a real estate businessman is his biggest opponent. ACP Revathy and social activist Arundhati are there to support Avinash Varma. The City Police Commissioner, the Lady Mayor Sethulakshmi (Mohini) of Kochi Corporation and a couple of corrupt ministers and officials are supporting the illegal activities of Williams. In the age-old battle between the 'Good' and the 'Evil', Avinash Varma wins as expected, and his truth and honesty rewarded.
