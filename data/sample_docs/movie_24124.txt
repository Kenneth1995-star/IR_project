Rocky

Rocky is a goon from Mumbai and does anything for money. He is on a mission and constantly runs away from the police. Everyone relates to him as a 'chameleon' who constantly changes colors. Rocky finally reaches Kashmir and meets Nandini, he instantly falls in love with her. Rocky rescue Nandini while being kidnapped by terrorists. Later Rocky finds that Nandini is already engaged to Avik. Avik is a goon (and the minister's son) but Nandini doesn't know that. When Nandini found out that Avik is a goon, she dumped him. And she also come to know that she is in love with Rocky. Later on Rocky kills Avik and the minister. One day when Rocky, Nandini, and Diya (Nandini's friend) go to the temple, Diya sees Rocky killing someone. And then there is a flashback about how he and Nandini met before but she lost her memory. That happened because Nandini's brother was an undercover cop and when goons found out they killed the whole family. The only one who survived was Nandini but she had a bullet in her head. The doctors said that she would lose her memory soon. So, she tells Rocky to kill the people who killed her family because she had seen Rocky beating up a bunch of people. In the end Rocky kills all the goons who killed Nandini's family.[2]
