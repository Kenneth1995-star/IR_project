Baton Baton Mein

Rosie Perreira (Pearl Padamsee) is an overly anxious widow, living with her violin-obsessed son, Shabi (Ranjit Chowdhry) and a lovely daughter, Nancy (Tina Munim) who she would like to get married to a wealthy young man. Her brother and neighbour, Tom (David) introduces a young eligible Tony Braganza (Amol Palekar) to Nancy on the 9:10 AM Western Railway local train from Bandra to Churchgate. Tom also asks Nancy to introduce Tony to Rosie, which she does. Rosie is initially apprehensive about him as he only drawing a mere Rs.300/ compared to Nancy's Rs.700/-, but soon changes her mind when she finds out that after his probationary period he will draw a monthly pay of Rs.1000/-. Nancy and Tony are permitted to meet and both eventually fall in love. While Nancy has a past where she was betrayed by a boy whom she loved, she still likes Tony. Tony is hesitant, and this is what costs him Nancy's love, as Rosie feels that he will not come through with the marriage. And soon Rosie starts looking elsewhere for a son-in-law. Nancy does not like this, but she at first accepts whatever her mom wants. Nancy and Tony have a fight and stop meeting each other on the train as well. When Tom comes to know about this, he speaks to Tony's dad. Tony's dad tells Tony that if he is still reluctant to make any commitments, he should tell Nancy about it. So Nancy and Tony meet each other and Nancy tells him that she will never meet him again. It is then that Tony feels that he actually loves Nancy and cannot live without her. Then Nancy also confesses her love for him and they get married happily.
