Avakai Biryani

Avakai Biryani (Pickeled Biryani) is a coming of age story of two individuals from two completely different backgrounds and cultural upbringing. The only similarity between them is the fact that they both belong to the same picturesque, historic town of Devarakonda, about 100Â km from Hyderabad city.
Akbar, an orphan Muslim is an auto driver, whose days are all about lugging passengers from one town to another on the highway. But driving an auto is not all he wants to do. He wants more in life. His goal is to pass his final year B.com examinations, something he has failed to do now three times in a row.
Lakshmi, a traditional Brahmin girl, resettled with her family in Devarakonda, having been displaced from Polavaram. Her family used to traditionally run a hotel over there for many years. Her aim now is to be able to open up a hotel on the highway near Devarakonda and make it a success. She also takes a lot of pride in the avakai (mango pickle) she makes and has big plans of selling them in Hyderabad.
While these central characters go about their goals, the town of Devarakonda itself has a lot of things going on: the village panchayat which seldom takes care of its own people, a thriving 7 seater auto business run corruptly, with the conspirators in this case being two influential people in the town.
Akbar and Lakshmi become friends after first being apprehensive about each other's faiths and backgrounds. They respect each other's dreams and ambitions, which much later turns into a mature loving relationship.
The goings on in the town compel Akbar to take a stand on certain issues. He becomes an accidental hero, but what happens to his relationship with Lakshmi? How much further can it go? Her father is uncompromising in his attitude towards Muslims. The couple takes a decision.
