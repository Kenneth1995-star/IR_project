Mallika

Whenever she closes her eyes, all Sanjana sees are a variety of ghosts staring at her in various states of blood and gore. When she awakens she can see them lying by her side.
Unable to sleep, she can feel that somewhere is a desolate mansion where a murder has taken place and she needs to find out who and why. Her boyfriend is of no help only providing some background music when the going gets tough.[4]
