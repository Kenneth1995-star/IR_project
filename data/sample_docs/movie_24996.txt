Ab Kya Hoga

The story revolves around Ram Sinha, who meets a girl named Chitralekha while on a train journey. She disappears suddenly from a moving train and thereafter he meets her on various occasions, in circumstances that make him believe that she is a spirit or a ghost. He then discovers that his mother has fixed his marriage with the same girl, and though he goes through with the ceremony, he refuses to accept her as his wife. Chitralekha's ghost/spirit leads him to various life-threatening situations, from which he escapes. Eventually, Ram is killed in a jeep accident, after which it is revealed that his best friend Rajesh had conspired behind his back to cheat him of his wealth. The ghost was a well tutored accomplice who wore a mask that made her look like his betrothed and poisoned Ram's mind against her. The final denouement comes when Ram reappears and reveals that he had faked his death with the help of the Police and his doctor, so as to bring the culprits to the book.
