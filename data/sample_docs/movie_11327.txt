Warlock

The Warlock is taken captive in Boston, Massachusetts in 1691 by the witch-hunter Giles Redferne. He is sentenced to death for his activities, including the death of Redferne's wife, but before the execution, Satan appears and propels the Warlock forward in time to late 20th century Los Angeles, California. Redferne follows through the portal.
The Warlock attempts to reassemble The Grand Grimoire, a Satanic book that will reveal the "true" name of God and thus allow him to unmake all of creation. Redferne and the Warlock then embark on a cat-and-mouse chase with the Grand Grimoire and Kassandra, a waitress who encounters Giles attempting to use a "witch compass" to track the Warlock. Explaining some basic rules of the Warlock, such as their weakness to purified salt, Kassandra follows Giles, as the Warlock has cursed her with an aging spell after taking her bracelet.
The Warlock assembles two-thirds of the Grimoire; and Giles is stunned to learn that the last portion is buried in his grave, buried off of church lands under the cursed sign of a witch. The Warlock appears and starts a ritual to reassemble the Grimoire. After seeing the name of God appear on the book, The Warlock is about to call it out and unmake existence when Kassandra, a diabetic, injects two needles filled with saltwater into his neck, and he bursts into flames. Redferne thanks Kassandra and returns to his own time. In the epilogue, Kassandra is seen burying the Grimoire in the Bonneville Salt Flats.
