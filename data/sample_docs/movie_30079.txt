Veeramani

The film begins with the murder of a scientist. The superintendent of police Veeramani (Prem Menon) finally catches the culprit. During the enquiry, the culprit Gautham (Babloo Prithiveeraj) reveals everything. Gautham was in fact a talented sprinter but jobless, he needed money for his father's surgery. So Shaktiman (Prakash) hired him to kill the scientist. Shaktiman is the leader of a terrorist group and he is also a fake swamy. In the meantime, the journalist Rakeswari (Yuvarani) falls in love with Veeramani. The rest of the film is a cat-and-mouse game between Shaktiman and Veeramani.
