Akash (Dev) and Barsha (Koyel Mullick) met just by mere accident at Metropolish Fame Mall. Akash fell in love with Barsha instantly. However he lost contact with Barsha and could not track her address by any means. He was visiting a marriage ceremony of the daughter of his momâ€™s friend and to his surprise, he found the bride was Barsha herself.
