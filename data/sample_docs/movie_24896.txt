Namak Haraam

The story focuses on two friends, Somu (Rajesh Khanna) and Vicky (Amitabh Bachchan). To avenge the fact that Vicky is insulted by the union leader of his factory, Somu infiltrates the factory as a worker and later the trade union as its leader. However, Somu is moved by the plight of the workers and is influenced by their ideals, which leads to a confrontation between the two friends. This story concentrates on the rise of unions with the backdrop of Mumbai's textile mills and inflation in the early 1970s.
