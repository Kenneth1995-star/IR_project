Ravi Kant (Sunil Dutt) is a doctor who lives in New York with his wife Anuradha (Smita Patil), also a doctor. Anuradha is doing research into leukemia. Ravi is nostalgic about India and decides to return there when he receives an offer for a position as the head of surgery from Tata Memorial Hospital in Bombay. Anuradha wants to continue her research and does not want to go to India. Ravi returns to India after a divorce with Anuradha. Anuradha discovers that she is pregnant with Ravi's child but Ravi is unaware of the fact. In India, while treating one of his patients Bhardwaj, he meets his daughter Asha (Reena Roy). Just before his death, Bhardwaj is promised by Ravi that he will marry Asha. Asha and Ravi are married. Asha dies while giving birth to their daughter (Khushboo). Soon after Khushboo's eleventh birthday, she is diagnosed with leukemia. On a recommendation from a fellow doctor at Tata Memorial, Ravi takes her to a hospital in New York City where Anuradha is her doctor. To cure her cancer, Khushboo must have a bone marrow transplant from a donor with matching blood group and genes. Shashi (Anuradha's son) is found to have a perfect match and he donates the marrow. Ravi discovers that Shashi is the son of him and Anuradha. In the final scene, everyone comes together at the airport when Ravi, Khusboo and Shashi are coming to India. Anuradha joins them as well.
