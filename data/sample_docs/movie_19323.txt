Interpol

Charles Sturgis (Victor Mature) is an FBI agent on the trail of a drug smuggling operation, following his quarry all over the Continent. The criminal mastermind Frank McNally (Trevor Howard) is something of a lunatic, who has already strangled Mature's sister to death just for the hell of it. Gina Broger (Anita Ekberg) is Frank's luscious courier.[4]
