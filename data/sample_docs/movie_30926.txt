Guru En Aalu

Guru (Madhavan) wants to be an MD for a company under his boss Krishna (Abbas). Krishna is a successful entrepreneur married to Sheila. But the major problem for Krishna is his playboy nature. Guru hopes that his boss will make him an MD so he tries to do everything to please him.
Krishna falls for a model, Seema (Mamta Mohandas) whom Guru also fancies. But coming to know that his boss is interested, he decides to give up on his feelings for her so as to achieve his career goals. His boss asks him to help him woo Seema, and Guru follows his every order. But after a sequence of events, he realises that he cannot forget his feelings for Seema. He soon starts to purposefully sabotage Krishna's attempts of becoming closer to Seema. Whether Seema feels the same way about Guru, or Krishna wins her heart forms the rest of the story.
