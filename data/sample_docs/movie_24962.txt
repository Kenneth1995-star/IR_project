Vandana

An orphan girl, named Bindu is trapped in a web of deceit and crime that imprisons her in shackles. Expressive as in her other films, events take her through life's journey in a tale that is not quite regular Bombay potboiler. For one, there is a rare use of boats, the 28 metre Pamela (a cabin cruiser) and a couple of dinghies with outboards.
