Stuck with the nickname "Dreadnought", Dickie Marchant (Brian Rix) feels he has no choice but to pursue a career as a boxer. However, to mollify his uncle (Leo Franklyn), Rix pretends to be the soul of religiosity, while his tough-talking manager, Walter 'Wally' Burton (William Hartnell), poses as a man of the cloth.
