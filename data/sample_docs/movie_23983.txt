The Sanyals are a large extended family composed of the nonagenarian grandfather, (Haradhan Banerjee), his son (Ranjit Mallick), daughter-in-law (Laboni Sarkar) who rules over the house like a female Hitler, reincarnated, and their children of whom two, a daughter (Koel Mallick) and son (Rishi Kaushik) live together in a beautiful mansion in Bhawanipur. There seems to be more servants in their house than family members, extending the virtues and parameters of the ideal ‘joint’ family. The film starts with everyone being excited about the return of the elder son (Babul Supriyo) from US, where he had gone for some business related work. However, all hell breaks loose, when he returns with a wife (Rituparna Sengupta) and her child from a former marriage in tow. Her first husband with underworld links was killed in police crossfire. Everyone accepts the new additions to the Sanyal family except the mother-in-law who refuses to even acknowledge her presence. The story revolves around how these two women build bridges to keep the joint family intact, with most of the credit going to the beautiful daughter-in-law who can sing, dance, cook, clean, supervise, nurse and even do matchmaking in her own way – in short, being politically appropriate and offering a perfect celluloid example of a matrimonial ‘bride wanted’ classified ad.
