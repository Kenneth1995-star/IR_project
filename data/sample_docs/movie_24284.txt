Ghar Sansar a.k.a. Homelife

Devi Prasad (Mazhar Khan) lives with his virtuous wife Taramati (Sardar Akhtar) called "Bhabhi" by everyone, and with his younger brother Sundar (Nazir). Though not well off financially, both husband and the wife go through sacrifices to educate Sundar to become a lawyer. The bond between Bhabhi and Sundar is shown as warm and sincere.
Gopalji, who cheated Devi Prasad's father of his money is now eager to have his college-going daughter Lata (Jehanara Kajjan) marry Suraj. The families agree but Sundar refuses for what Gopalji had done to his father. Sundar and Lata meet at a college picnic without realising their family connections and soon fall in love. Following his graduation, Sundar becomes a lawyer. He is reconciled to marrying the girl chosen for him by his brother but on discovering who the girl is after marriage, he is happy. Lata in spite of her rich background adjusts in Sundarâ€™s house being respectful of Bhabhi and the older brother.
Kishori, a young friend of Lata's, enters this family equation and with her cunning ways she brings about disruption in Bhabhi and Lata's relationship by insinuating that Bhabhi wants the full ownership of the house. With the mis-understandings that arise, Devi Prasad, who had left his job on Sundar's insistence when he became a lawyer, realises that he is now dependent on Sundar for subsistence. However, when a particularly nasty row is created by Lata, Sundar slaps his Bhabhi. Deviprasad leaves the house with his wife and young daughter. Lata soon comes to her senses and sees the way she has been manipulated by Kishori. She catches Kishori flirting with Sundar and a fight starts. Devi Prasad who has come to give back some possessions gets involved, and falls down from the top floor and dies. When Sundar is accused of murdering his brother, Bhabhi arrives to acquit him.
