Mahakavi Kalidasu

The Avanti king (Lingamurthy) refuses to give his daughter Vidyadhari (Sriranjani) in marriage to his minister Hariharamathyuduâ€™s (K.V.S. Sarma) son and asks him instead to find a scholarly bridegroom for his artist daughter. The villainous minister brings the illiterate sheppard Kaludu (ANR) passing him off as a great scholar, currently on a mission to promote the colloquial language. After the marriage, Vidyadhari learns she has been cheated. She laments before the family deity Kali and faints. Fearing for her life, Kaludu prays and Goddess Kali (Vasanthi) appears before him and grants a boon that he will acquire new knowledge. Kaludu forgets his past, assumes a new name Kalidasa, a Sanskrit scholar, earns kudos for his works from the kings and finally lands in the court of Bhoja Raja (SVR) who shows great admiration and respect for him. But this irks the self-proclaimed poet laureate Kavi Rakshasa (CSR) who plots to defame Kalidasa who stays at the ashram of Bharatacharya (P. Suribabu). But all his ploys turn against him. The court dancer Vilasavati (Rajasulocahana) falls in love with Kalidasa. Meanwhile, Vidyadhari searching for her husband comes to the city of Dhaara. Kalidasa fails to recognize her. Saved from a suicide attempt by Bhattacharya's disciples, Vidyadhari stays at the ashram determined to win back her husband. How Kalidasa recollects his past and unites with his wife forms the climax.
