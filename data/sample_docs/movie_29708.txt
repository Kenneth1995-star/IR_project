Mangamma Sapatham

Ashok (Kamalhassan) is raised to be a stuttering, frightened coward by his cruel uncle Bhoopathy (Satyaraj). When Mangamma (Sujatha) and her cohorts learn that he is unmarried, she works her way into his mother's heart and marries him. But when she learns about his ill-treatment at the hands of his uncle, his plight changes her heart and she decides to stay on. But Bhoopathy reveals her initial plan of absconding with the money and drives her out. When Ashok runs to join her, Bhoopathy kills him. Mangamma is thought to be dead but she survives and raises her son Raja (Kamal again) to be a fearless young man well-versed in fighting, dancing, etc. Once he learns the story, he, along with his girlfriend Radha (Madhavi), settles scores with Bhoopathy and his son Jaipal (Nalinikanth).
