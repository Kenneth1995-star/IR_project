Tamanna Sahni (Shilpa Shetty) is a creative head of a top advertising agency called T.J. Associates. Her dedication, ideas, designs, and hard work have mainly contributed to the success of the agency. She leaves for a college reunion and meets her college sweetheart Rohit Manchanda (Salman Khan). They rekindle their love for each other and share some intimate moments together. Eventually Rohit leaves and Tamanna settles back into her usual routine.
When her sister, Tanya (Kamalinee Mukherjee), meets with an accident she decides to donate her blood. However her doctor, Dr. Raisingh (Revathi), informs her of testing positive for HIV. Tamanna's world turns upside down and she desperately tries to get into contact with Rohit but in vain.
The news of Tamanna having HIV is soon spread around the office and she loses her job. Angered by her unfair dismissal she searches for a lawyer to fight her case. Unfortunately there is no law in India concerned with such cases and all lawyers refuse to accept her case. Eventually Tarun Anand (Abhishek Bachchan) agrees to represent her although he had initially rejected her. Tarun seeks assistance from Lal Sir who is his mentor and has experience in handling a HIV related case. Unfortunately Tarun and Tamanna lose the case and they refile the case in the high court (High Court of India).
Meanwhile Tamanna reaches out to Rohit who is battling for his life in a hospital and dies in front of her due of AIDS.
Tarun fights the case very strongly and finally wins the case in high court. Tamanna later starts her own business venture and after 2 years is recognised by the Business Today (business magazine) as one of India's young achievers. Tamanna dedicates her award to Rohit.
