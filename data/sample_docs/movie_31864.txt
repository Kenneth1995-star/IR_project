Mohan (Mohan Babu) a childhood friend of Anji comes to that village as a police inspector. The president of that village tries to occupy the Ashramam by hook or crook. He even sets ashram on fire, but Anji in an attempt to save children, loses his left eye. Swamiji requests Mohan to marry Anji's sister, but Laxmi is already in love with her classmate Prembabu. But, when prembabu behaves nastily, Anji beats him black and blue, and prembabu dies later. Now Inspector Mohan is forced to arrest Chiranjeevi. Meanwhile, Swamiji is prohibited from entering the village on the pretext of he being the thief of temple's ornaments. Village's president is behind this conspiracy. All of a sudden, Chakravathy, a world-famous disco dancer, comes to that village, who is none other than Anji in disguise, who proves of his innocence in Prembabu's murder case. President is found guilty for all the evil happenings and is arrested. Story ends with Mohan marrying Laxmi.
