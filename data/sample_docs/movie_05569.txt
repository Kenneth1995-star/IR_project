Babes in Bagdad

Arabian Nights princess Kyra goes on strike demanding equal rights for women, to the frustration of caliph Hassan. Supported by the caliph's godson, Ezar, Kyra enables the caliph to see the error of his polygamous ways, and he eventually settles down with his favourite wife, Zohara.
