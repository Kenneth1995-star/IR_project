Naanum Oru Penn

Bhaskar (S.S. Rajendran) and Balu (AVM Rajan) are brothers living with their father, the zamindar of Selvapuram (S.V. Rangarao), who prefers that his sons marry fair-skinned daughters. Things escalate when the illiterate, dark-skinned Kalyani (Vijayakumari) visits Rajendran who falls in love with her. Even as the zamindar begins to warm up to Kalyani, she becomes the victim of a nefarious plot concocted by the brothers' uncle and is cast out of the house.
