Vikingdom

In the midst of time comes the clanging of steel against steel, and in a collision of myth and history, there is the "Vikingdom". Based on Viking folklore and the poems they left, "Vikingdom" is a fantasy, action adventure film about a forgotten king named Eirick. Tasked with the impossible odds to defeat Thor, the Norse god of thunder, who is on a mission to gather key ancient relics: the Mj√∂lnir, his hammer from Valhalla; the Necklace of Mary Magdalene from Mitgard; and the Horn from Helheim. This needs to be accomplished before the sinister event of the Blood Eclipse, or else dire consequences will be faced by all in the realm.[4]
