In the city of Chennai traditional rivalry has always existed between the students of Pachaiyappas and Loyola colleges respectively. Karthik (Vineeth) is poor and an orphan, who studies in Pachaiyappa's College, lives in a rented room, travels by the bus, hangs out with a number of friends, and is the captain of his football team. He is also a good poet and daydreams about his dream girl. Arun (Abbas), on the other hand, comes from a rich and wealthy family, studies in Loyola College, drives his own car, hangs out with number of friends, and is also the captain of his football team. In a nasty intercollege riot Arun saves Karthik's life. So in return Karthik lets Arun win in a soccer game because he thinks Arun can't take losses easily. Arun realizes that the victory is because of Karthik's sacrifice.
They become good friends, and they both show a good example of friendship to the others in the college road. Things were going smooth until the new girl Divya (Tabu) joins the college. Both of the guys fall in love with her, but neither of them realize that they both are in love with the same girl. In a chain of events when they realize that both are loving the same girl,their friendship is strained and they fight with each other. The end of the movie shows whether Divya will fall in love with one of them and whether their friendship will be affected. At the end Divya says that she likes them both but do not want to choose one thereby losing the other and disrupting their friendship. Hence the film ends with Arun and Karthik reverting their friendship back.
