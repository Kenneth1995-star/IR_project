404

Professor Anirudh (Nishikant Kamath) strongly believes in science and for him things which don’t have scientific explanation do not exist. A room in his medical institution (numbered 404) is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of a student who previously stayed in that room and had committed suicide there, which he surely doesn’t believe. A rational student Abhimanyu (Rajvvir Aroraa) now occupies that room. Abhimanyu experiences the unusual and now has to choose between what to believe and what not. Despite evidence suggesting a rational explanation to the physical events following up to the climax, the movie closes open-endedly, leaving a supernatural explanation equally likely.[2]
