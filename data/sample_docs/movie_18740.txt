Green for Danger

In August 1944, during the V-1 doodlebug offensive on London, patient Joseph Higgins (Marriott) dies on the operating table in a rural British hospital somewhere in the southeast of England. The anaesthetist, Barney Barnes (Howard), has had a patient die in similar circumstances previously, and when Sister Bates (Campbell) is killed after revealing that the death of Higgins was not an accident, Inspector Cockrill (Sim) is asked to investigate. Cockrill's investigation is hampered by the conflict between Barnes and Mr. Eden (Genn) because of their competition for the affections of nurse Freddi (Gray). After a murder attempt is directed at Freddi, the inspector re-stages the operation in order to unmask the murderer.
