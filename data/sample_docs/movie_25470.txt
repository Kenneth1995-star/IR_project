Watan Ke Rakhwale

Radha Pratap (Sridevi) lives a wealthy lifestyle with her widowed businessman dad, Raja (Sudhir Dalvi); her maternal grandma (Lalita Pawar); and paternal uncle, Dr. Narendra (Prem Chopra), who runs a mental hospital. Shortly after her father dies in a car accident, her marriage is arranged with equally wealthy Naresh Puri (Dan Dhanoa), the only child of Raj (Kader Khan). When the marriage is about to be finalized, a man named Arun (Mithun Chakraborty) interrupts the ceremony, informing them that Radha is already married to him, and produces proof and a witness, Prof. Peter Fernandes (Ashok Kumar).
The wedding is canceled amidst chaos as Radha claims that she had never seen Arun, leave alone married him. A few days later, Narendra and Raj ask Radha to sign a divorce petition, which will annul the marriage so that she will be free to marry Naresh, which she does sign. When the time comes for her to move out, she refuses and admits that she made a mistake and admits having been married to Arun, who lives with his Jailor brother, Suraj Prakash (Sunil Dutt) and his wife, Laxmi (Moushumi Chatterjee). A few days later, Naresh is arrested by the Police for smuggling, and lodged in a jail, where he is killed by a convict named Mahavir (Dharmendra), who had seen Naresh sexually molest his sister, Vimla (Divya Rana). Enraged at the death of his son, Raj has his men molest and threaten Laxmi. Shortly thereafter Narendra's body is found, knifed to death.
Suraj confesses to this crime, is arrested, tried in court and sentenced to 6 years in the very jail where he used to be the Jailor. Raj arranges the abduction of Radha, Laxmi, and Arun and has them confined on an island that is not within the jurisdiction of any country. The questions remain; why did Arun claim that Radha is married to him, and why did Suraj confess to killing Narendra, and what is going to be the fate of Raj's victims?
