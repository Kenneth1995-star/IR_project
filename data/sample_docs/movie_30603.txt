Sarath Kumar, Namitha

Velu (R. Sarathkumar) is living happily with his sister and friend Pazhani (Vadivelu) in Palani. Velu stays away from all wanted troubles and is forced to resort to fighting to defend his sister from the local rowdy Raghavan (Vincent Asokan). A flashback follows where it is revealed that Velu is a military officer, and his sister is actually the sister of his best friend and Police Officer Murugan (Kalabhavan Mani) of Chennai. It is also revealed that Velu had maintained a low profile to protect his sister from his foe Nachiyaar (Kota Srinivasa Rao) whom he had left crippled before he went into hiding.
How Velu protects his sister and his love interest Anjali (Namitha) from Nachiyar and Vincent Asokan forms the rest of the story.
