Yagnam

Seenu (T. Gopichand) is a loyal servant and a right-hand of faction leader Reddeppa (Devaraj). He and Sailaja ,( Moon Banerjee) the daughter of Reddeppa, grew together. Nayudamma (Vijaya Rangaraju) is an arch rival of Reddeppa. Factional feuds between them have resulted in a loss of a number of lives among their groups. When Reddeppa realizes that his daughter and Seenu are in love, he swings into action by trying to kill Seenu. Rest of the story is all about how Seenu secures the hand of Sailaja and how he unites the forces of followers in both the warring groups to teach their masters (Reddeppa and Nayudamma) a lesson or two.
