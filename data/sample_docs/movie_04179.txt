Because of Him

Kim Walker (Deanna Durbin) is an ambitious waitress who dreams of being on the stage. She tricks respected stage actor John Sheridan (Charles Laughton) into signing a letter of introduction. Thanks to the forged letter, Kim then wins the role of Sheridan's co-star in his next play, much to the disgust of the writer Paul Taylor (Franchot Tone).
