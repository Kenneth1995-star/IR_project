Plastic City

Set in the traditional neighborhood of Liberdade in downtown SÃ£o Paulo, Plastic City has an immense Eastern community that was established over the years as protagonist, people who are seeking for a land of opportunity and a place for new business - legal or illegal. It is in the midst of Chinese cultural traditions and the chaos of urban life that the immigrant Yuda and his son Kirin are commanding a piracy mafia in Brazil, but this empire went into decline when they were threatened by a powerful organization with strong international influences.[2]
