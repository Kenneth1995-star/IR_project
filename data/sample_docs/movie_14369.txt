Testosterone

Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe) is a thirty-something graphic novelist living in L.A., and though he's found personal happiness with his hot, Argentinian boyfriend, Pablo (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), he can't surmount his writer's block slump following his successful debut graphic novel, Teenage Speed Freak. His life begins to unravel when his editor, Luise (Coolidge), gives him an ultimatum, and Pablo, the sexy boyfriend, goes out for cigarettes one night and never comes back. Lonely, depressed, and at the end of his rope, Seagrave flies to Argentina in search of closure, but the characters he discovers there – Pablo's secretive and controlling Mother (Sônia Braga), Pablo's ex-lover Marcos (Leonardo Brzezicki), and Marcos' enigmatic sister Sofia (Celina Font) – conspire to prevent him from reaching Pablo.
