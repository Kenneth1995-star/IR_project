Raisahib Parandhamaiah (Nagabhushanam) lives a wealthy lifestyle with his wife of Gajalaxmi (Suryakantham), they have two sons elder one Ananda Rao (Prabhakar Reddy), who has been married to Shantha (Pushpa Kumari) for several years; and younger one Ramakrishna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) who is studying in an out of town college. Parandhamaiah is disappointed with Ramakrishna's behavior of devout worshiper of Lord Hanuman and he has taken a vow of celibacy and refuses to get married. Things change dramatically when a young woman named Vasantha (Jayalalitha), Ramakrishna's classmate who love him a lot but he rejects due to the vow. So she makes a challenge that she will definitely marry him. Suddenly she enters into Raisahib's house along with a baby claiming that Ramakrishna had married and abandoned her. She goes through a number of medical tests which determine that the child is actually an heir of the Raisahib family. Now Parandhamaiah and Gajalaxmi want Ramakrishna and Vasantha to get officially married. Things get complicated when Parandhamaiah finds out that the child is actually Anand Rao's who cheated Vasantha's elder sister Janaki (Sukanya) and she has been died leaving baby's responsibility to her sister, and that Vasantha may have been pulling wool over all their eyes.
