The Show-Off

Amy Fisher's parents can't understand what their daughter sees in Aubrey Piper, a loudmouth and braggart who pretends to be more than the lowly clerk he is.
She marries Aubrey even though he can't seem to stop insulting others or interfering with their lives. He accidentally sets her inventor brother Joe's laboratory on fire and also wrecks a car, driving it without a license. He is kicked off a radio show for offending the sponsor and blows Joe's deal with a paint company by demanding the inventor be paid $100,000.
Things go from bad to worse as Amy and Aubrey move in with her parents. In the end, though, a change of heart from the paint company's boss seals Joe's deal and Aubrey gets the credit, pleasing everyone.
