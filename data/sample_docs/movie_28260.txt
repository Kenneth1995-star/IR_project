Athe Mazha Athe Veyil (അതേ മഴ അതേ വെയിൽ)

Athe Mazha Athe Veyil tells the story of a family and the problems faced by its members. Raghuraman (Anoop Menon) and Sreelakshmi (Lena) are government employees and due to their heavy work load, they can find little time to spare for their only son. Sreelakshmi finds her husband's attitude indifferent, and accordingly, she gets even more demanding. She insists that her husband should co-operate more in the household chores, and not just leave her alone to do all the work by herself. Raghuraman refuses to comply with Sreelakshmi's demands and this gradually leads to a rift between the two. In the clamor to establish their own territories, they forget about their only son.[1]
