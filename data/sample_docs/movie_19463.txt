The Night We Dropped a Clanger

When mysterious, unpiloted, midget aircraft start landing in southern England during the Second World War, top secret agent Wing Commander Blenkinsop, VC and bar, is chosen for a top-secret mission to occupied France to investigate. Meanwhile, as a diversionary tactic to deceive the Germans, his exact look-alike, Aircraftsman Atwood (both parts are played by Rix), is reluctantly recruited to go to North Africa. However, through a farcical mixup, Blenkinsop finds himself in Africa and Atwood ends up in France. By far more luck than judgement, Atwood returns to England with one of the buzz bombs, and, with everyone (including Blenkinsop's girlfriend) believing he is Blenkinsop, he continues the impersonation and becomes a national hero, while the real Blenkinsop desperately tries to regain his identity and his life.[3]
