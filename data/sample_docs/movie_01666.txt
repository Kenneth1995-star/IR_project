Come On Marines!

"Lucky" Davis, a ladies' man and a devil-may-care U.S. Marine sergeant, is leading a Marine squadron on an expedition through a Philippine jungle where an outlaw bandit is leading a guerrilla-war rebellion. Their assignment is to rescue a group of children from an island mission that has been cut off from all communication. When they arrive, they get a bit of a surprise when Davis discovers that the "children" are a group of 18- to 25-year-old girls blissfully bathing in a pool while awaiting rescue.
