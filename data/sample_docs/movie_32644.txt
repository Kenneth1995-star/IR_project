Jai Hind 2

Jaihind is the journey of five people, linked by one man, who fights for children's rights to education. Parvathi (Yuvina Parthavi), from a very poor family background, gets an admission into one of the most affluent schools in the city, but unable to pay the exorbitant fees, the man of the house sells one of his kidneys. They still fall short of a big chunk of money and they finally give up and commit suicide. This disturbs Abhimanyu (Arjun Sarja) deeply, and the computer service engineer becomes a hero over night, by propagandizing a solution for education costing so much. Abhimanyu suggests that all private schools be nationalised, which will compel them to offer services at very little fees compared to that being collected now, while still ensuring that the quality of education is not compromised. This is bad news for the private school owners, who make a business out of educating children. And hence Abhimanyu is targeted and pushed to extremes. He is put behind bars and is conspired to be murdered. How he succeeds in his mission, despite all this, forms the crux of the movie.
