Have Fun, Vasya!

Mitya (Efim Petrunin) accidentally proposes to Alisa (Svetlana Stepankovskaya), and the girl's father immediately sets the date for their wedding. The situation is complicated by the fact that Mitya still has not divorced from his ex â€“ Vasilisa (Lybov Aksyonova), and naturally he does not want to tell his bride and her father about this. Vasya is ready to agree to a divorce only after her still lawful husband fulfills a number of conditions; one of them is that he must present her to his bride.
Mitya finds a girl, Nastya (Sofia Raizman), who agrees to appear before Vasya as the bride. Nastya's boyfriend Max (Roman Kurtsin), after learning about this gets furious at first, but then agrees to also take part in this affair in return for a considerable fee from Mitya. Then the events unfold in such a way that Mitya and Nastya fall in love with each other.
