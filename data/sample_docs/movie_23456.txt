Victim

Ma (Lau Ching-wan) is kidnapped in a parking structure. His girlfriend Amy Fu (Amy Kwok) informs the police that though he had been jobless for a while and had a lot of debt, he was not a bad man. Police detective Pit (Tony Leung Ka-fai) later discovers Ma beaten, bloodied, and dangling upside down from the ceiling of an old abandoned hotel. The hotel in question is said to be haunted from murder-suicide of the original owner and his wife. On returning home, Ma starts terrifying Amy by behaving like the famous ghost of the hotel. The police begin to suspect that Ma's possession might be a ruse to hide something other crimes that are happening.
