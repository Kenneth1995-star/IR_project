Gene-X

A young research doctor named Tom Gray is on the verge of a genetic cure for cancer. Nurse Casey Gordon (played by Ayse Tezel) is desperate to save the life of a child in her care and seduces Tom into testing his therapy. Early success brings romance into Tom's life for the first time, but Casey has a secret lover whose jealous anger puts their lives in danger, and Tom finds his out his cure has a dark side.[2]
