All the Wrong Reasons

The film is set in the Fairfax Department store, a big-box outlet in which Kate Ascher (Vanasse) works as a security guard while her husband James (Monteith) is the store's manager. Kate is unable to touch other people - including her husband - or even have them near her due to the traumatic stress of seeing her sister commit suicide. After James tries unsuccessfully to bring Kate out of her isolation, he pursues intimacy from one of the store's cashiers, Nicole (Hampshire).
Simon Brunson (Zegers) joins the store staff. He faces his own stresses after being injured in his former job as a firefighter. His efforts to deal with his situation inspires Kate to lash out against her cheating husband, ruin his career and cost Nicole custody of her son, which allows Kate to begin her recovery of a normal life with Simon.
