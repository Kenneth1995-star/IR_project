The Big Pond

Pierre Mirande (Maurice Chevalier) is a Venetian tour guide from a poor French family who falls in love with Barbara Billings (Claudette Colbert), a wealthy American tourist. Barbara loves Pierre in return, but her suitor Ronnie (Frank Lyon) and her father (George Barbier) see him as a fortune hunter.
Barbara's mother (Marion Ballou) persuades her husband to give Pierre a job in his chewing-gum factory in the States. Despite living in a dingy boardinghouse and being given the hardest job in the plant, he manages to captivate his landlady (Andr√©e Corday) and the maid (Elaine Koch) with his humorous songs.
Unfortunately, he falls asleep on the night he is to attend Barbara's party, and then he is fired when he's wrongly accused of spilling rum on some chewing gum samples. He wins back his job and is promoted when he sells liquor-coated chewing gum as a sales gimmick. Barbara disapproves and plans to marry Ronnie, but Pierre whisks her away in a speedboat.[3][4]
