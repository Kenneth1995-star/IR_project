Sautela

Raghuvir, the head of the village Panchayat, and Arjun are step-brothers who live separately. Arjun always respects his elder brother Raghuvir. Raguvir's wife and daughter also love Arjun, but Raghuvir openly dislikes him being the step-brother. One day local goons tried to rape Raghuvir's daughter and Arjun beats them. Without knowing the fact, Raghuvir punished Arjun. The Enemy of their family and local Don uses this hatred to their advantage.[2]
