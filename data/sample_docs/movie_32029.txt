Osey Ramulamma

Ramulamma (Vijayashanti), is born in a Dalit caste. At a very young age of 13, she was impregnated by the dora (Rami Reddy). The dora orders his men to throw the baby and kill Ramulamma. The baby was found by naxals and was raised by them. Injured Ramulamma was taken care by a Dalit couple who treat her as their own sister. They live in a typical feudal Telangana village where Doralu (feudal lords) exploit peasants in the name of bonded labour and debts. Ramulamma was asked to work at Dora ghadi (palace) to be a maid of Dorasani (wife of Dora).
One day Dora son tries to forcefully sleep with Ramulamma. She refuses but, she cannot do anything except to kill the Dora son in his bed. Knowing that, Dora wants to kill Ramulamma but she was rescued by Naxal leader Komranna (Dasari Narayana Rao) and taken to forest where Komaranna and other naxalites live. She learns the ideology and believes in it and gradually becomes a leader after Komaranna. Meanwhile, Ramulamma's son was also killed by Dora. CBI officer (Krishna) who was sent by Central Government to look into the Naxalite issue, convinces Ramulamma and Komaranna to surrender. But later he finds that Government is corrupt and Dora's I are ruling the government. He gets to know that Ramulamma is going to be killed by Dora's illegally. He helps Ramulamma in escaping from the jail but Komaranna and CBI officer dies in the firing with police. Ramullama finally kills Dora.
