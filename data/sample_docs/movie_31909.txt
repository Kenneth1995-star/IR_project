State Rowdy

Kalicharan (Chiranjeevi) is a rowdy who kidnaps all the leading rowdies from various parts of the state working under two rivals (Rao Gopal Rao and Nutan Prasad), and makes them do various good jobs. Asha (Bhanupriya) has interest in him and keeps helping him in his deeds. To get rid of this "state rowdy," the villains come to know that he has a mother and cousin Radha (Radha) and informs them on his whereabouts.
It is known that Kaali is actually Prithvi, and was an aspiring candidate for becoming a police officer, but does not get job due to Laajmani (Sharada), though he performs well in the interview and all the tests. He becomes anti-law due to this and turns as state rowdy to get rid of all the rowdies himself by taking law into his own hands. When his mother and Radha see him, he is forced to reveal the secret that he is actually a police informer working for Laajmani to bring criminals to justice. Laajmani has lost her husband and daughter in fighting the villains.
Later, it is learnt that Asha is Laajmani’s daughter, and she gets accused of murdering Rao Gopal Rao’s younger brother (Thiagarajan). The rest of the story forms on how she is acquitted with help of Kaali, and how Kaali and Laajmani get rid of their enemies by bringing them to justice.
