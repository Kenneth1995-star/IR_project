Dekh Kabira Roya

This Bollywood classic is a farcical comedy about the vicissitudes of modern love. Mohan (Anoop Kumar), Pradeep (Daljit), and Ranjeet (Jawahar Kaul) are three struggling artists—singer, painter, and writer, respectively—who live together in the same rooming house. Romantic hijinks ensue when the trio meet three lovely girls, Geeta (Ameeta), Rekha (Anita Guha), and Kalpana (Shubha Khote), with very specific ideas about art and love.[1] The three male friends decide to help each other out by using their talents, and utter and hilarious chaos reigns.[2]
