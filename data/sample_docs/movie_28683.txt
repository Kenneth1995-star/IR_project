Dr. Aditya (Sandeep Kulkarni), a leading homeopathy practitioner with his own hospital, is challenged by a phone call in the midst of a live TV interview series. The caller – Sarjerao (Kishor Kadam) – accuses him of using fraudulent means of treatment, and the TV host, on the suggestion of his producer (Yogesh Dattatraya Gosavi), asks Aditya to react on the media reports quoting homeopathy as "fake science".
The police begin investigating the case on a complaint received from Sarjerao. Ms. Renu (Neelam Shirke), posing as a journalist, also carries out an investigation. Finally, Renu reveals the truth during the second part of the live TV show. [4]
