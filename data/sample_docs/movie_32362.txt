Rajeev is an atheist, but his wife and mother have immense belief in god and black magic (Chethabadalu). On a regular day of his work at the construction site, Shyam (Narsing Yadav), his assistant reports the finding of an ancient Ganesh idol. He also advises Rajeev to construct a temple to Ganesh and says if not built it will be a bad omen for them. However, Rajeev takes heads deaf to his words. One day Rajeev comes to know that Venu & Madhu are big cheaters, who have made big proud in his company, through his friend Vinay (Subbaraju). Rajeev insults them before everyone and kicks them out of his company.
After this incident, suddenly on an uneventful day strange things happens in his house and Raksha starts behaving unusually. His mother and wife plead to him to overlook the unforeseen circumstances, but he will not listen to them. When the health level of Raksha starts deteriorating, he takes her to a psychiatrist Dr. Rangarajan (Jeeva). The doctor was tongue tied and unable to explain the changes that are happening to Raksha. With all the doors closed, a specialist in psychology, Dr. Seema (Jayasudha) makes her entry. Finally, Rajeev starts believing in miracles and black magic. Vinay takes him to a black magician Baba (Pradeep Rawat), and finds out that it was black magic done by Venu & Madhu and Mani (Sekhar) Rajeev’s car driver is helping them. The remaining story is how Rajeev saves Raksha from the menace.
