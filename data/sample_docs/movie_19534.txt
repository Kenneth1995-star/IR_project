Sons and Lovers

A young man with artistic talent who lives in a close-knit, English coal-mining town during the early 20th century finds himself inhibited by his emotionally manipulative, domineering mother — a literary, psychological interpretation of the Oedipus story. Gertrude Morel, miserable in her marriage, puts her hope into her son, Paul. In her attempt to manipulate Paul's life she jealously attempts to prevent Paul from having a relationship with any woman. However, Paul goes to the city for a job and becomes enchanted with self-actualized and "liberated" feminist co-worker, Mrs. Clara Dawes, who is married. Paul and Clara become involved sexually and Clara realizes that Paul's emotional attachment, as with her own, lies with another person — in Paul's case, his mother. Gertrude learns of Paul's involvement with Clara, and she slips into a morose depression and physical sickness. Paul flees to his mother, to care for her and sit by her side. After his mother's death, Paul meets the girlfriend of his youth, Miriam, and tells her that because of his codependency with his mother he intends to live the rest of his life without any serious relationship with another woman — in essence fulfilling his mother's desire and objective.
