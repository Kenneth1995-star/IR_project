Govula Gopanna

Radha (Bharathi) is the daughter of Pleader Narasimham (Relangi). Since Radha is of marriageable age, he has arranged to get her married to Advocate Shekar (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and shows his photograph to her, and she shyly approves. The young man shows up, and to the family's delight, not only is he well versed in Law but also in dairy farming. Both Shekar and Radha fall in love with each other and want to get married. They already have the blessings of Narasimham. Then one day while at a picnic, Shekhar excuses himself from Radha's company as he wants to meet a friend. Radha secretly follows him and is shocked to see him in the arms of another woman, Taara (Rajasree), who is the only daughter of wealthy Chairman Nagaraju (Gummadi). Then Radha confronts Shekhar with her knowledge and asks him why he has been two-timing her? and came to know that there is another person with the similar looks named Gopi (again Akkineni Nageswara Rao).
