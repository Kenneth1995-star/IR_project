Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love

In this movie, Dudley "Booger" Dawson (Curtis Armstrong) is getting married to his Omega Mu girlfriend Jeannie (Corinne Bohrer), but the father of the bride tries to stop them, as his desire to maintain his conservative, nouveau-riche standing clashes with his daughter's common interests with and love for the nerdy Booger. Jeannie's father works with his loathsome son-in-law Chip (the husband of Jeannie's older sister Gaylord) to find a way to discredit Booger and cause Jeannie to call off the wedding. Lewis Skolnick and the other nerds discover the conspiracy and work to save Booger's wedding ceremony from being torpedoed. In a subplot, Lewis' wife Betty is pregnant with their first child, and is in her third trimester as the wedding date approaches.
Booger fights an accusation that he fathered an illegitimate child. In the end, Jeannie's mom tells her husband that she will leave him if he does not support his daughter's wedding to Booger, and Chip's accusations fall apart when the little girl reveals she was "drafted" from an orphanage to play the illegitimate child role. Chip's wife decides to divorce him and throw him out of their lives forever, leaving Chip to swear his own revenge against the nerds (while Gaylord declares to cheers that her next husband will be a nerd). In the end, Booger and Jeannie are married, Betty gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and the newly married couple tell Heidi, the little orphan girl, they would like to adopt her.
