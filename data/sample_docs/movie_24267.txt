Geeta

Shankar (Chandra Mohan) lives an unhappy existence with his pious wife Durga (Durga Khote), and son Mohan. Durga is a staunch believer of and clings rigidly to the teachings of Bhagavad Geeta. Shankar is irritated with his wife's devotional attendance on holy scripture, especially as the family is poor and things are not working out for him. One day, he takes his young son Mohan and leaves Durga behind. An expectant Durga, does not give up her beliefs and brings up the second child with good attributes and education. Shnkar now starts following a life of crime, in which Mohan joins him. Several years pass with Shankar and Mohan, now grown (Chandra Mohan again) continuing with their looting and killing. Shankar is caught in one of the killing sprees with the plotting of an opposite gang member and hanged. Mohan vows to take revenge on the gang for his father's death. He is soon caught and brought to court where his own younger brother Kumar (Trilok Kapoor) is the prosecutor. The mother meets her older son, and Mohan is finally repentant and looking for atonement.
