Naked Ambition 2

Literature graduate Wyman Chan (Chapman To) writes erotic stories in the soft porn section of the newspaper for a living, but with the soft porn section ceasing publication, he loses his job. The unemployed Chan becomes capricious, and takes inspiration from men working in the Japanese adult video (AV) industry to become a producer of pornographic films. Chan's idea immediately receives enthusiastic responses from his friends, who offer their help—especially Hatoyama (Josie Ho), who is familiar with the Japanese porn industry. While everyone initially takes great interest in being a part of filming, Chan is soon forced into acting in the lead role. Surprisingly, Chan becomes a sensation in Japan for his performance of being sexually harassed and dominated by women in the AV. Hatoyama immediately travels to Hong Kong to persuade Chan to pursue his unrealistic dream—a Hong Kong man entering the Japanese AV industry.
