To the Fore

The story is about Jiu Ming (Eddie Peng) and Qiu Tian (Shawn Dou) who recently joined a Taiwan Category III cycling team called Radiant. They competed in domestic and international continental road races. After some time, the team had to break up because the team didn't have sufficient money to continue operations. The members dispersed to different teams. To The Fore is a half romance, half sport movie. It is mainly about the passion of the cyclists participating in races, and the beauty of the road racing locations in Taiwanâ€™s lush, mountainous landscapes.[2]
