Daughter Of Sindbad

As Sinbad the Sailor was returning home with a shipload of treasures, he vanished and was presumed to be lost in the wilderness. His daughter Shabnam (Nadira) set out to search for him, and when she reached the "Island of Halem Alah", she ran befoul of the island's King who was himself under control of his own Vizier. She and the king's heir fall in love as it develops that Sinbad was a captive of the Vizier. The Vizier had been torturing Sinbad to learn the secrets of his treasure.
