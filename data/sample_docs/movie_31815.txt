Meghasandesham

Ravindrababu (ANR) is a great poet, lover of nature and arts, and has a peculiar poetic and sensitive mindset. He gets married to a rustic and a simple woman Parvathi (Jayasudha). Her brother Jagannatham (Jaggaiah) is extremely fond of his sister. Though Ravindrababu loves Parvathi as a wife, he fails to get inspiration from her as a poet. The couple lack good wavelength match. It is when he meets an artist personified woman Padma (Jayaprada). Her dance skills, expressions, looks and the poetic touch makes Ravindrababu express himself as a poet. Right from then he transforms to an admirer of Padma. Parvathi feels bad for this thinking Padma- a woman belonging to prostitute family has snatched her husband. Jagannatham enters the scene and warns Padma not to disturb Ravindrababuâ€™s family. As a result, Ravindrababu gets deeply hurt. He becomes isolated with the fond memories of Padma and explains his grief in a poetic way to nature and clouds (Hence the name Megha Sandesam). The film ends with his demise after meeting his wife.
