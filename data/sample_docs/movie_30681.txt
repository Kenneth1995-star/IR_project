Newly married couple Akhilan (Arya) and Anbarasi (Renuka Menon) shift to their new house in Chennai. They live a happy life, even though their marriage was not love based at first. Soon, Anbarasi's family came to visit them and left Anbarasi's sister Kanmani (Akshaya) as she wants to pursue her studies in multimedia. As Kanmani stays with her sister and brother-in-law in the same house, she begins to develop feelings for Akhilan. She adores him even though it's her own sister's husband. Kanmani continues to romance with Akhilan whenever her sister is not around.
Akhilan doesn't want to hurt his beloved wife who has now given birth. Akhilan seeks advice from a doctor on how to solve his problem. The doctor tells him to try and marry Kanmani off to her male cousin. Following Akhilan's advice, the male cousin goes after Kanmani, threatening her to love him and marry him. She rejects him, and this makes him furious. One day, he kidnaps Kanmani who was on the way from temple, raped her, and left her at Akhilan's apartment. This shocks everyone in the family, especially Akhilan, as he was the one brought him here. He admits to Kanmani about his action, and also told that the raping plan was not Akhilan's advice. He himself didn't except this. The whole family forces her to marry the cousin, in order to 'save face'.
The next morning, Kanmani committed suicide and died. Akhilan and Anbarasi, with their infant, go back to her village. Anbarasi's aunt hits Kanmani's husband as she thinks it was because of him Kanmani died. Akhilan, standing right beside him, was all over guilty because it was him who planned all this to avoid Kanmani disturbing his married life.
