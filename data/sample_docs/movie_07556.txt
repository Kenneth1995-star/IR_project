Twenty Plus Two

Janssen portrays Tom Alder, an investigator looking into the murder of a movie star's fan club secretary, and its possible connection to a missing heiress who had disappeared many years earlier. Crain plays Linda Foster, an old love of Alder's who re-enters his life, competing with her friend Nicki Kovac (Merrill) as she tries to win him back. Agnes Moorehead and William Demarest appear in support roles, each for only one scene with Janssen.
