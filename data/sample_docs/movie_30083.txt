Mani Rathnam

Rathnam (Napoleon) is a potter in his village and he is a short-tempered person. He has a sister Kavitha (Mohana) studying in city. Rathnam finally gets married with his relative Thangamani (Chandini) who is in love with Rathnam since her childhood.
Sivalingam (Jafar Azad) is a wealthy and wicked man in his village, his son Nadarajan (Babloo Prithiveeraj) is mentally ill. Sivalingam wants absolutely to build a factory in the village. Sivalingam already bought all the lands he needed in his village, he needs only one land : Rathnam's land which is near the temple. Rathnam refuses : he does not want to see the village temple being demolished by Sivalingam. When Sivalingam sends his henchmen to demolish the temple, Rathnam intervenes and beats them all. In the meantime, Kavitha and Mani (Anand Babu) fall in love with each other in city. Actually, Nadarajan is in love with Kavitha since school days and Sivalingam asks Thangamani to marry his mentally ill son to Kavitha but Thangamani rejects and insults him.
Later, Rathnam picked his sister up at the railway station, at their return to home, they see Thangamani hanged. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
