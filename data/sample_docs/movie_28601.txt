Allimoola is known for crazy Volleyball fans and they have a rich past history of players which now is only in the past. In each year's volleyball tournament the villagers place private bets on which team wins. Kavalam Jimmy (Asif Ali) and Vattathil Bosco (Narain) are always at loggerheads due to an incident in their school period. In an upcoming annual game both of them stake their sisters for each other to take by marriage. The whole village joins in for the bet and forms Volleyball teams. Bosco uses Minnal Simon (Biju Menon), a pathological debtor with some early insignificant experience in the field to coach Jimmy's team to fail. Bosco for his team appoints a police officer with whom Jimmy had an altercation and are in bad terms. In the finals Bosco pays off Jimmy's university players and Simon decides to show his integrity. Circumstances force Jimmy and his friends to be a substitute for their team and with some tricks from Simon's playbook they win the game. Jimmy's sister signals Bosco that she likes him and he is happy. Simon takes off with Jimmy's lady sponsor and Jimmy gets Bosco's sister with whom he had forged a love of sorts.[6]
