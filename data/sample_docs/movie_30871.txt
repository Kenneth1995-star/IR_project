Kadhalil Vizhunthen

The story focuses on the life of Sabhapathy (Nakul). He is the football-crazy son of an alcoholic and lives in the slums. However, he lives a comfortable life and plays football with his mates as he completes his college career. He meets Meera (Sunaina) after an accident and later develops a liking for her. He slowly starts to love her, but is afraid to express his love since she is rich and would react hastily. However, he later does confirm his love to her and she accepts. When Sabha leaves for a football match with his college, he promises that he will propose to her as soon as he gets back. Sabha returns from his match to only find out that Meera has died. Sabha is shocked and he slips into a psychotic depression, travelling around with Meera's dead body, still believing she is alive. To make matters even worse, the police are also after him. The film ends as he commits suicide after killing Meera's uncle Kasirajan (Hariraj), who murdered her in the first place in order to gain her wealth.
