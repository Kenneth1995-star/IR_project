A Choice of Two

The film stars Moore as a corporate chairman who is preparing to retire, and is choosing his successor; the candidates are a charming rogue (Nielsen) who is having an affair with the chairman's daughter (Bastedo), and a humorless schemer (Gary Reineke). However, in the process a major corporate fraud is uncovered, necessitating an investigation by Revenue Canada to identify the fraudster.[2]
