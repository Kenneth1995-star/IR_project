The film attempts to touch the nostalgia of childhood. The story of the film revolves around an urban couple Bimal and Meera and a broken window of Bimal's school's classroom. Bimal plans to visit his school where he spent many years of his childhood. When he visits the school, he finds the building in a very ill condition. He specially notices one broken window of a classroom corner where he used to sit daily and look outside through the window. Though Bimal has little money, he wants to donate something to school authority to repair that window. Since Bimal does not have sufficient money, he uses the money from his fianc√©e Meera's savings without informing her. When Bimal presents the window to the school authority, they reject it. Conditions get worse when Meera learns about it and she breaks relation with Bimal.[1][4]
