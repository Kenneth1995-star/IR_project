The Rocks of Valpre

While staying in a small French coastal town, a young English woman falls in love with a French cavalry officer. Their romance is dramatically cut short when she is sent back to England to finish her education in a convent, while he is wrongly accused of being a spy by a rival officer and sentenced to imprisonment on Devil's Island. She settles down to a comfortable and respectable marriage with a wealthy Englishman. Ten years later, however, she is threatened with blackmail, and her former lover escapes from Devil's Island to come to her aid. Seriously ill from his time on the penal colony, he dies shortly afterwards.
