The Mini-Skirt Mob

Jilted by boyfriend Jeff Logan, Shayne (the leader of an all-female motorcycle gang) decides to torment Jeff and his new bride, Connie.
The harassment backfires when Shayne's sister Edie is accidentally killed by a Molotov cocktail and when Shayne herself ends up hanging by her fingernails off a cliff.
