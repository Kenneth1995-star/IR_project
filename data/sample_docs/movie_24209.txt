Daku Mansoor

Mansoor (K. L. Saigal) is a dacoit who falls in love with Husn Pari (Husn Banu), the sister of the evil caliph. His escapades bring him notoriety and Mansoor moves to a new place where he stays as a guest at the merchant Ali's house. Ali and his family have no knowledge of Mansoor's past. Ali's daughter, Meher (Uma Sashi), starts loving Mansoor but he rebuffs her as he is still in love with Husn Pari. On learning that Husn Pari is to be married off by her brother, Mansoor becomes enraged. There follows a fight where Mansoor is badly beaten and in which Husn Pari gets stabbed by the dagger meant to kill Mansoor. Deeply affected, Mansoor gives up his dacoity and gets together with Meher.
