Insaaf

A gangster named Shah, owing allegiance to the Janardhan gang, is killed by Chimanbhai (Paresh Rawal) from a rival gang. Although he is in prison, Janardhan ensures that Chimanbhai is notified of his anger and vengeance. Chimanbhai arranges a meeting with Janardhan in the farm-house of Jagat Narayan, Minister and MP and kills him . Some schoolchildren and their teacher, Aarti Singh, who are at a picnic nearby witness this, but Chimanbhai and his men hunt them down and kill them all. The entire region is shocked at this killing and the police is under pressure to apprehend the killers at any cost. Anjali, the daughter of the caretaker of the picnic place, is injured critically while witnessing the killers during the killing. She dies when the Police Commissioner locates her.
Aarti's brother, police inspector Vikram Singh (Akshay Kumar), assists in finding out who the killers are and with the connivance of the Police Commissioner, gets his girlfriend, Divya (Shilpa Shetty), to pose as the injured Anjali to lure the killers into the open. This brings results – albeit not the ones Vikram and Divya had hoped. They are now on the run – from Chimanbhai's gangsters and from corrupt policemen, Jagat Narayan, the Member of Parliament (who is involved and will do anything within his power to ensure that both get killed). Divya plans to get kidnapped, but Vikram gets kidnapped instead. When he tries to escape, Chimanbhai attacks him unsuccessfully. Police Commissioner plays a very important role in the combing operation and helps Vikram to nab the culprits.
