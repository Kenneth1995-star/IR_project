House of Wolves

Charlie (Francis Ng) is a swindler who pretends to be an ALS patient, while Fung Yan-ping (Ronald Cheng) is an idle village leader. These two self-proclaimed wicked men fall in love at first sight with Yu Chun (Jiang Shuying), a newcomer to the village. Chun arrives to the village after falling out with her ex-boyfriend and pregnant with their child. While helpless, Chun devises a scheme where she invites Charlie and Yan-ping to her house for dinner, causing them to be drunk and mistakenly believing that one of them have impregnated her. Unable to find out who the real father of the child, Charlie and Yan-ping both take care of Chun. One day, Charlie and Yan-ping realized that neither one of them are the father of Chun's father, and furiously returns her to her ex-boyfriend in exchange for a cash. Afterwards, by chance, Charlie and Yan-ping discovers that Chun's ex-boyfriend plan to use their child for an experiment and decides to rescue Chun and her unborn child.
