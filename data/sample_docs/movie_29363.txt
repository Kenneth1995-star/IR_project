Thanipiravi

A criminal organization rages in the city of Chingleput.
It is also there, that Muthaiya (M. G. Ramachandran) lives very nice and modest.
With his father, Rathnapuram (S. A. Ashokan), they hold a small domestic forge.
Her younger sister Sivagami (Revathi) and her mother Meenatchi (P. K. Saraswathi) are the beings which he loves most to the world.
One day while Muthu (MGR) makes a delivery, he saves the beautiful Radha (Jayalalitha), girl of the officer of police, honorable Soundharam (M. N. Nambiar), who is exactly in charge of neutralizing the gang of Chingleput.
Until now, the policeman meets only failures.
Indeed, the suspects manage to escape by absorbing a mortal substance, so avoiding any interrogation !
But with Muthu, this group of criminals is going to have much to do, because the young man is tough.
Muthu is going to track them while going of surprises to surprised, sometimes unbearable.
The truth will be cruel for Muthu !
