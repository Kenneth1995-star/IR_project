The Little Ones

Two poor boys from London, Ted, an abused child and Jackie, the son of a prostitute run away to Liverpool in an attempt to stowaway on a ship bound to Jamaica. Arriving in Liverpool tired and hungry, they steal a suitcase which they hope to pawn for money to provide food. The owner of the suitcase, a wealthy shipping businessman, alerts the police and the boys are subsequently caught, scolded and sent home. Recognizing their dire life at home, a friendly superintendent tells that the boys that many ships leave here for Jamaica.
