Vetrivel

The film starts with a misunderstanding and ego clash between Rajamanickam (Prabhu) and his stepsister (Viji Chandrasekhar). Viji loses her husband and vows revenge on her brother.
Years go by, and we are introduced to another family in the neighbouring village: Vetrivel (Sasikumar), his brother Saravanan (Ananth Nag) and their parents (Renuka and Ilavarasu).
Saravanan, a college student, is in love with Subha (Varsha), who turns out to be the only daughter of Rajamanickam.
The two belong to different castes and Rajamanickam has other plans for his daughter. Things turn ugly when Vetrivel and his enterprising friends kidnap the wrong girl in their attempt to help Saravanan.
In an instant Vetrivelâ€™s world turns upside down.
How he manages to save the situation spiraling out of control by sacrificing his love with a Malayali research scholar Janani (Miya) and given his life married to a girl named Latha (Nikhila Vimal) forms the rest of the story.
