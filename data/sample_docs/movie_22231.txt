La Derniere fugue

During a family Christmas dinner, the Lévesque family meets in order to spend quality time together. However, a major topic of conversation spoils the festive atmosphere: the health of the father of this family (Jacques Godin), who is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In addition, the quality of life is more than anything but fair at that time, as the family often quarrels. His eldest son André (Yves Jacques) and André's son Sam (Aliocha Schneider) want to end his suffering by making him live his last moments in happiness. However, the rest of the family does not agree to this, believing that their father should live as long as possible. One thing is certain, is that this father and his wife (Andrée Lachapelle) will not separate under any circumstances.
