Gulumal-The Escape (ഗുലുമാൽ)

The film centers on Jerry (Jayasurya), a con man known for his high-stakes scams. His criminal actions create a rift in his family when he attempts to steal the family business from his sister. While planning a heist on a petrol station, Jerry helps an escaped convict, Ravi Varma (Kunchako Boban). Ravi had been caught performing similar heists with a similar con man.
Ravi Varma convinces Jerry to plan a formidable heist. An old acquaintance, Bose, tells Jerry of a forged painting that can be used to con a non-resident Indian (NRI) (Devan) out of ₹50 lakhs. The information creates a rift in the newly formed friendship as both Ravi Varma and Jerry attempt to outdo each other in order to take the money.
Coincidentally, Jerry's sister is an employee at the hotel where the NRI is staying, and both Ravi Varma and the NRI fall in love with her.
Ravi Varma and Jerry eventually lose the painting and decide to buy the original by pooling their money. They then sell it to the NRI for ₹3 crore. However, Jerry's father finds out about the plot and tells Jerry's sister, which further drives the siblings apart.
When Jerry and Ravi Varma realize that the check given to them is invalid, they fight and decide to part ways. Jerry runs into the master con man, Bose, who offers to help him resolve the situation, and takes Jerry to the wedding of Ravi Varma and Jerry's sister. Jerry learns that the entire sequence of events, starting from the gas station incident, had been completely staged as a form of gentle revenge in return for the scam that had sent Ravi Varma's father to jail.
Jerry asks for forgiveness from everyone and leaves the wedding. As the credits roll, Jerry is seen pondering another scam.
