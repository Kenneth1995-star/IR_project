Boston Blackie Goes Hollywood

Boston Blackie (Chester Morris) and his sidekick The Runt (George E. Stone) are called, first to a Manhattan apartment where there's $60,000 waiting in a safe, then to Hollywood, by Boston's old friend Arthur Manleder (Lloyd Corrigan) to bail him out of gangster trouble. Naturally the police are suspicious and trail him every step of the way.
