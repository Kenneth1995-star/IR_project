House of Horrors

Struggling sculptor, Marcel De Lange (Martin Kosleck) is depressed about the events going on in his life, and decides to commit suicide. But just as he's about to kill himself, he spots and saves a madman, named "The Creeper" (Rondo Hatton) from drowning. Shortly afterward, he takes the disfigured man into his care. Marcel also makes the Creeper the subject of his next sculpture and calls it his best creation. But as the reviews begin to break Marcel's last nerve, he has the Creeper start killing the critics. Marcel becomes obsessed with a beautiful female reporter, Joan, who is alone in thinking the deaths are related. When Marcel invites her over, she notices Marcel's sculpture of "The Creeper" and decides that Marcel must know the killer. Later, Marcel decides that she knows too much, but the Creeper is reluctant to kill her when he discovers Marcel's plan to turn the Creeper over to the police.
