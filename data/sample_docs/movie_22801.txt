The ill-fated lovers are Lu Tu (Ethan Juan), the bell captain at a grand hotel, and Juan (Du Juan), whose beauty regularly opens doors — most often to the bedrooms of wealthy older men. When a Shanghai-born Chinese American nicknamed Mr. Money arrives to recruit workers for a new hotel in Manhattan, Juan is ready to go. But Lu Tu, who hates his father for abandoning the family, doesn’t want to be the kind of guy who runs away. He must choose between home and love, ultimately making a catastrophic decision.
