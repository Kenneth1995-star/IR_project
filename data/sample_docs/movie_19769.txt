Curse of Simba

When white hunter Mike Stacey kills a lion in Simbazi country in Africa, he is cursed by the tribal chief. When the curse that manifests itself with hallucinations follows him to England, he consults an expert on the subject. The expert informs Stacey that the only way to remove the curse is to return to Africa and personally kill the man who put it on him.
