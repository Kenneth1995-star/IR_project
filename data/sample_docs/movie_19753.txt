We Shall See

Alva (Faith Brook), the mentally unbalanced wife of airline pilot Evan Collins (Maurice Kaufmann), wants her husband to leave his job. However, she is tragically killed when someone throws a hive of bees into her bedroom. Police deduce that whoever was responsible knew that Alva was allergic to the insects, and suspicion immediately falls on her husband.
