Besharam

After Digvijay Singh (Amjad Khan) implicates him as a corrupt person, Ramchandra (A. K. Hangal), a teacher, commits suicide. After this incident, his obedient and simple son Ram Kumar (Amitabh Bachchan), an insurance agent, faces many difficulties. Resolved to fight against the injustice in society and uncover the criminal elements, he joins forces with the Police Commissioner (Iftekar) and transforms himself into Prince Chandrashekar, a top diamond businessman from South Africa.
A few years later, Digvijay Singh becomes a powerful person in the city with a dubious personality. He seems to be a decent industrialist, Dharamdas, while smuggling drugs, running many criminal activities and keeping poisonous snakes to kill his enemies and traitors.
Ram Kumar loves Rinku (Sharmila Tagore), unaware that she is Dharamdas's sister. Disguised as Prince Chandrashekar, Ram wins the heart of Dharmdas's beloved Manju (Bindu), who gets close to him and enters his business. Finally, he succeeds in arresting him.
