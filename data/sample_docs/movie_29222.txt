Mannadhi Mannan

Dancer Chitra (Padmini) and prince of Uraiyur Manivannan (M.G. Ramachandran) fall in love with each other after meeting in a dance competition. However, Chola King Kanikannan also desires Chitra. Meanwhile, Manivannan’s father, the Cheran King sends his minister, seeking the hand of Karpagavalli, daughter of King Karigala, for his son.
But the King thwarts this proposal, talking ill of the heredity of Manivannan’s mother. Unable to bear his mother being insulted, Manivannan goes to the Chola kingdom and abducts Karpagavalli. In the meantime, a dacoit, played very cleverly by Kanikannan, forces Manivannan to marry Karpagavalli.
