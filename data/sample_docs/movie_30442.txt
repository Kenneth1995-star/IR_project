Kaatrukkenna Veli

Manimekalai (Sujitha) is a young woman and a LTTE rebel fighter. During a battle in Valvettithurai (northeast coast of Sri Lanka), she was seriously injured in the leg. A small group of rebels take her on a boat and are headed to India. They land in Point Calimere (India). With the help of an Indian Tamil intermediate, they reach a hospital in Nagapattinam.
Dr. Subhash Chandra Bose (Sriman) aka Subhash is a doctor, he first refuses to treat Manimekalai because it is an illegal matter. After seeing her leg's condition, he finally accepts to operate her but Manimekalai does not want to be amputed. It was a sensitive case, the doctors successfully operate her leg but it's only temporary. Her leg could be at anytime collapsed and she could died of it. Subhash doesn't understand why she risks her life for her leg and she tells him her past.
In the past, Manimekalai was a cheerful and careless girl. After failing a class twice, she left school. One day, the disabled woman Lakshmi (Kushboo) had just moved in next door. Lakshmi and Manimekalai became good friends, and spent time singing songs. Everything went well until a LTTE fighter (C. Arunpandian) got killed by Sri Lanka Army in Lakshmi's home. Then the army started to threaten them, Manimekalai ran away from the place while Lakshmi stay there. The same night, Lakshmi set herself on fire. Later, Manimekalai joined the LTTE.
After listening to her tragic past, Subhash promises her to not call the police and he accepts to let her in the hospital ward for a month. The Tamil Nadu police receives very often information letters from the Sri Lankan government and this time it's about the rebel group staying in hospital. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
