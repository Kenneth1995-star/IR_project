Raja Vikramarka

Raja Vikramarka (Chiranjeevi) 26 is the prince of Skanda Dweepam, a small kingdom. As he is a prince, he is not allowed to live his own free life. His father Raja Bhupathi (Satyanarayana) 58 arranges his marriage with another kingdom's princess. She turns out to be nothing more than a sycophant, one without a brain or spine of her own. He leaves the kingdom with his trusted friend, Jockie (Bramhanandam), in order to live his own life. In the modern big city, he finds a friend and works as a mechanic, during which time he saves Rekha (Amala) 20 from two attempts at her life. Her uncle Vishwanatham (Raogopal Rao) 53 hires him as her bodyguard. Vishwanatham later reveals to him that he was in fact the assassin trying to kill her for her money. In order to thwart his plot, Raja agrees to handle the murder attempts, while at the same time trying to save her. After being kicked out of the house, Vishwanatham, along with Kanaka Rao (Gollapudi Maruthi Rao) 42 and Raja Kotappa (Kota Srinivasa Rao) 32 join forces to kill Raja and his parents. Raja saves the day and rules as king of his land.
