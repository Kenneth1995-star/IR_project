The Lure of Crooning Water

As summarised in a film publication,[4] Georgette Verlaine (Duke) is a favourite stage actress that Dr. John Longden (Buckler), who is in love with her, persuades to recuperate in the country as her life is ruining her health. He selects a pretty place called "Crooning Water" where she stays with Horace Dornblazer (Newall), his wife Rachel (Dibley), and their three children. The fact that there is one man who does not fall for her smiles drives her to try and win the admiration of Horace. When she finally gets him where she wants him, she leaves and returns to London. Horace leaves his family and follows her to the city, but she tells him that she did not love him but only admired him for the things he stood for: honour, fidelity, etc. Georgette starts her gay life anew and Horace goes back to his family where he is forgiven. The actress soon tires of her frivolous life and returns to Crooning Water, where she too is forgiven, and then returns to London to marry the doctor.
