The Bombay-based Varma family consists of two brothers, Ajay and Vijay. Their family have been lawmakers for generations, their grandfather was the District Magistrate, and their father was the Inspector General of Police. Now Ajay is a Judge while Vijay is the Superintendent of Police. Both live a fairly harmonious and honest lifestyle until Ajay hires a Secretary, Sandhya, who falls in love with Vijay.
