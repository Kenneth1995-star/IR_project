Mani Osai

An egotistic rich man (M. R. Radha) abandons his elder son (Kalyan Kumar) because of his physical imperfections. He tells his wife (Kumari Rukmini) that the baby was born dead. The man has another son (R. Muthuraman) who leads a lazy life, often getting into trouble. He falls in love with his cousin (C. R. Vijayakumari) who is very close to the hunchback, treating him like a brother. The hunchback becomes a hero who sacrifices everything, taking the blame for others' wrongdoing. He finally restores sight to the hero and dies. Only after the hunchback's death does the father tell the world that he was his firstborn.[1]
