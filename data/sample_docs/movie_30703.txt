Yuga

The story is about a scientist who stays at Kollimalai Hills to find ways and means to tackle the rocks that are to fall from moon and destroy the earth. The problems that he encounters in his mission forms the crux. It is a convoluted story that makes you to leave reasoning and logic in cold storage.
Narendran (Nassar) as usual, is good at his role. Swarnamalya gets an opportunity to show her acting talent. Unfortunately Rishi (Richard Rishi), who had a good outing in Naalai, recently just plays a second fiddle. Charuhaasan has nothing much to do.
The movie begins with Professor Narendran, who finds out that rocks from lunar craters would fall on earth and destroy the world soon. Narendran and his assistant Swarnamalya choose to keep it as a secret and decide not to create panic in the earth. They are joined by a group of students which include Rishi and 'Boys' Manikandan in accomplishing their mission. They come across a different problem. Swarnamalya's father (Charuhasan), led by a group of men forms a cult. They decide to die and plan to take revenge on the humans for polluting the world. Narendran and his team come to know of their plans. The rest is how they tackle both the problems.
