The Glass Key

Paul Madvig (Edward Arnold) controls crime and politics in the city, helped by the brains and brawn of Ed Beaumont (George Raft). As he throws his support behind Janet (Claire Dodd) Henry's father in a political campaign, Paul also plans to marry her.
Janet's brother Taylor (Ray Milland) is a gambler heavily in debt to O'Rory (Robert Gleckler), a gangster whose club Paul intends to put out of business. Taylor, who has been romancing Paul's younger sister Opal (Rosalind Keith), is found dead. The temperamental Paul falls under suspicion.
Ed pretends to betray Paul while offering to work for O'Rory's organization. He is beaten by Jeff (Guinn Williams), a brutal thug who works for O'Rory, and has to flee for his life.
Paul is going to face murder charges, but Janet knows who is really behind her brother's death. It's up to Ed to get her to reveal the truth.
