Mad Bastards

Years ago, TJ (Dean Daley-Jones) abandoned his wife and son, and as time passes his conscience tells him it's time he began facing up to his responsibilities as a father. TJ is an Aboriginal man living in Western Australia and has a weakness for alcohol and a habit of getting into fights. As it happens, TJ's son Bullet (Lucas Yeeda) is nearly as troubled as he is; at the age of thirteen, he's already been arrested for arson and instead of serving a sentence in a juvenile detention home, he is released to the custody of his Elders. Bullet isn't anxious to reacquaint himself with TJ, but both realize they need to settle their scores with one another, and Bullet's Grandfather Texas (Greg Tait) steps in to help.
