The Suspect

Twelve years ago in 1986, Don (Louis Koo) was imprisoned due to murder and the fact he did not testify against the mastermind Dante (Simon Yam) and his friend Max (Julian Cheung), who was also involved of committing the crime. Twelve years later, Don is released from prison and decides not to repeat the same mistakes and make a fresh start. However, Don receives a sudden call from Dante and Max, who force him to assassinate the candidate running for the president of the Philippines. Don rejects their request, but later discovers that the target has been assassinated. Don realizes he has been framed by Dante and begins to exile. Later, with the help of King Tso (Ray Lui), a legion soldier who was hired to take down the murderer, and Annie (Ada Choi), a female reporter, Don reveals the evidence of Dante's crime and cleares himself.
