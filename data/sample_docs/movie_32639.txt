Paathasala

Five friends: Adi, Raju, Sandhya, Surya, and Salma, who have just completed their engineering are at crossroads about their career choices. Also, they realize that the moment has come to leave each other and move into the big, bad world. So, they decide to take one final road trip to each otherâ€™s house.
They hire a swanky van, and start their fun filled journey to these villages. On their route, they discover a lot of things they did not know about each other. They also realize what they want to do with their lives. Rest of the story is as to what happens during their visit, and how the harsh realities change their lives upside down. In short, the film is about how the road trip becomes a Paathasala of sorts and prepares them for the big journey called life.
