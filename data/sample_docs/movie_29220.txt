Kavalai Illaadha Manithan

Muthu (Chandrababu), a lawyer with no care in this wicked world, makes it his mission to solve the problems of fellow human beings. (Incidentally, Kannadasan's real name is Muthaiah.) In sharp contrast, his brother (Radha) believes in creating trouble for those around him, especially the women. Their affluent father (Balaiah) believes only in money and is not bothered about other things in life. He fixes the marriage of his wayward son with a woman Sivakami (Rajam), but she is in love with a young man (Mahalingam). True to his wont, he seduces a poor woman (Rajasulochana) whom he abandons with a child.
Muthu takes all the necessary steps to correct the wrongs done by his brother (Radha) and succeeds in bringing the lovers together, and also marries a young woman (Vijayalakshmi).
