Jeevan Dhaara

Sangeeta (Rekha) is a young, strong and idealistic girl. She is 25 years old, but unlike her contemporaries, she is still not married. The reason for this is her being a member of a poor family. Her father left the family; Her mother is an old homemaker; Her younger sister Geeta (Madhu Kapoor) is a young widow; Her nephews have to go to school while their father, her brother (Raj Babbar) is an inebriated and unemployed man. All the members of this family live in one little house. She is the only one who takes care of them. She is the only one who works to support the family. She is concerned for her nephews' future and makes her best to bring them up and educate them.
However, secretly, she dreams of the day when she could also have her own family, husband and children. Three men enter her life, namely Amol Palekar, Kanwaljeet Singh and Rakesh Roshan, but destiny has something different for her. Will this day come ever?
