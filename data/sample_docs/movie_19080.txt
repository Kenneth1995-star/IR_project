The Flanagan Boy

A shady promoter (James) spots a young boxer (Wright) and takes him under his wing, in an attempt to launch a comeback into prizefighting. He secures the backing of a wealthy Italian (Valk), but problems start to arise when the fighter becomes romantically involved with the millionaire's wife (Payton).
