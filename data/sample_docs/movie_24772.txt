Kab? Kyoon? Aur Kahan?

The movie opens with the killing of a rich man (Murad) in an accident staged by his adversaries. Then starts the world tour of Asha (Babita), the daughter of the victim. She happens to come across Anand (Dharmendra) during her sea-journey and they fall in love (quite naturally). When she is back home, attempts start on her life too. Apparently, it's her greedy uncle (Pran) only who is masterminding everything because he wants to usurp all the wealth of hers by eliminating her. Being unaware of her uncle's evil designs but quite aware of his licentious nature, Asha happens to kill him one night when he tries to molest her close friend Lata (Ashoo). On one hand, Anand is investigating the death of her father in his capacity of a C.I.D. officer, on the other she herself becomes a murderess who now has to get rid of the dead body of her uncle in her bid to escape the law. After many interesting incidents and twists in the story, the mystery gets unravelled.
