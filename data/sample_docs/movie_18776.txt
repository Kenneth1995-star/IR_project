Master of Bankdam

The film is the story of Bankdam, a small Yorkshire mill run by the Crowther family around 1860. It prospers and grows under its patriarch owner, Simeon Crowther. After family upheavals the firm goes through several crises under the management of his sons Zebediah and Joshua, who tend to oppose one another. Joshua dies with many others in a mill collapse, partially blamed on his brother Zebediah. Joshua's role is taken over by his son Simeon. The old patriarch, Simeon, dies. Zebediah with ill health retires to Vienna for treatment, leaving his son, Lancelot Handel, with power of attorney in his absence. Things at the mill deteriorate. In the final scene a fatally ill Zebediah returns and, with a mob outside the door, makes amends and entrusts Bankdam, not to his own son, but to Simeon, as he realises that he is the only person that can save Bankham.
