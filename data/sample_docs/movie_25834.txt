Bhishma

Paro (Vani Viswanath), her mother (Sulabha Deshpande), and her brother, Natwar (Johnny Lever), find an unconscious man near their town. They bring him to their house and nurse him back to health, only to find out that he has the mind of a 12-year-old child. They name him Bhola. Years pass, and Paro falls in love with Bhola (Mithun Chakraborty) for rescuing her from a molester. Before they can get married, Bhola is viciously attacked and left for dead by Paro's molester, and is hospitalized. While in the hospital, Police Sub-Inspector Abhimanyu Verma (Harish) discovers Bhola is not who he claims to be, but rather a homicidal maniac - named Bhishma - wanted for killing three policemen and is possibly masquerading as a 12-year-old child to hide from the police. The film is a usual action revenge for Mithun Fans.
