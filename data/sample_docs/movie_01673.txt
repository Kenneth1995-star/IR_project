Dangerous Corner

Robert Chatfield is having dinner with his wife, Freda, and four of their friends: Charles Stanton, his business partner; Ann Peel, who works at their company; and Robert's sister, Betty, and her husband, Gordon, who is another partner in the firm. As the dinner winds down, the subject of Robert's brother's suicide the prior year comes up. Robert's brother, Martin, had died from a gunshot wound, which an investigation had ruled a suicide, brought on by his guilt over stealing some bonds from their company, of which he was also a partner. But now, during their dinner conversation, certain comments made by his companions don't add up in Robert's mind.
As he begins to question them, Freda confesses that she had been secretly in love with Martin, and Ann reveals that she has been holding a torch for Robert for years. It was this unspoken love which caused Ann to not speak honestly at the hearing into Martin's death, for she thought that it might have been Robert, not Martin, who stole the bonds. Betty announces that she has been in love with Charles, who then confesses to having stolen the bonds, in order to satisfy a debt owed by Betty, even though he has been in love with Ann.
Ann then confesses that Martin did not commit suicide as everyone thought, but that she accidentally shot him. Unable to deal with the guilt of all the confessions, Robert leaves the room and shoots himself. After a moment, time returns to the moment that the conversation started after dinner, but this time Charles begins by declaring his love for Ann and asking for her hand in marriage, who accepts.
