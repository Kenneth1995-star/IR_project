Char Dervesh

Three Derveshes are praying at a shrine, each has a wish to fulfil but that can't happen till a fourth one arrives. A white horse appears with a rider, and it is the fourth Dervesh who is seeking to reedeem himself. His name is Qamar (Feroz Khan). Qamar has been a care-free person getting into trouble for his innocent misdeeds and basically a source of worry for his two covetous brothers. He sees the beautiful princess Nargis Bano (Sayeeda Khan) and falls in love with her. However he's caught by the palace guards and whipped and sent to exile. His brothers throw him off the ship they are travelling in and he lands in an underwater sea kingdom. He sees a woman turned to stone up to her neck. There is another princess, Hamida, imprisoned there by an evil magician. The stone woman turns out to be the mother of the two princesses and she wants Qamar to marry the imprisoned princess. However, Qamar fails to fulfill her demand and in turn, the stone-lady (Ratnamala) gets angry and she turns Qamar's skin black and thus, he meets the other three derveshes. After the stone-lady comes to know of the actual facts, she forgives him and the problem with the skin is reversed. He's now in a dilemma as he has to decide which princess to marry. Several action and chase scenes follow, with sword fighting and flying on magic carpets to rescue the princess and finally marry the one he loves.
