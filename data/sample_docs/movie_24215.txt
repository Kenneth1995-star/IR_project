Dharmatma

Eknath (Bal Gandharva) concentrates on giving charitable and caring help to people especially those of the untouchable caste. This goes in variance against the vindictive Mahant (Chandra Mohan) who opposes such practices. Things come to a head when at a prayer meeting, Eknath feeds the untouchables first, before the Brahmins, as would be the normal custom. Eknath does not differentiate between castes and eats at their house too. This enrages the Mahant and he has Eknath ex-communicated. Eknath's son Hari Pandit (Kale) has joined the people and the Mahant who oppose his father's practices. Eknath finally arrives at Kashi and defends his behaviour by reciting verses of his poems to Pradayananda Shastri.
