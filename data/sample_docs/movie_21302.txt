The Comedian

Ed works an office job as a cancer insurance call-center operator by day,[1] a job he seems not to enjoy, especially as he's in his early thirties. The movie details the hardships faced in London as Ed moonlights as a stand-up comedian,[2] and shows the different dilemmas faced by bisexual men as Ed experiences turmoil - emotional, sexual and professional - and ends up retreating into himself to observe his environs.[3] His personal life is also in disarray as he is torn between a newfound love, artist Nathan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), and his best friend and flatmate Elisa, who develops issues with the boyfriend.[4]
In the end, Ed arguably sees the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel after a taxi ride with a Zimbabwean driver, feeling sparks of hope in his seemingly failing life.[5]
