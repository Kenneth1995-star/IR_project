However, a couple of days later, the couples resolve their issues and become friends again. On Vikram's birthday, the two men get drunk and Vickey asked whether he could become Raj for one day and they go in each other's house.

He decides to search Vikram's house, only to be interrupted by Vikram, who calls the police and then reveals that everything was planned in advance. Raj escapes in Vikram's car with Priya.
Raj finds a boarding pass that belongs to Sonia Bajaj, which states that Sonia arrived in Zurich on 29 Decemberâ€”however, Sonia was supposedly murdered that night. Raj suspects her to be the woman he saw with Vikram, traveling to Geneva together. In Geneva, Raj meets an insurance officer who is trying to find evidence that Vikram was involved in the death of his wife, in order to receive her life insurance payment of $100 million.

In the climax, Vikram explains the whole plan to Raj - the woman he saw in Mauritus was his wife Sonia Bajaj (Mink Brar), while the woman with him that Priya and Raj were introduced to in Switzerland is his girlfriend Neeta (Bipasha Basu). Vikram, a struggling musician, married the wealthy and glamorous Sonia, and convinced her to take out an insurance plan of $100 million on herself. He then formulated a plan with Neeta to have Sonia killed so that they could collect the money.
In a turn of events, Raj takes Vikram to a computer and shows him his empty bank account. Raj tells him that he had guessed his password, "Everything is planned", something that Vikram used to say a lot, and used it to transfer the money back to the insurance company. Raj also reveals that everything Vikram said had been recorded. A fight erupts between the two and Neeta dies in the conflict.

He chases Priya to kill her, too, but Raj is able to save her and a fight ensues between him and Vikram. Vikram dies when he is impaled by an anchor.
