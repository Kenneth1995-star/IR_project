Sex Jack[23]

Set in the near future, a small gang of revolutionary students are hidden away by a small-time thief. While they are hiding, all but the thief take turns having sex with an unhappy (and perhaps unwilling) girl who has had the misfortune to get involved with them.
About Sex Jack, K≈çji Wakamatsu said: "I wanted to show how the revolutionary movements are always infiltrated by the moles working for the government."[2]
