Runaway Blues

South Taiwanese triad member Lam Kong (Andy Lau) flees to Hong Kong after killing another triad leader (Blackie Ko) in a motorcycle race. He hides in the house of triad leader Nip Ching's (Chan King-cheung) mistress Sue (Shirley Lui), who is also the lover of Nip's underling Chiu Kwai (Sunny Fong). Nip thinks highly of Kong due to his hard work and living up his demand to assist Chui Kwai in trading.
Detective Ronny Cambridge (Robert Zajac) has been investigating Nip and Chiu's illegal activities and after his informant was recently killed, he blackmails Kong to be his new informant. Kong becomes pressured and Sue comforts him and gives him encouragements. As they spend time together, Kong and Sue gradually fall in love with each other.
During a deal of Rolex watches between Chiu and mainland Chinese triad Wah (Kelvin), the goods suddenly disappear and Wah suspects Kong has stolen them. Being persecuted by Wah, Kong flees to Guangzhou, before finally heading to Macau and plans to bring Sue with him back to Taiwan.
