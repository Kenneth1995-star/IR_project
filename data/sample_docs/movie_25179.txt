Shakka

One dark night, some dark businessmen, the enemies of our nation, entered the house of an honest country-loving person to save their lives. They ruthlessly murdered Shakka's parents in front of him. Shakka, only twelve years old, somehow managed to escape and ran for his life. He did not stop in this race of life; he had a long way to go, his destination unknown â€“ his aim was to find those murderers, those masked killers who had killed his parents and he had to unmask them. Days passed, years passed, childhood went and came manhood; Shakka had all the power of youth and also the blood of his brave parents, which was like lava bubbling within him; impatient to turn his enemies to ashes. In order to reach those murderers, Shakka had to cross all those paths filled with crime and poison; those paths which change a man to a devil. Shakka also became like a devil in his neighborhood and he became one of the group of devils who was responsible for the murder of his parents. On this road of crime, Shakka met Meena, who was a renowned thief. She too, like Shakka, was lonely in life, brought up by a criminal and left alone on those roads of crime. When Shakka was very near to his destination, he learnt that the real culprit behind the murder of his parents was Seth Dharamdas, who is now leading the life of a very rich nobleman. On one hand, Shakka's heart was filled with hatred because of the bloody incident in his childhood, but, on the other hand, was a streak of love. Meena's love; that Meena with whom he had spent several hours playing at the seaside, he used to collect all kinds of shells for his Meena and see the wonders of fate. Today, the girl thief Meena is the same Meena of his childhood days. Shakka had found his lost love, but when he came to know that his Meena was the daughter of the real murderer Seth Dharamdas, he was stunned because there was one Meena in Seth Dharamdas' house and Shakka believed her to be the real Meena.
