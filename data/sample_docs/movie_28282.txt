Orange

Yakobi (Kalabhavan Mani) is an orphan who works in a dairy farm, where he drives his own lorry on a contract basis. Orange is the name of his lorry. He falls in love with Saritha (Lena) and gets married. His sisters neither relatives did not know about this marriage. Later Saritha gave birth to babygirl Orange (Diya Babu ). Whenever he goes to his native place, his relatives enquire why he is still staying as a bachelor.
As usual when Yakobi was returning to Kambam after visiting his native place, a man asked him a free lift. While continuing their journey Yakobi came to know that his name was Jith (Prakash Nath) and he was coming to attend an interview for a job in the dairy farm where Yakobi is working. But unfortunately they could not reach the farm within time. Yakobi somehow made arrangements to get a temporary job for Muthu in the dairy farm.
When Yakobi meets one of his old friends Baboottan (Biju Menon), he invites him to his house and this serves as the turning point in the story.
