The movie opens when Narain (Shaan), an acclaimed writer, becomes a winner of the Booker prize for one of his works. While he dedicates the honour to his wife Kavya (Niveditha), a flashback reveals some secrets in the coupleâ€™s life.
Narain first sees Kavya playing her violin in a musical theatre. After the performance, Narain and Kavya meet, where he asks her to sign his violin. Narain and Kavya become friends soon after and they fall in love. On day, when Kavya comes to Narain's home, she notices his awards for his books and realises that Narain is an esteemed writer. Narain asks Kavya to marry him right there and she agrees.
Coming to the present, the husband and wife are now in the United States, where they meet Bujji (Abhinay), a childhood friend of Kavya. Narain soon starts to write another book, and when Kavya reads it, she finds out that it is about their personal life, including intercouse. When she confronts her husband, Narain replies that it will only look like a story to the outside world. Narain continues to write his book about how a husband tortures his wife. To truly understand how it feels, Narain tortures Kavya, asking how it felt each time. One day, Bujji comes to their home, where he observes how Narain mistreats Kavya. Knowing that Bujji knows his secrets, Narain attacks Bujji and kills him. Finally, Kavya tries to flee her husband but gets caught. Narain wants to do another "experiment" on her and hangs her from their ceiling fan. Just before death, Narain snaps the rope to ask how Kavya felt and when she did not reply, he decided to hang himself to see how to feels like. On doing so, Narain kills himself and Kavya is left alone.
