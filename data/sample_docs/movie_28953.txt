Vijayalakshmi

The story revolves around a man's greed for money, the exploitation and ill-treatment of women, (with the complicity of his wife) and his scant respect for the rights or feelings of women in general. The de-monitisation of 500, 1000 and 10,000 rupee notes by the government of the day leads to the climax of the story.[2]
