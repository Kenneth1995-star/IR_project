Mister Drake's Duck

Mr. Drake (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) inherits "Green Acres Farm" in Sussex, in the English countryside, and moves in with his new American bride Penny (Yolande Donlan). Through a misunderstanding, Penny unexpectedly finds herself the proud owner of 60 ducks. She is further astonished when one of the ducks begins laying radioactive eggs. As the news spreads, the Drakes find themselves under siege by the army. "Green Acres Farm" is designated a prohibited area, and all its inhabitants and visitors made prisoners. "Operation Chickweed" is formed: a bureaucratic concern wherein the army, Navy and Air Force all lay separate claims upon the atom-age duck.
