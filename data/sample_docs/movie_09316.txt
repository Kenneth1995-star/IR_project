Tracks

1st Sgt. Jack Falen (Hopper) returns from the Vietnam War to the United States to escort a friend's body for a hometown burial. Once in the US, Jack travels across the country via train (hence the film's title), where he meets the mysterious Mark (Stockwell) and alluring university student Stephanie (Power). During the trip, Jack falls in love with Stephanie, but destroys the relationship through constant flashbacks to combat.
