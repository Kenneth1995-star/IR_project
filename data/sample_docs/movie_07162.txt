The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock

Artie Pinsetter (Lou Costello) is a junk collector and amateur inventor who lives in the desert town of Candy Rock. Artie's fiancée, Emmy Lou Raven (Dorothy Provine), is exposed to radiation in a cave and is changed thereby into a thirty-foot giantess. When Artie nervously explains to his betrothed's rich uncle that she has gotten "big", the uncle misunderstands "big" as "pregnant", and insists that Artie marry her immediately. Artie eventually manages to restore her to her normal size.
