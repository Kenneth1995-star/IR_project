Brick Lane

The film tells the story of Nazneen, who grew up in rural Bangladesh, in the district of Mymensingh.[3] At 17 she has an arranged marriage to Chanu Ahmed, who is twice her age. They soon move to Brick Lane in London, the centre of the British Bengali community.[4] She leaves behind her sister and her family home.
Married to a man she does not love, Nazneen lives vicariously through the letters she receives from her sister about her carefree life. The film picks up the story after Nazneen and her husband have lived in a small flat for 16 years and been raising 2 daughters.
Nazneen becomes filled with desire for a young, good-looking clothing worker named Karim who visits her flat, and they have an affair.[5] The movie takes place following the 9/11 attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda, and reflects a period of heightened racial tensions in Britain as well.[6] The Bangladeshi Muslim community was becoming increasingly religious, as reflected in the character of Karim.
