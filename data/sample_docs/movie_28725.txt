Priyatama

Parsha belongs to a community in Maharashtra, known as "Potraj", who are said to be messengers of Goddess Lakshmi, and devote their entire lives to this service. This community travels around and makes temporary shelters at each village, feeding themselves on grains donated by villagers, as they are not allowed to live normal lives. Members of Potraj carry a whip, called Korda, and regularly practice mortification of the flesh, as a way to please Lakshmi.
Parsha soon meets Gauri, a sweet young village girl belonging to a very rich family. Her father is Sarpanch of that village. Initially Gauri is scared of Parsha, but soon she begins to see a different person in him and they both start developing feelings for each other. Their mutual feelings get stronger with every meeting. Soon, they realize that they cannot live without each other, and conflict arises when they face rough reactions from both ends of society.[4]
The film draws inspiration from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet.[5]
