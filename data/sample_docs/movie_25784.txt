Inspector Jai (Ajay Devgn) is an upright and fearless cop who is given the job to take down the criminal empire of Raj Solanki (Naseeruddin Shah). Jai and his accomplice Inspector Sandhya (Juhi Chawla), who also happens to be his love, start taking down Raj's empire with gusto. But Raj's cronies and benefactors are not the only ones to be upset by this.
Raj has problems of his own. He does not want his son (Deepak Tijori) to turn into a criminal like him. Raj is also aware of his minion's (Gulshan Grover) discontent; he wants to start many criminal activities that even Raj will not do. Raj tries to stop Jai without applying pressure or brutality, only to meet Jai's mother (Reema Lagoo) and realize that Jai is his son. Now Raj finds himself in a real tight spot.
Jai's mother does not like Jai trying to take down Raj, but Jai is determined. After some time, Jai learns about his relationship with Raj, but continues his job nonetheless. Raj's legitimate son and his minion try to take down Jai individually, without knowing the secret.
