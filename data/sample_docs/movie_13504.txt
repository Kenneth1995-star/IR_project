Lost & Found

Restaurant owner Dylan Ramsey (David Spade) is head-over-heels in love with his new neighbor, a French cellist named Lila (Sophie Marceau). In a desperate attempt to garner her affections, he kidnaps her beloved pet dog and offers to help her find him on a phantom dog hunt. A wrench is thrown in his plans, however, when the dog swallows his best friend's diamond ring, and things get worse for Dylan as Lila's ex-fiancee, Rene, arrives to win her back.
