Jallikattu Kaalai

Gopalakrishnan (Prabhu) works in a mill owned by Sundara Gounder (Malaysia Vasudevan). Radha (Kanaka), Sundara Gounder's daughter, returns to the village after her studies and falls in love with Gopalakrishnan. Loose Gounder (Anandaraj) is a vicious man who has raped and killed women.
Knowing of his daughter's love, Sundara Gounder arranges her marriage to Radha with a fraud. Her fianc√© agrees to leave Radha for one night with Loose Gounder. Gopalakrishnan cancels the marriage and the fraud and is arrested by the police. Sundara Gounder apologises to Gopalakrishnan and Radha is married to her lover.
Loose Gounder kills Gopalakrishnan's calf and the wedding night is therefore cancelled.
Radha misunderstands a conversation between Gopalakrishnan and a woman who lies that she had a sexual relationship with her husband.
At the wedding night, Gopalakrishnan says that the women lied but Radha does not believe him. In fact, the woman was forced to lie because Loose Gounder raped her before and he had promised to marry her. Loose Gounder kills her and Gopalakrishnan goes to her house. Radha thinks that Gopalakrishnan killed the woman.
Gopalakrishnan finds the culprit. Loose Gounder kidnaps him and his wife. Loose Gounder is killed by Gopalakrishnan's cow, the mother of the killed calf.
