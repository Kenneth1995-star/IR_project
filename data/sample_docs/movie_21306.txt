Riot on Redchurch Street

Set in the hipster-underworld of Shoreditch, East London, 'Riot' depicts a bisexual love-triangle that unravels between a British Rock and Roll Manager (Hazeldine) and two of his clients - a French pop-singer (Paradis) and the front-man from a local punk band (played by newcomer, Rhys James).
As racial tension bubbles on the streets of Shoreditch, stragglers outside a gig ignite a full-blown race riot on the steps of the Redchurch Street mosque and before the night is over our love-triangle will end in blood and redemption.
