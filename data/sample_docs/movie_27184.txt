Maha Prachandaru

In the movie, the idol stealing gang tries to involve Vishnuvarshan but he gives the idol back to the temple from which they stole after plotting from a long time. The final fight between themselves sees Vishnuvardhan going back to the temple head's daughter who is a worshipper of the God and she would have died due to his betrayal but his love was real. Ambareesh (her brother) arrests Vishnuvardhan who accepts it as he is guilty of betraying her more than he stealing the idol.
