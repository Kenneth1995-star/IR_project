Political Rowdy

Vithal (Mohan Babu) is a rowdy who commands respect from state heads like CM. He hates women and remains a bachelor even at the age of 45. Kaveri (Charmme Kaur) is a naughty college student. She grabs the attention of Vithal and makes him fall in love with her. She does it for fun, though she is in a love with another guy (Abbas). Vithal proposes her, but she could not say no to him due to fear. The rest is all about how all ends well.
