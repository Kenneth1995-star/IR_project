Ladki

Rani (Vyjayanthimala), a feminist, is best friends with Kamini (Anjali Devi), much to the disapproval of her mother, since Kamini's father (Chittor V Nagaiah) had married a woman of low caste. They meet Raja (Bharat Bhushan), a medical student, and Kishore (Kishore Kumar). After the initial tussle, Raja and Kamini fall in love while Kishore likes Rani. Rani goes to Colombo for the University Sports Tournament, and while winning every single event she enters there, she injures her leg and is in hospital. Meanwhile, Kamini and Raja marry secretly, since he knows his woman-hating, upper caste father will never agree to this marriage. Captain Sundar, Kamini's childhood friend, comes from Rangoon and wants to marry Kamini, but is shattered as he finds out she is married to Raja. Raja's parents are told of the wedding and they call him home asking him to forget the marriage and marry a girl of their choice. Raja refuses and goes back to Kamini and misunderstands the situation when he sees Kamini with Sundar. He returns to his parents and tells them he's willing to marry the girl of their liking who turns out to be Rani, having returned from Colombo. Kamini, devastated by Raja's betrayal, decides to commit suicide. Finally with Kishore and Sundar's help, everything is sorted out and Raja is re-united with Kamini, while Kishore marries Rani.[1]
