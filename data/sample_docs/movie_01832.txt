Bar 20 Rides Again

Hoppy gets a letter from the father of Johnny's girlfriend asking for help against rustlers. He also asks Hoppy to bring Red, but not Johnny because Margaret is now enamoured with an Easterner. Johnny doesn't believe it and, without Hoppy's knowledge, he races off to marry Margaret. Hoppy and Red follow 3 hours behind to help the rancher against the rustler known as "Nevada".
