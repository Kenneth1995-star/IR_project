Ki Kore Bojhabo ...Tomake

Vikram (Tanveer), a poor guy falls in love with Sapna (Chaya Singh) seeing her innocence, her humanity and her charisma but hell breaks loose on him when he comes to know of her marriage. The first impulse is wrath, hatred and accusations of being cheated but then love overpowers everything and he goes on to love her even more.[2] Vikram comes to know of Sapna’s poor and deplorable state and also her miserable condition, all thanks to her mentally sick and physically handicapped husband Bissonath (Arjun Chakraborty) who has reached this state following an accident. Bissonath also has a sister called Aparna (Payal Karak) whom he loves very much and she too has a boyfriend Uday (Riwk). Both Bissonath and Aparna leave no opportunity to disgrace and insult Sapna. Now Vikram’s only aim in life is to take Sapna out of that hell and bring to her life all the happiness in the world. But then, are things as simple as they appear or there is something very ugly behind all this? Will Vikram be able to achieve his goal? And what fate are each of them going to see? What should be the outcome of everything?[3]
