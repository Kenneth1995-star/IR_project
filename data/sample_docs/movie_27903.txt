Naran

Mullankolli is a rustic remote village in northern Kerala. Velayudhan (Mohanlal) is an orphan who came floating during floods and he was brought up by Valiya Nambiar (Madhu) a do-gooder and a feudal landlord of the area.
Velayudhan grows up into a riff-raff, drunkard and a local rowdy with a good heart. He hates injustice and has set his own rules for the villagers who are scared of him including local moneylender and politician - Member Kurup(Jagathy) and Gopinathan Nambiar (Siddique), son-in-law of Valiya Nambiar who wants to rule over the village in his own way.
When Velayudhan plants a staff, it means that it has his stamp of authority. The only man who he listens to is Valiya Nambiar and to a certain extent Kelappan (Innocent) who looked after him as a child. The villagers including Kurup and Gopinathan regularly bring goons from outside the village to eliminate Velayudhan but they fail. There are three women in his life - a prostitute Kunnummel Shantha (Sona Nair) old flame Janaki(Devayani) and Kelappan's daughter Leela (Bhavana). But things turn bleak for Velayudhan due to the machinations of Gopinathan which leads to the climax.
