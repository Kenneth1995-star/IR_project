Miracle in Soho

Michael Morgan (John Gregson) is a labourer working with a gang, mending a road in Soho, when he meets Julia Gozzi (Belinda Lee), an Italian barmaid, and they begin an affair. But When Michael's job in Soho is finished, the affair is over, so Julia visits a local church and prays for him to come back. A miracle occurs when a burst water main brings the return of the road gang.
