Sri Krishnarjuna Yuddham

The film begins with Sage Narada (Kanta Rao) gives the Parijatha flower to Lord Krishna (N.T.Rama Rao) who in turn presents it to his consort Rukmini (Sriranjani Jr). This annoys Sathyabhama (S. Varalakshmi) and Krishna tries to pacify her. Balarama (Mikkilineni) decides to perform the marriage of Subhadra (B. Saroja Devi) with Duryodhana (Mukkamala) despite objections from his wife, Revathi (Chayadevi). Bowing to Subhadra’s wish, Krishna performs her marriage with Arjuna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) without Balarama’s knowledge. Meanwhile, Gandharva king Gaya (Dhulipala) after obtaining from Brahma the boon of eternal fame, is returning to his kingdom in his airplane. Unaware that Krishna is paying obeisance to Sun God, he spits betel leaf which falls into Krishna’s praying hands. An angry Krishna swears to kill him. Fear-struck Gaya runs for protection. Narada tells him to seek protection from Arjuna. Without ascertaining facts, Arjuna assures him protection. To keep to his word, Arjuna wages a war with Krishna. In order to the save Earth from disaster, Lord Siva (Prabhakar Reddy) appears and stops their war. Krishna pardons Gaya.
