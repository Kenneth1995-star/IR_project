On the day of his engagement, he meets with an accident, and mistakenly strays into the Pakistani side of Kashmir from his own home in Srinagar. A native girl called Henna (Zeba Bakhtiar), falls in love with him, amidst the controversial Indian-Pakistani tension on Kashmir, which leads him to be suspected by the Pakistani police of being an Indian spy.
