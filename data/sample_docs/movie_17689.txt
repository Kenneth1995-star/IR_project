 Magic Pudding, TheThe Magic Pudding

In the South Pole in the year 1957, Bill Barnacle and his crew are cruising across the waters when their ship crashes. The crew run out of food and are starving and their evil shipmate Buncle wants to eat Sam (The first mate). However they discover a magic pudding called Albert that can talk, change flavour on request, lasts forever and demands that they continue to eat him. The crew are divided over the pudding but two of them resolve to protect and look after it. Ten years later in 1967 a young koala named Bunyip Bluegum discovers that he is not an orphan and sets out on a quest to find his parents, Meg and Tom Bluegum. The old crew and the koala paths cross on the road when Bunyip stumbles into the middle of an attempt by thieves to steal the everlasting pudding from Bill and his first mate Sam.
