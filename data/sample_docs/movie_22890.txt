Angels Wear White

Mia (Vicky Chen), a teenager, works as a cleaner in a motel in a small seaside town. One night, while manning the reception for her co-worker Lili (Peng Jing), she witnesses an assault of two 12-year-old schoolgirls by a middle-aged man. Through the surveillance TV, she sees the man forces himself into the girls' room and records the whole incident with her hand phone. Mia keeps quiet for fear of losing her job. However, for one of the victims, Xiaowen (Zhou Meijun) realises that her troubles have only just begun. As Mia and Xiaowen find themselves in ever harrowing circumstances and nowhere to run, they have to work together to find their own way out.[2][3][4][5]
