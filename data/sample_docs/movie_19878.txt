The Magnificent Two

Two British Action Men travelling salesmen are sent to the South American country of Parazuellia to sell their goods. During the train journey Eric accidentally opens a door leading to the death of the returning British educated Torres who is the figurehead of a revolutionary movement and a government secret policeman arresting him. Upon arrival in the city of Campo Grande, Eric is mistaken by the revolutionaries for Torres, and though they discover the death of the real Torres they pay Eric and Ernie to maintain Eric's impersonation of Torres to lead a revolution to oust a brutal dictator.[2] However once the revolution is successful Eric gains an inflated opinion of himself.
