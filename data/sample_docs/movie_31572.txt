Sarangadhara

King Narendra was ruling the Vengi country with capital of Rajamahendri. He had a son by name Sarangadhara. The king had a second wife Chitrangi and he was very much affectionate towards her. He had a bitter enemy, his step mother's son by name Vijayaditya.
One day Chitrangi, invited her step son Sarangadhara for feast. But as Sarangadhara was leaving for hunting he ignored the invitation. His step mother was very angry towards him and it was brought to the notice of Vijayaditya by the intelligence agency. Vijayaditya made bad propaganda of this accusing of an affair between Sarangadhara and his step mother with the sinister motive of creating conflict in the house of Rajaraja Narendra. Without proper inquiry, King Narendra ordered the chopping off the hands and legs of innocent Sarangadhara. It was mandatory to obey king's orders to and so the punishment was meted out to the prince in the mountain forest.
Sarangadhara was lying in a pool of blood screaming in pain drawing the attention of Meghanadha a devotee of Siva, who immediately rushed to Sarangadhara and did what ever he could to alleviate the pain and advised Sarangadhara to pray to Lord Shiva and get his blessings. Lord Siva impressed by Sarangadhara's prayer gave his lost legs and hands and made him a beautiful person.
