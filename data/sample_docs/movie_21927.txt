Dance Me Outside

On the Kidabanesee reserve in Northern Ontario, there is Silas Crow (Ryan Black), a young man confused about his direction in life. He is uncertain about taking an automobile mechanic's course in college. His general confusion with life is most readily evident in his appearance. He wears an old, ratty black hat resembling a fedora, a strange assortment of cargo pants, as well as a long, black trench coat. Frank Fencepost (Adam Beach) is Crow's best friend, and Sadie Maracle (Jennifer Podemski) is his girlfriend.
A young girl from the reserve is murdered by Clarence Gaskill (Hugh Dillon), a white man's sentence is light; the community to demand vengeance.
