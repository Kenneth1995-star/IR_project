Miss London Ltd.

This musical comedy playing in wartime London, stars Arthur Askey as Arthur Bowman alias Miss London, the name of the escort agency he inherited from his mother. Soon he is joined by his new American partner, Terry Arden (Evelyn Dall), as she inherited the other half of the Agency from her parents, who just arrived from abroad. The first thing she accomplishes is to clean up the office, together with her partner. Then they have to renew the files of escort-Ladies. In order to do so, each of them goes searching in different places. Arthur Bowman is assigned to the railway station and finally he finds railway clerk Gail Martin (Anne Shelton) to hire. The opening sequence of the film features the latter singing "The 8.50 Choo Choo For Waterloo Choo" at Waterloo station before she is recruited by Bowman for his agency. As usual, Ronald Shiner's character of Sailor Meredith plays a decisive role.
The film features a surreal self-parodying sequence in which Bowman, in order to gain entrance to a hotel, pretends to be the famous Arthur Askey, using some of his choice catchphrases. Other spoofs include Askey and Dall doing a routine as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and, with Shiner in addition, as the three Marx Brothers.
