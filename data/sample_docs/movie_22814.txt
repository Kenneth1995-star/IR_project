Three

Shun (Wallace Chung), a thug, is shot in the head by a cop due to miscommunication during an interrogation and is taken to the hospital. In the hospital, he claims human rights to refuse surgery to remove the bullet inside his head in order to bide time for his underlings to rescue him. The detective (Louis Koo) in charge sees through Shun's scheme but decides to play along so as to capture his whole gang once and for all.
