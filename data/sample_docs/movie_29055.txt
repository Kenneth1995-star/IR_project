Ponni

The story is about a less privileged woman (P. Santha Kumari) left with two daughters. She loses one girl (‘Baby’ Chandrakumari, later Padmini) who is found by a wealthy man (D. Balasubramaniam). He changes her name to Kanmani and brings her up in luxury. She becomes proud. The struggling mother sends the other girl Ponni (‘Baby’ Asha, later Lalitha) to work in Kanmani’s house. Kanmani ill treats her and once pushes her down the staircase, which injures Ponni badly, and she lands in hospital. The rich man has an adopted son Sundaram (Kaushik). His brother, a never-do-well (Sriram), misbehaves with both Ponni and Kanmani. In the process, Ponni tries to save her sister, and lands in prison, accused of murder! However, the truth comes out and they all live happily thereafter.[2]
