Cheerful Weather for the Wedding

Today is Dolly's (Felicity Jones) wedding day, and her family is arriving at the manor house with all the cheerfulness, chaos and petty grievances that bubble to the surface at such gatherings. Trouble soon appears with the arrival of Joseph (Luke Treadaway), Dolly's lover from the previous summer, who throws her feelings into turmoil. To her mother's (Elizabeth McGovern) exasperation, his presence threatens to upset the design she had for her daughter's future. Dolly, for her part, just can't decide whether to run away with Joseph or start a new life in Argentina with her husband to be.
