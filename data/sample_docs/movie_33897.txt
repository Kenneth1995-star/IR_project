Galactic Armored Fleet Majestic Prince: Genetic Awakening

In the year 2110, humanity has expanded its frontier into space in its drive for new resources. Advances in genetic engineering research led to the establishment of the MJP (Military Junior Pre-Academy) project, which saw the creation of genetically enhanced humans known as the Evolved Children, developed with the intention of allowing humans to adapt to the new frontier. However, when Earth finds itself under threat by an alien race called the Wulgaru, human forces decide to have the evolved children deployed as soldiers to fight on the front lines.
Team Rabbits, a quintet of evolved children whose troubling lack of teamwork and common sense prevents them from reaching their true potential, are selected as test pilots of cutting edge mobile battle suits called AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device), powered by the Juria System, a cutting edge technology whose effectiveness in combat is increased according to the survival instincts of whoever uses it.Ep. 4 As they join forces to overcome their personal weaknesses and achieve their true potential, the members of Team Rabbits (nicknamed Majestic Princes because of their association with MJPEp. 2) eventually assume a key role in mankind's effort to thwart the alien invasion of Earth.
