 The Family That Preys

In the prologue, socialite Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) hosts the wedding of Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) -- the daughter of Charlotte's best friend, Alice Evans (Alfre Woodard) -- and Chris Bennett (Rockmond Dunbar), a construction worker. The couple is congratulated by Charlotte's son, William (Cole Hauser), and his wife, Jillian (KaDee Strickland), who had eloped instead of letting Charlotte plan an elaborate reception for them. William suggests that the newlyweds contact him for employment with the Cartwrights's successful Atlanta construction company after their honeymoon.
Four years later, Andrea's sister, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), is married to Ben (Tyler Perry) and looks after Andrea's three-year-old son for extra income while working at their mother's diner. Pam is troubled Andrea doesn't help their mother more financially, though Andrea has designer clothes and a new Mercedes. Andrea is actually enjoying the perks of being in an extramarital affair with William.
Chris dreams of opening a construction firm with Ben, but Andrea ridicules Chris's aspirations. At the bank, Chris is rejected for a loan application, but discovers his wife has deposited nearly $300,000 in a secret account. Andrea catches Chris going through her hidden financial records one night. She tells him that the money is bonuses she received from William and that she has the right to some privacy from her spouse. She refuses to finance his business.
William is determined to take the family business from his mother, believing the $500-million deal he recently closed will prove his capabilities. Charlotte hires Abigail "Abby" Dexter (Robin Givens) as COO and determines the company will have to front $25 million to make William's deal viable. The only way to raise the money is for Charlotte to sell 10% of her shares, leaving her with a minority vote. William tells Abby that Charlotte's vote and his vote combined will give the Cartwrights continued control; Abby advises Charlotte to sell her shares.
Charlotte asks Alice to go on a road trip in the vintage turquoise Cadillac convertible Charlotte has bought. Alice eventually agrees, and they head west without a set route or schedule. Charlotte introduces Alice to honky tonks and male strip clubs; Alice reciprocates by taking Charlotte to a communal baptism. One night, Charlotte becomes stressed out over her camera and reveals she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She has been told nothing can slow her mental decline.
At the company gala, both Jillian and Abby discover Andrea and William's affair. William later fires both Chris and Ben after they ask him for money to start a construction business of their own. Abby warns Andrea of the repercussions of the affair that will likely result her termination from the company, only for Andrea to rebuffs this as she fervently believes William will protect her. Convinced that they were marital assets, Chris takes the money from the hidden account and pays deposits to start a construction firm with Ben.
Charlotte and Alice return to Atlanta. Andrea confronts Chris for taking her $300,000. She says he and Ben will never be like William. Ben states that nobody is trying to be like William and that Andrea can't see that because of the affair. Andrea admits to Chris that the money was from William, her lover. Chris angrily slaps her, sending her flying over the counter. Andrea tells him to keep the money and move out. As Chris brings up their son, Andrea says William is the father.
Alice tries to persuade Andrea to end her affair with William and reconcile with Chris, explaining to her that their affair will not last and William will never marry her, begging her to stop before her life is destroyed. Andrea refuses to believe her, and says if that happens, she will enjoy the ride on the way down.
William is plotting to take over the family firm. Although they had never been close, Jillian goes to Charlotte for advice. Charlotte offers little consolation, but reminds her that she is a woman scorned without a prenuptial agreement, and as such can divorce or reconcile and be okay either way. Jillian warns Charlotte of William's plan to have the board vote her out.
Chris confronts William on a job site and punches him. Jillian then confronts Andrea in the hotel room where trysts with William were held each Wednesday, and warns her to stay away from her family.
Charlotte calls a board meeting and fires William with the support of the Calvary Company, a silent investor revealed to be Alice. Alice has been receiving financial guidance for years from Nicholas "Nick" Blanchett (Sebastian Siegel), a homeless man she frequently fed at her diner. Earlier, it is explained that Nick had been a regular customer who left large tips until he lost his job, wife, and custody. Nick still visits the diner regularly and pays Alice with solid investment advice. Later, it is revealed that Nick had been working for William and fired without cause.
In the parking lot, Andrea approaches William, unaware of the recent events and expecting him to leave Jillian for her. Instead, he ends their affair and drives away, ignoring her claim that her son is his. Charlotte takes a deadly combination of pills and calls Alice, who has an emotional breakdown. Alice gives the eulogy at Charlotte's funeral.
The movie ends with Chris and Andrea parting, with the paternity of their son left unclear. Chris is now wealthier, after opening a firm with Ben, while Andrea is sad and lonely. Nick is wealthy and buys a house. William & Jillian reconcile, slowly salvaging their marriage. Alice decides to sell the diner and drives off in the car that Charlotte left her (with a photo of her and Charlotte taped to the dashboard) to start life anew on the road.
