Mappillai

Aarumugam makes a blazing entrance, gatecrashing a marriage to abduct the bride. Geetha, the bride's friend, gets him arrested but then learns that he had rescued the girl from a forced marriage. Further revelations about him that he is a gold medalist and has a good heart make her fall in love with him. After some convincing, Aarumugam reciprocates too. Meanwhile, Aarumugam's sister is in love with the son of a rich woman Rajarajeswari. When Rajarajeswari learns of this, she foists a false case on her and puts her in jail. It is then that Aarumugam has his first encounter with Rajarajeswari. He then learns that she is none other than Geetha's mother. He also invites Geetha's mother Rajarajeswari to his marriage. At that time he calls his friend (played by Chiranjeevi) and tells him that during his marriage there are goons who will try to stop it. He requests Chiranjeevi to look after the rowdies and he comes, fights off the goons, attends the marriage and goes. Since Aarumugam has married Geetha against her mother's wishes, Rajarajeswari vows to separate them while Aarumugam vows to prevent that and make Rajarajeswari understand that love and affection are more important than money.
