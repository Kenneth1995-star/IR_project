Arputham

Ashok (Raghava Lawrence) is a good-for-nothing youth whose only aim is to enjoy life by drinking and dancing the night away with his friends. To this end, he even swindles his father (Pyramid Natarajan) regularly off of his hard earned money. He meets Priya (Anu Prabhakar) and soon her beauty and outlook on life make him fall for her. When he proposes to her, threatening to kill himself if she doesn't accept his love, she promises that she would accept him if he makes a name for himself. Spurred by her words, Ashok starts working hard. But what he doesn't know is that Priya is already in love with Arvind (Kunal) and that her promise to him was just to prevent him from taking the extreme step on her rejection.
