Ladies Should Listen

The switchboard operator Anna Mirelle (Frances Drake) in an apartment building falls in love with businessman Julian De Lussac (Cary Grant), who lives in the building, whom she has gotten to know only over the phone. When she discovers that the man's current girlfriend Marguerite (Rosita Moreno) is actually part of a scheme to swindle him out of an option of a nitrate mine concession in Chile he bought, she devises a plot to save him and expose the con artist, Marguerite's husband Ramon Cintos (Rafael Corio).
De Lussac's friend Paul Vernet (Edward Everett Horton), who is in love with millionaire's daughter Susie Flamberg (Nydia Westman), has to face a great jealous rage, as Susie has fallen in love with De Lussac and has brought in her father to force him into marrying her. He will come out of it by giving Vernet a lesson on how he should act with Susie to impress her. De Lussac gets rid of Marguerite and ends up with Anna.
