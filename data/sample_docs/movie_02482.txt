Woman Against Woman

Unhappy in his marriage, attorney Stephen Holland decides to get a divorce from his pretentious wife Cynthia, despite concern over how it will affect Ellen, their young daughter.
Cynthia sets out to make her ex-husband's life miserable. She first deceives Stephen's mother into siding with her, Mrs. Holland suggesting that Stephen let the little girl remain solely in Cynthia's custody for a while. Stephen must leave on a work-related trip to Washington, D.C., so he reluctantly agrees.
At a reception for his friend Senator Kingsley, he meets Maris Kent and becomes smitten. They are soon married and move back to Stephen's hometown, but Cynthia conspires to ruin their lives any way she can, even having friends snub Maris at the local country club.
Away with her daughter at a remote inn, Cynthia schemes to make Stephen abandon his wife by pretending that their daughter Ellen is seriously ill and needs him. Stephen's wife and mother decide to accompany him to the inn, where all three discover a carefree Cynthia dancing while Ellen is perfectly fine. Cynthia is revealed to all what kind of person she is.
