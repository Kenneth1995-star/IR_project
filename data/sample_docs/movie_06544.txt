Glory

Agnes Tilbee and granddaughter Clarabell are excited about their Fairwood Farm's new foal, which they name Glory, although because it's a filly, her chances of becoming a championship racehorse aren't great.
The farm has financial difficulties. Clarabell is attracted to wealthy Chad Chadburn, who allows Glory to board and train at his stable. Chad is said to be engaged to Candy Trent, a rich snob whose fast car sometimes spooks the horses.
Agnes can barely afford her feed bill, which is why in spite of having parted ways, her former trainer Ned Otis pays the $50 she owes. Clarabell is heartsick when Agnes says the horse will need to be put up for auction. She enters Glory in races, but the filly isn't ready yet and always loses. Glory also goes lame, requiring care and a long rest.
A singer, Hoppy Hollis, takes an interest in Clarabell, who joins him on a song called "Glory' that becomes a success and earns them money. Agnes loses the horse in a poker game to Sobbing Sam Cooney, who is Chad's trainer, but Chad arranges for her to win the horse back.
Neighbors put up the entry fee for the Kentucky Derby so that Glory can be entered. Ned returns to train her, and Glory's surprising victory is a happy ending for all, including newly in love Clarabell and Chad.
