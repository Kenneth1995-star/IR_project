Show Me

When two squeegee kids, Jackson (Kett Turton, Walking Tall) and Jenna (Katharine Isabelle, Ginger Snaps) descend upon Sarah (Michelle Nolden, Martha, Inc.) and her luxury sedan, the fuse is lit on a tense cat and mouse tale of captors and captives. Sarah is forced to continue her trip to an isolated cottage where the twisted trio bait and entice one another in a reckless search for truth. Show Me plunges us into a maze of mystery, desire, memory and self-sacrifice.
