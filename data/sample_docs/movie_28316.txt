Husbands in Goa

Three husbands (Jayasurya, Indrajith and Asif Ali) are on a trip to Goa to take a break from their messy married lives with their dominating wives (Rima Kallingal, Bhama and Remya Nambeesan). During the trip, they meet a husband (Lal) who is on the verge of a divorce, which becomes a turning point in their lives. Their vacation in Goa, how they hook up with three young ladies and how their wives come to know about it, forms the rest of the movie.[4]
