Priya (Monisha), a rich girl, is in love with Sundar (Raja), a poor youth. Priya tries to elope with him but she fails and her father (Vinu Chakravarthy) and her mother (Srividya) lock her in her bedroom. From there, Priya witnesses the murder of Shanthi (Yuvasri) by her husband Sabapathy (Nizhalgal Ravi) in the opposite building. She takes photos of this murder and Sabapathy notices this act. She shouts from her room, but her parents ignore her thinking she is shouting because she has been locked up in her room.
Next day, all friends and relatives come for Shanthi's death. Her parents arrive and ask Sabapathy what happened. He explains that Shanthi complained of chest pain and before he could call doctor she passed away. Gopi (Ganeshkar), Shanthi's brother, only knows that his brother-in-law tortured his sister for a long time. In the past, Shanthi used to tell Gopi that her husband behaves like a caring and loving husband in public but in private they used fight a lot. She tells Gopi that she suspects her husband has affair with someone. Remembering this, Gopi shouts that Sabapathy killed his sister but all others subdue him since they consider Sabapathy as a perfect gentleman. Gopi requests his parents to conduct an autopsy on his sister's body, but his parents ignore this plea and cremate her body. Gopi files a complaint secretly against Sabapathy. However, Sarath (Sarath Kumar), an honest police officer, gives up the case due to the lack of evidence.
Sabapathy begins to pressure Priya for the negative. In the meantime, Priya's parents decides to marry Priya to their relative. Priya tells the murder's scene to her maid Sornakili and she gives her the negative. Sornakili later gives the negative to a photographer and the photographer blackmails Sabapathy for money. Afterwards, Sabapathy kills the maid, the photographer and he burns the proofs. Sarath investigates on these murders.
