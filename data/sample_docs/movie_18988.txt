Mystery Junction

A middle-aged woman recognizes her fellow train passenger, mystery writer Larry Gordon, from a photograph. Suddenly they hear a scream. The train door has been opened and snow gets in. Gordon and the lady visit all the passengers in the railway carriage. One of them is Steve Harding, handcuffed to police officer Peterson. Harding is to appear in court the next day, charged with the murder of a young woman. The other passengers are a broker, an engineer, a woman and a young man. All of them, in one way or another, have a connection with Harding.
The ticket collector has been knocked out by an assailant who has taken his uniform coat and posed as him. Two female stowaways are hiding in the guard's van.
It is determined that the scream they heard came from another police officer, who was also escorting Harding.
The passengers leave the train at a junction (hence the title). They gather at a deserted railway station, where officer Peterson is shot and killed, enabling Harding to be released by accomplices. It transpires that he real target was Harding, who orders mystery writer, Gordon, to find out who the shooter was.
