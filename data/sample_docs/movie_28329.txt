Chettayees (ചേട്ടായീസ്)

The whole story happens over two days, when five friends get together to celebrate New Year's Eve. The friends are John (Lal) a lawyer, Kichu (Biju Menon) a percussionist, Roopesh Krishna (Suresh Krishna) an actor, Bava (P. Sukumar) a chef and Babumon (Sunil Babu) a government employee. They are having a blast at John's apartment on the last day of the year.[1] John, who is not in good terms with the apartment association goes to the new year party and ruins the party. The apartment owners who were looking for a way of taking vengeance, finds that a lady was staying at their apartment overnight and calls the police to charge them against immoral trafficking.
The girl turns out to be Merlin (Miya), the wife of Kichu who was there to spoil her husband's New Year party. She was unhappy about the friendship of John and Kichu and was upset that Kichu spends more time with John than her. After the police leaves, John and Kichu ends up in a fight and they both part their ways. It turns out that John acted that way to rebuild Kichu's married life and that plan works. They keep their friendship going without Merlin knowing about it but in the final scene we understands that she knew about it all the time and she has no issues with it anymore.
