Udayanan Vasavadatta

Udayanan (Balasubramaniam), the king of Vatsa, meets Vasavadatta (Vasundhara Devi) and the two fall in love. Udayanan is presented a divine Elephant by Indra, which leaves him due to a sin he commits. He goes on a quest in search of it, leaving behind Vasavadatta in another kingdom where she teaches music and dance. During his search, a rival king imprisons him by luring him into his kingdom with an Elephant made of precious stones. While Udayanan is imprisoned, another rival king attacks his kingdom. Udayanan, after facing many hurdles and crises, succeeds in defeating both his rivals and happily reunites with Vasavadatta.[2]
