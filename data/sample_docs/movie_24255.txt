Seth Bansilal (Mazhar Khan) posing as an ordinary man Govindlal, takes part in a crossword puzzle competition; he wins the second-prize trip to Kashmir. The first prize is won by an unemployed youth, Sumant (Motilal). Bansilal, accompanied by his niece Shashi (Sabita Devi), lands up at a hotel in Kashmir at the same time as Sumant. Due to some misunderstanding Sumant gets the room Bansilal's wife (Sunalini Devi) has booked for him. Bansilal opts to stay in a common cheaper room as Govindlal. Several comic situations follow along with Sumant and Shashi falling in love and Sumant getting black-mailed by a girl in the hotel, Manjri (Khursheed). The misunderstandings are finally cleared with the lovers getting united.
