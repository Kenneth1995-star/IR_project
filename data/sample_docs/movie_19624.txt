It's Trad, Dad!

Craig (Craig Douglas) and Helen (Helen Shapiro) are teenagers who enjoy the latest trend of traditional jazz along with their friends. The mayor and a group of adults dislike the trend, and move to have the jukebox in the local coffee shop taken away.
With the help of a character who also functions as an omniscient narrator, Craig and Helen journey to a TV studio to find a disc jockey and organize a show to gain popularity for the music. They meet David Jacobs, who agrees to help, and several artists who are willing to perform. Upon hearing the news of the upcoming performance, the mayor decides to stop the bands' van by any means necessary.
When the show is scheduled to start, Craig and Helen find that their disc-jockey and musicians have not yet arrived, so they decide to find local talent within the crowd of guests. The interim acts stall the crowd long enough for the true performers' bus to evade a series of traps set by the city council. Just in time, the performers reach the stage and put on their act for the citizens. The film ends with the town's kids and teens enjoying the music and the adults grudgingly accepting it.
