The plot revolves around the lives of a few people around an ancient Syrian church in a Kuttanadan village called Kumarankari. Solomon (Fahadh Faasil) is in love with Shoshanna (Swathi Reddy) who is the daughter of a wealthy contractor. Solomon is a failed band member however he is the son of the famous Estapan ashan, who was renowned in Kerala for his clarinet playing abilities, and died in a boat accident. Fr. Vincent Vattoli (Indrajith) comes to the church as a new recruit to the parish. He learns about the relationship and tries to unite the couple. At this time, the marriage of Shoshanna gets fixed. Solomon attempts to elope, in vain. They are caught by Shoshana's parents and Solomon is mercilessly beaten up. The people of Kumanamkari and the neighboring town then place a bet in which the St. George's band has to win in order for Solomon's marriage to occur. It was said that Shoshanna would be married to Solomon if they win the competition with Solomon leading the band. The band takes intense practices and wins the bet. Solomon gets married to Shoshanna while Solomon's band master dies. At that night Shosana's father backs out of the bet. Him, the evil old parish priest and Solomons uncle are haunted at night by St. George at the time when they were destroying the church. They all came to the realisation that Solomon had divine powers on his side and they stood aside from Solomon's life as obstacles. The next day a call comes to the church informing that the new Priest Fr. Vincent Vattoli is taking charge. The Kumarangiri folks now come to know that Fr. Vincent Vattoli was actually the saint himself who appeared in front of them.
