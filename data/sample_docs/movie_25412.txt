Purnima is raped by a stranger (Shakti Kapoor) in a train and is too ashamed to talk about the incident. She becomes pregnant and her parents find out. Her father (Pinchoo Kapoor) dies of shock upon hearing this. Since it is too late to abort the baby, she gives birth to a baby boy and her mother gives him away to a stranger.
After some day, Purnima gets married to Vijay (Suresh Oberoi), but ironically the same child ends up in their care, and they name him Rajan (Arjun).
Years later, Purnima gives birth to another child, named Aman. The two boys grow up, and sibling's rivalry prevails to such an extent that they eventually fall in love with the same woman, Meena. Things become increasingly complicated so much so that a member of their family ends up being killed, and another arrested.
