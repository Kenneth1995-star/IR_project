My Dear Kuttichathan 3D

The character 'Kuttichathan' is formed on the basis of the specialties of a deity popularly known as 'Chathan' who is being worshiped mainly in the south Indian state, Kerala. There are cruel magicians everywhere in the world. One of them is the Karimbhootham (black magician), who enslaved an invisible spirit with his magic spells, whom he calls Kuttichathan ("Little Ghost" in English and "Chhota Chetan" in Hindi). Two boys and a girl befriend Kuttichathan by accident and release him from the grip of the magician.
On the way Kuttichathan meets Ashish, a member of the police, who is after Karimbhootham.
They understand that this Chathan is friendly to kids and is a very good friend. Therefore, the girl promises to keep Kuttichathan in a house for two reasons: one, her father drinks too much, so she wants Chathan, who is a very good magician, to make him himself, as her mother has died, there is no one to control him; second, Chathan, being a small boy, also drinks a lot. He could drink all that her father drinks, thereby changing her father's attitude.
At the same time, the cruel magician wants the Kuttichathan to lay hands on a treasure. Even though the magician is the owner of the Kuttichathan, he is burnt and killed by the Chathan in the climax. Chathan turns into a bat and flies away.
