The Last Safari

Miles Gilchrist (Stewart Granger) is a big game hunter in Africa. He goes on a safari to shoot an elephant who killed his friend. He is accompanied by Casey (Kaz Garas), an American millionaire intrigued by Gilchrist's story, and Grant (Gabriella Licudi), Casey's half-caste girlfriend.
Miles feels he is to blame for his friend's death, and has to redeem himself. He sees hunter Alec Beaumont (Liam Redmond) refusing to eat with Grant, an indication of how life is different in Africa. Casey and Miles help to save a group of white hunters ambushed in a Masai village.
Later, Miles and Casey are nearly killed by a herd of charging elephants, led by a rogue elephant. Casey refuses to fire knowing Miles also won't shoot, but is not afraid. Casey bids Miles farewell and leaves Africa and Grant, who stays behind in the hopes of finding a new benefactor.
