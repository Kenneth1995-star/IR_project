Second Fiddle

Deborah and Charles, very much in love, are young executives at the successful Pontifex Advertising Agency. Deborah is highly sought after as a brilliant TV executive, while Charles is regarded as thoroughly efficient. The Pontifex board of directors however, will not allow any married women on their staff. Charles’ fiancée Deborah worries about her future with the company. Eventually the company reverses their policy, enabling newly-wed Deborah to continue working. When Deborah wins a lucrative advertising campaign in New York, and Charles seems to be overlooked for a promotion he was confident would be his, Charles feels his masculinity threatened. Whilst Deb is away in New York, Charles becomes involved in a flirtatious relationship with his attractive secretary Pauline.
