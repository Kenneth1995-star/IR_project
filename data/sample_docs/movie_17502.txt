Pacific Banana

Martin is a pilot who sneezes whenever he is aroused and loses an erection. He works for an airline owned by Sir Harry Blandings, whose wife tries to seduce Martin but then claims he made a move on her. Blandings sacks him but gets him a job at broken down Banana Airlines, where he flies with handsome Paul, who sleeps around despite being engaged to two sexy airline hostesses, Sally and Mandy.
Martin makes several attempts to have sex, but constantly fails to get an erection, even with the help of the beautiful Candy Bubbles and her female friends. Paul constantly cheats on Sally and Mandy but they keep going back to him. Martin is constantly chased by Blandings school girl daughter, Julia. Eventually Julia tells Martin she loves him which cures his impotence and he can have sex.
