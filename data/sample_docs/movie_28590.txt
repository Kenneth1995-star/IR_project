Sughu and his family were rich and Kamal was their steward. Sughu's father was an alcoholic, so Kamal used that and turned over his employer's land and house in his name. Kamal now lives a life of luxury and his cunning knack helps him to amass more wealth. Sughu is in love with Kamal's daughter Keerthi. He plans to make quick money through trafficking drugs to Qatar, a one time deal that could help him regain his family's honor and get his girl. However, matters doesn't go well, and he gets very less money compared to the amount promised. When going back to Kerala, he gets tied up with a penniless Half-Malayali Sheik in the airport. There is a murder case that has followed with the Sheik from Qatar. The identity of the Sheik, Sughu's own story of love, Kamal's greedy plans, and the murder case that has followed them to Kerala are all thick plot-lines which are explored.
