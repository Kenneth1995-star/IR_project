Bus Conductor

The story, set in the Malabar culture, revolves around Zakir Hussain aka Kunjakka (Mammootty). This bus conductor lords over the family that has a motley cast to it - mother (Bindu Panicker), sister (Poornima), her husband (Innocent), son (Jayasurya), daughters and his own sister Selina (Mamta Mohandas). Then there are his bus mates (Kalpana and Harisree Ashokan)and the villain police sub inspector Sajan George Adithya Menon.
Being a good man, Kunjakka is faced with all kinds of troubles and responsibility. On the one hand he has to take on the wily cop Sajan George, who also runs a bus company on the sly. Then the problems within the family come to hand. Najeeb’s (Jayasurya) dalliance with a local girl (Bhavana) ends in her becoming pregnant. But Najeeb goes to Dubai leaving the girl in the lurch. So the responsibility of looking after her also falls on Kunjakka’s shoulders. There are misunderstandings in the family and his only solace is Noorjahan (Nikita Thukral).
The story then is about how Kunjakka unties all the knots of distrust and disappointments. It is a story that is overweighed by treacle-soaked sentiments. In fact, the maudlin nature of the script makes you groan. Starting with Mammootty none of the artistes have let down the story. Every one chips in efficiently. But the director Vinu has chosen the wrong path. He gets himself tied up through over-the-top sentiments.
