Final Mission

The film starts with the murder of an honest industrialist, Jayabrata Chakraborty (Rajat Ganguly), as the result of a terrible plan made by three criminals - Ranabir Hazra (Shyamal Dutta), Binod Pandey (Shankar Chakraborty), and Manmohan Sawant (Raja Chattopadhyay). Formerly, Jayabrata was a close friend of Ranabir Hazra. Their relationship was strengthened by an unassailable companionship. Apart from that, Jayabrata’s wife (Irani Mukherjee) shared an extremely sympathetic relationship with Ranabir’s wife, Jui (Santana Bose). However, the harmony between the two families got spoiled as the greedy and cruel thoughts of Ranabir Hazra came to the forefront, with fumes of retaliation harboured by Jui against her own husband. Jui had thought of a deadly mission of avenging her husband. As a demonstration of her canny strategy, Jui deploys her own son, Rana (Ferdous Ahmed) along with Jayabrata’s son, Raja (Sanjay Banerjee) in the ferocious dynamic encounter against her own husband Ranabir. Emboldened by the momentum of Jui, Rana initiated the courageous campaign of exercising penal measures against the three conspirers - Ranabir, Binod and Manmohan.[1]
