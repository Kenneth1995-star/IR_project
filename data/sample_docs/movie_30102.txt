His uncle Maruthu and his daughter Rasathi (Vineetha) comes to his village, Rasathi is crazed of him and she compels him to marry her. In the meantime, Veluchami clashes with a rich landlord (Captain Raju) and his son Raja (Kazan Khan).
Finally, Veluchami accepts for the marriage and he promises to marry Rasathi. Chinnamma dreams to have lot of children. So Veluchami looks for a bribe but Periya Ayya refuses for her marriage because he promises to God that he will give her to the temple if she survived. Veluchami cannot accept it and he marries her by force to save her dreams.
