Full and Final

Rimjim is a painter, who looks after her grandfather's shop during the week and earns extra money as a street painter on weekends. It's through her painting that she meets Abith (Tanvir Khan), an cop who is chasing a criminal, but keeps Rimjim in the dark about his real work. The other man, Romeo (Shakib Khan), is an undercover police officer who found a soft spot for her and watches her from afar for some time. However, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career Romeo can only make small gestures to her while still staying in the shadows. Rimjim is dying to meet the man who leaves flowers on her doorstep every day, and built a bridge over a stream for her after she once fell in. Both men try to woo her from afar while still hiding their identities, as she remains alone but moved by these incredible gestures to her. It's only a matter of time before the undercover police officer and Interpol agent cross paths and things really begin to unravel in this action-fueled romance story.
