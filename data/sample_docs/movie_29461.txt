Rickshawkaran

In the early 1970s, at the end of a rickshaw competition the winner, Selvam (MGR), an ex-military officer, witnesses a murder, that of another driver of rickshaw named Manickam. With his girl Soussi in the arms, this one was chased, killed and burned on the spot by a notable of the region, merciless Kaïlasam (S. A. Ashokan). The latter imagines above the laws for a very good reason, he is defended by effective Dharmaradj (Major Sundarrajan) who is also his brother-in-law. Dharmaraj knows perfectly the weaknesses of the judicial system and does not hesitate to exploit them in defiance of the morality. Meanwhile, Selvam got back the orphan girl Soussi and wants now that justice is returned for the girl and his deceased father. But nice Selvam is very far from suspecting that behind this murder hides in fact a vast network, specialized trafficking in persons, especially women led by vile Kaïlasam. Noticing that the justice is ineffective, Selvam decides to tidy up there in his own way.
