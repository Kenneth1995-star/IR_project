Changayya (Subba Rao) is a wealthy Sowkar (businessman) whose son Satyam (N.T. Rama Rao) is studying in the city. His neighbor is Ramayya (Srivatsa). Changayya is affectionate towards Ramayya's daughter Subbulu (Janaki) and wants to make her his daughter-in-law. Satyam also likes this idea. But due to some conflict in the village courtesy Bangarayya, Ramayya becomes the main witness against Changayya citing Changayya's hand in some messy affair. The two families are thereafter estranged. They start off with petty fights, getting worse every day resulting in Satyam and Ramayya's son Narayana (Sivaram)..both ending up in jail after being framed. The local goonda Sunnapu Rangadu (S.V. Ranga Rao) plans to rob Changayya's place, but his plans are spoiled by Subbulu and Ramayya. Both the families end their differences thereafter and become friendly once again. At the end, Satyam and Subbulu marry and live happily.
