Seven Times Lucky

When a veteran grafter (Pollak) loses $10,000 of his boss’s money at the track, his talented young protégé (Balaban) devises a risky scheme to get it back. A low-budget film noir set in the underbelly of Winnipeg with plenty of twists and turns, 7 Times Lucky spins a fairly clichéd yarn with some sharp dialogue. The film's cast also includes Jonas Chernick, Babz Chula and Gordon Tootoosis.
