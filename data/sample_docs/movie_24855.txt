Raja Jani

The narrative begins with a young man, Raj "Raja" Kumar (Dharmendra), with a dreary past, in search of a young girl who could be placed in the palace as heir to kingdomâ€“ courtesy an arrangement with the scheming Diwan Gajendra Singh (Prem Nath). He finds one in a street dancer, Shanoo (Hema Malini), trains her up as a princess and presents her to the Rajmata (Durga Khote) as her long lost grand-daughter, Ratna. Rajmata is delighted to have her back, but not without doubts and misgivings. Now the familiar twists and turns take over, bringing into the plot the mistrusting father and son team of Gajendra and Pratap Bahadur with whom Ratna has to get married. But Raja has his own plans of ditching Diwan. The usual attacks and counter attacks follow, leading to the climax in the treasure chamber in which a lot of tomato sauce is splattered. Raja and Ratna carry out a well thought out plan, and the lovers are united by the grandmother.[3]
