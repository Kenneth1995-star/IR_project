En Kanavar

A wealthy man gets his son (Balachandar) married to his sister's daughter (Nandini), keeping his promise made to his sister on her deathbed. The young couple are in love, but the marriage does not prove to be satisfying for the husband who believes in romancing his wife all the time. The wife, a responsible homemaker, does not find the time for such, and the frustrated husband becomes smitten by a dancer (Chellam) whose sole aim is to enslave the victim and rob him of his wealth. The neglected, tradition-bound wife is burdened by her father-in-law's death, family responsibilities and the business failing due to her husband's waywardness. The husband is shocked to find that his father has willed that the property would go to him only when he reforms and unites with his wife. Abandoned by his mistress, he becomes mentally disturbed and wanders aimlessly. The wife sells the property to meet her husband's debts, and is eventually forced to live in a hut. However, wisdom dawns on the husband and after many trials and tribulations he learns his lessons and unites with his wife.
