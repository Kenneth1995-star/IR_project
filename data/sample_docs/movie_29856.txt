Inaindha Kaigal

Chandralekha (Srividya), a grieving mother, asks an ex-army man David Kumar (C. Arunpandian) to rescue her son Gunasekaran (Prabhakaran) who is locked-up in a military prison. But at the same time, the hideous criminal P. K. Roy (Nassar) appoints the fugitive Pratap (Ramki) to kidnap Gunasekharan from the prison. Both leave for their missions respectively, not knowing what surrender holds in his past and the fugitive takes this personal.
