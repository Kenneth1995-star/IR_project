The Sheriff In Town

Dae-ho is an ex-cop who is forced to quit his job when an impulsive bust left his partner stabbed and a major felon on the run. Five years have passed since that incident, and now Dae-ho runs a humble restaurant in his hometown Gijang. Never one to question his own superior strength, smarts and righteousness, Dae-ho has appointed himself the unofficial "sheriff" of the village, and assembled a dubious posse of locals to keep an eye on things. So when a face from Dae-ho's past re-emerges, claiming to have left crime behind and promising great things for the town, Dae-ho has his suspicions, and he is going to act on them.
