Soukhyam

Seenu (Gopichand) is a happy go lucky guy having a happy joint family. He falls in love with a beautiful girl Sailaja / Sailu (Regina) on a train journey from Hyderabad to Tirupathi and woos her. By the time Sailu agrees to his proposal, however, the obstacle in the story comes in the form of her father PR (Devan) who is an influential political broker in Kolkatta who wants his daughter to marry the Chief Minister’s son. So he kidnaps his daughter. The second issue is that Seenu’s father (Mukesh Rushi) is a modest man who wants to stay away from influential and violent people. He asks his son to stay away from this mess and move on with his life. On the other hand, unknowingly Seenu promises Bavuji (Pradeep Rawat) a local goon to rescue a girl whom he wants his son to marry because Bavuji has saved his father from an accident. Shockingly, Shailu turns out to be that girl and now he has to save Shailu from the clutches of Bavuji, PR and also ensure that she is not forcibly married to anyone. After some routine fights, Seenu gets the girl and lives happily after.
