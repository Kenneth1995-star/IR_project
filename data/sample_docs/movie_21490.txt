Trash

Trash follows three Brazilian street teenagers in Rio de Janeiro; Raphael, Gardo, and Rat (Jun-Jun) who spend their time picking through litter in the hope of finding useful waste. One day they discover a wallet whose contents will bring them into conflict with the brutal local police force as they find themselves unlikely whistleblowers in a city rife with corruption.[5] Rather than turn the wallet over to the authorities for a reward, they follow their faith-led belief to do what is right in the face of adversity. As the plot unfolds, one step after the other these teens persevere through unbearable challenges and circumstances.
