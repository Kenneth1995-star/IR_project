Sivappathigaram

Professor Elango (Raghuvaran) comes to his native village near Theni, with his college-going daughter, Charulatha (Mamta Mohandas). He has taken voluntary retirement from his college service and has come to live in his ancestral house. He plans to do research on folk songs and release a collection as a book. His student Sathyamoorthy (Vishal) assists him in this venture. Charu falls for Sathya, on keenly observing his intellect, humaneness and social awareness. Meanwhile, elections are announced to the State Legislature and the parties start finalizing the candidates for the constituencies. When the candidates start filing nominations, the dreadful things happen. Some candidates from both the major parties are murdered and all the candidates get jittery. A lot of candidates withdraw from the fray fearing death. The parties are in a fix on what to do. The police are on the trace out for the killer. The Election Commission postpones the elections.
When the police tighten their noose and tie loose ends, the killer is traced. The trail leads to Sathya, and it is found that he is aided in this bloodshed by Elango. The police arrest Elango. At the same time, Charu reveals her mind to Sathya during their travel to Hyderabad. Sathya reveals his undercover deeds. He also tells her about the bitter and gory events which forced himself and Elango to resort to this task of cleansing the society of the current breed of dangerous, inhuman and selfish politicians.
Sathya escapes from the police's net and makes another attempt at the Minister. Whether he succeeds in his attempts and was he able to send out the message correctly to the people forms the final pulsating moments. The final moments have been shot well in the Annual Azhagar festival in Madurai.
