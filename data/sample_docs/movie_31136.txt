Dayalan (Samuthirakani) is a newly appointed teacher of a government school in Vanthaarangudi village near Thiruvannamalai city. He is unhappy with the education system and is also worried about the pitiable condition of education of government schools. After joining the school, he tries to change the environment of the school. This is not welcome by Singaperumal (Thambi Ramaiah) who is Assistant Head Master (AHM). Dayalan's decision for the change does not go well with other teachers and students as well. But Dayalan's good moves were slowly noticed by Pandian (Junior Balaiah). Slowly Dayalan gets popular among the class students. In between, there is love between Pazhani (Yuvan) and Arivazhagi (Mahima Nambiar). Pazhani's Father is also a teacher in the same school. Singaperumal was waiting for a turn to take revenge on Dayalan. In these situation, Arivazhagi was sexually abused by somebody. Singaperumal files a case against Dayalan as a culprit. After Arivazhagi opens the statement to the police that another teacher is her abuser, Dayalan was released. Dayalan organizes an inter school competition between schools. Dayalan's school gets first place because of Arivazhagi's and Pazhani's hard work. After that, Dayalan gets attacked by mobs who were arranged by Singaperumal. Dayalan gets admitted in the hospital. All the students, teachers go to the hospital to see Dayalan and they were denied to see him by the hospital authorities as Dayalan is in very critical condition. Then arrives his wife and inspires the students to study for the coming exams. Students study well and they top their district and the movie ends with Dayalan giving the responsibility of HM to Singaperumal. So he reforms and apologizes to Dayalan. Then Dayalan goes to the next village to reform another government school.
