Young Lochinvar

In Scotland, a young knight, Lochinvar, insists on marrying Ellen, the woman he loves although she is betrothed to another. Undaunted, Lochinvar seeks Ellen at a ball at Netherby Hall to save her from a forced marriage. Asking first for a dance, he sweeps her off her feet onto his horse and rides away with her.
