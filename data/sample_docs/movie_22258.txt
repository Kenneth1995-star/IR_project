BumRush

BumRush was inspired by real events that happened in Montreal.[3] Bumrush refers to "storming into an establishment." After Montreal police conduct a series of raids against a criminal biker gang and the Italian Mafia, rival street gangs rush in to fill the void. The Kingdom, a bar, sees a new bloody chapter in the Quebec underworld, as the "IB 11" gang conducts a series of attacks on the bar that force the owner to hire five extraordinary men under the leadership of "L'Kid" to confront the gangs.
