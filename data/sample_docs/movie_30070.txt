Meanwhile Prashanth's sister Lakshmi is a famous criminal lawyer nursing a sad past and wanting revenge against Sujatha, a police officer and her husband Jai Shanker, a judge.

His daughter also pines for Prashanth, and there is this inevitable love triangle. Mohini and Prashanth are soon in love forgetting the initial skirmishes, but suddenly one day Mohini accuses Prashanth of an attempt to molest her. It turns out that she does this to dishonor Prashanth and his sister Lakshmi, as Lakshmi is Sujatha's professional rival. After a few such confrontations, Lakshmi decides to get Prashanth married to Mansur Ali Khan's daughter. But suddenly Prashanth has a change of heart as Mohini threatens to commit suicide, but gives in to his sister's wishes.
On the day of the wedding, Jai Shanker confronts Lakshmi and reveals that Mohini is indeed Lakshmi's daughter.
