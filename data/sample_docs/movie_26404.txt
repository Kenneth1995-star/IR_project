Shikhar

The story is about Gaurav Gupta (Ajay Devgn), a successful businessman, who started with nothing and believes that only money can fuel his ambitions. When he interests himself on building a tower in an abandoned village, he makes his mind up and agrees to build it at any cost, with the support of a crooked politician Amrit Patil (Manoj Joshi). However, the owner of the land, Shrikant Vardhan (Javed Sheikh) does not accept the tower to be built. Therefore, Gaurav tricks Shrikant's son Jaidev (Shahid Kapoor), who is infected by the get-rich-quick virus, to join his scheme.
Jaidev, while respecting his father's philosophy, falls hook line and sinker for Gaurav's gilt-edged dreams. Gaurav uses his girlfriend Natasha (Bipasha Basu) to charm Jaidev by pretending to be in love with him so that he supports them instead of his own father. Meanwhile, Shrikant hopes that his son will return to his roots. Gaurav and Natasha even trick him by pretending to be a construction/ad agency partnered with actor John Abraham. Jaidev falls for the plan with Gaurav blackmailing him along the way. Soon after learning about Gaurav's plan, Jaidev tries to stop him but he is attacked in the process. Jaidev realises his mistakes and apologises his father and tries to fight against Gaurav. After learning this, a furious Gaurav sets the land on fire, but Gaurav eventually saves the land and the hostages. Soon Gaurav and Amrit Patil are arrested for their crimes and village land is saved. Gaurav reconciles with his father and he starts to help the latter in his business.
