Bayo

Sharon (Patricia Phillips) and her ten year old son Bayo (Stephen McGrath) reside in the small settlement of Tickle Cove, located on the shores of Bonavista Bay, Newfoundland. Their family has lived there for multiple generations. But, Sharon despises her small town life that she has there. It is Sharon's dream to move to Toronto so she can forge a new start, which would provide her and Bayo with a better life. Sharon is inspired to move to Toronto because it was where her deceased mother was born. She leaves her large suitcase trunk that is full of clothes in the centre of the foyer in her house. This is a symbolic gesture signalling that the move will soon become a reality.
Sharon hates her father, Phillip Longlan (Ed McNamara), as much as living in Tickle Cove because he forced her and her mother to live there. Phillip subjected them to a life there so he could pursue his passion. Phillip is a fisherman who spends most of his time on a commercial fishing vessel. He supports Sharon by providing her with enough money to survive, but not enough that would allow her to follow through on her dream of leaving.
However, Bayo does not want to leave, especially since he would leave his grandfather behind. Bayo loves the sea and wants to spend his entire life by the water. Bayo never met his father, who lived and died by the sea. Phillip tells Bayo various stories about sailing, which gives Bayo the fantasy of rowing across the Atlantic to Portugal.
When Phillip visits Bayo and Sharon, Bayo begs his grandfather not to give his mother enough money that would provide them with the opportunity to move to Toronto. As Phillip grows older he ponders his immediate future and the implications of Bayo learning more about his father.
