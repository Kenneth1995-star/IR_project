Owning Mahowny

In 1982, Toronto bank employee Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given access to bigger and bigger accounts with his promotion to assistant branch manager. His boss trusts him, but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon skimming larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to Atlantic City, where he is treated like a king by a competent casino manager (John Hurt). Mahowny's girlfriend, fellow bank employee Belinda (Minnie Driver), can not understand what is happening. Mahowny's criminal acts come to light when Toronto police begin to investigate his longtime bookie (Maury Chaykin).
The movie's focus is on Mahowny as a characterâ€”how his compulsion drives him and all the domino effects it has on the rest of his life. The love story between Mahowny and Belinda and the inclusion of other finely drawn characters such as hapless casino employee Bernie (Chris Collins) put the emphasis squarely on the gambling addiction, not on the flash and sizzle of big casinos or multimillion-dollar frauds.
