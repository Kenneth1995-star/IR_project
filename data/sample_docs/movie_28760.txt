Nagrik

Nagrik is set against the political backdrop of Maharashtra.[4] Shyam Jagdale, the chief political correspondent of a leading Marathi daily called 'Aaj Mumbai' does an important expose in his political column 'Nagrik'. This triggers off a series of events that uncovers the unholy nexus between politics, business and the media. Plans of Vikas Patil, the new rising star on the political horizon, are thwarted. Shyam becomes suspicious at the turn of events and smells a bigger conspiracy. But treading the path of truth has never been easy or forgiving.
