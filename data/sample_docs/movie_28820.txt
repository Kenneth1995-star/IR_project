Mera Pind

Mera Pind is the story of a well-to-do Non-resident Indian Navroz Singh Lamba, who is played by Navjot Sidhu, who has chosen to settle in his native village and spread the message of empowerment and entrepreneurship among the village youth. Led by Himmat, played by Harbhajan Maan, the youth set off a revolution in the development of the village. The story inspires Punjabis who are increasingly opting to settle abroad, to undertake business in their own villages and cities. Mera Pind also includes a story of a young man seeking his love but has been shielded from the father of the woman he loves.
