Guna Sundari

UgraSena is the king of Dhara Nagaram. He has three daughters, Rupasundari, Hemasundari and Gunasundari.
Gunasundari is the youngest. Their mother died when Gunasundari was born. UgraSena brings up the 3 girls with utmost care. After the girls have grown up, during a chat between father and daughters, the elder two daughters say father is the most important person in a girl's life. However, Gunasundari differs from them and says the husband is the most important person in a girl's life. Father Ugrasena gets angry with her. He marries the two elder daughters to their cousins. But, in order to teach Gunasundari a lesson, he marries her to an aged pauper who is also a deformed person.
After marriage, the king learns that the pauper is actually a young prince but suffers due to a curse. The king orders Gunasundari and her husband to go away from his kingdom. They go away and live in a hut outside the kingdom.
The king become ill. The native physicians says his illness can be cured only with a rare gem called Mahendra Mani. Gunasundari's husband goes in search and succeeds in finding it. He is turned into a bear due to a curse. But the two elder sons-in-law robbed the gem from him and give it to the king who then gets cured.
Gunasundari prays Lord Shiva and Parvati regularly. The Lord is pleased with her devotion and bless her and her husband. He is relieved from the curse and becomes a beautiful prince again.
The king comes to know the whole truth. He calls back Gunasundari and her husband back to the kingdom and makes them King and Queen. Thus, Gunasundari stands tall above all others.[3]
