Take Me to Paris

Mr. Armstrong’s racing stable is preparing to send one of its top horses to run in Paris's Maisons Lafitte, when the thoroughbred is unexpectedly injured. Its replacement is Dunderhead, a much lowlier animal, but favourite of jockey and stable lad, Albert. Meanwhile, two crooked stable hands plot to use the cross channel trip to smuggle forged bank notes in the horse’s blanket. Their plans are foiled however, by Albert, who also manages to win the big race riding his favourite horse.
