Annan

Velan (Ramarajan) is the manager of the village market and is a respected man. He loves dearly his only sister Lakshmi (Apoorva) who is the village's school teacher. Sundari (Swathi) and her father (R. Sundarrajan) come to Velan's village. Velan and Sundari fall in love with each other whereas Lakshmi and the rural development officer Selvam (Vaasan) fall in love with each other. In the meantime, Velan and the village chief Rasappan (Manivannan) decide to arrange the marriage between Lakshmi and the wicked Rasappan's son Manikkam (Ponvannan). One day, Selvam breaks the village's rule and he is beaten at the village court. Lakshmi finally reveals the love between them and they get married. Selvam is not a rural development officer but a police officer who urges to arrest Velan. In the past, Velan killed a local rowdy who was in fact Selvam's father. Selvam arrests Velan and Velan is sent in jail. Manikkam becomes the new manager of the village market. Without sufficient evidences, the court releases Velan and he comes back to his village. Now, Velan has to face Selvam and Manikkam. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
