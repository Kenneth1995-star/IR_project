Newly married couple K. Krishnamurthy alias KK (Rajendra Prasad) works as an art director in Mumbai and his wife Satyabhama (Divyavani) as a stenographer in Kerala for a low salary. To solve their financial problems they seek a job in a big company and pretend to be unmarried as their boss Sridhar Rao (Gummadi) would give job only to one member of a family. So the couple lies that they are unmarried and joins in the company.
