Sanyasi

It is a story of a crook who is also a robber. He sets his eyes on a beautiful woman, Seetha who is Rajaram's wife. Rajaram seeks financial help from the crook to educate his son. The crook abducts Seetha but Seetha is saved by another woman. The rest of the story is how the problems are eventually solved.
A native doctor is of the firm belief that Indian medicine is the best. He wants to get a groom to the elder of his two daughters, Gunavathi and Gowri. He wants the groom to be a good native physician. He finds one, Kulapathi, who is also qualified in western medicine. The native doctor's brother-in-law claims his right to marry Gunavathi. So the native doctor sets a condition saying whoever who finds the old system of medicine called Muppu can marry his daughter. The B-I-L steals the document from the native doctor but the younger daughter Gowri takes it back. How the problem is solved forms the rest of the story.[4]
