Naan Yen Pirandhen

Kannan (MGR), a young man, lives with his wife (K.R. Vijaya) and kid. His mother (S.N. Lakshmi), sister (G. Sakunthala), her husband and children, also live with him as a joint family.
Kannan finds it difficult to make ends meet. So, he takes up a position with a rich businessman (Major Sundararajan), whose daughter (Kanchana), is confined to a wheelchair. She also develops health problems after the sudden death of her mother. Major Sundararajan hires Kannan as his manager, with the hope of marrying off his daughter to him, as he is under the impression that Kannan is a bachelor. Kannan also could not reveal the fact that he is a married man, but he gets the job. He lives in the house of the businessman and his daughter, and faces many problems.
Kannan reaches out to the rich man’s nephew Shankar (V. Gopalakrishnan), who is in America studying medicine, and informs him about the problems he is facing with the rich man’s daughter and requests him to come back soon. All the problems are solved soon, and the hero is reconciled with his wife and family. Shankar marries the rich girl who is now in good health, thanks to the attention and care bestowed upon her by Kannan. [2]
