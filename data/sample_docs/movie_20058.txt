The Virgin and the Gypsy

Based on a 1926 work by D.H. Lawrence, the film follows two sisters, Lucille and Yvette, who come to the English countryside for a vacation. Along the way, Yvette is interested in a gypsy who lives not far from her family's home. Slowly, Yvette becomes attracted to the gypsy, leading her to consider whether she wants to have a mundane life or a romance with someone her family may not accept.
