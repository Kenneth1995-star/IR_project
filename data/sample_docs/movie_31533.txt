Pakkinti Ammayi

Subbarayudu (Relangi) stays next to the house of Heroine Leela Devi (Anjali Devi). She madly likes dance and music very much. She appoints a music teacher Prem Kumar (Narayana Rao). She does not like the actions of Subbarayudu. But he likes her very much and even loves her. He takes the help of some friends and impresses that he knows music very well. She involves her teacher Prem Kumar against Subbarayudu. He takes the help of his friend (A.M.Rajah) and mimes as if singing good songs, while Rajah is singing from background. As a result, heroine almost likes him. But after knowing that he is not the singer, she changes her mind. Subbarayudu acts as a suicidal act for her refusal. Heroine finally changes her mind and loves him.
