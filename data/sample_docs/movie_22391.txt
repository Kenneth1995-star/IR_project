No Men Beyond This Point

The film is a science fiction mockumentary set in an alternate timeline where in the 1950s, human females began reproducing by parthenogenesis. Nine months after a near-Earth object almost hit Earth in 1952, the first fatherless baby is born. Sexual reproduction became rarer and rarer, and the babies born by way of parthenogenesis were all female, so that by the 2010s (when the mock documentary is filmed), the youngest male human on Earth is 37 years old; he is the ostensible subject of the mock documentary.[3][4]
