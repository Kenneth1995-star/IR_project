When Annie discovers a frightening organ-smuggling operation in her hospital, she is murdered. Dr. Roy is framed for the crime due to circumstantial evidence. However, on his way to jail, an accident occurs and he escapes. A fugitive from justice, he tries to discover the truth. He eventually finds aid in a police officer, Javed (Lalu Alex). Eventually, Dr. Roy is able to bring the perpetrators behind the kidney scam to justice and kill Ifti, (Sharat Saxena), his wife's murderer.
