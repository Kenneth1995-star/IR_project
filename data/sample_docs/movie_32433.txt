Don Seenu

This story is all about an ambitious boy named Seenu alias Srinivasa Rao (Ravi Teja) who dreams of becoming a don. He always likes to be called as ‘Don’ Seenu since childhood due to the strong influence of the Amitabh Bachchan starrer ‘Don’. He grows up with just one passion - that of becoming the World's No: 1 Don. Thanks to his enterprising nature, he gains access to the cream of the city's dons, and uses his cleverness to play off the top two - Madhapur Machiraju (Sayaji Shinde) and Narsingh (Srihari), fierce rivals - against each other. Seenu wants to join one of these dons and grow up in the ranks. He joins hands with Machiraju. In the process he is given a task to go to Germany and win the heart of Narsing’s sister whose marriage is fixed with the son of the super don Naveen Duggal (Mahesh Manjrekar). Seenu goes to Germany and wins the heart of Deepthi (Shriya Saran) and later, he discovers that he was shown the wrong girl. The wrong girl is none another than the sister of Machiraju. Then when Machiraju discovers that his henchman is the one who showed the wrong girl, Machiraju attempts to kill his henchman. This leads to various turns in the plot. What happens next is all about how Seenu achieves his dream of becoming a don and live happily with Deepthi or does he?
