En Thambi

The film is a tale of two step- brothers, Sivaji Ganesan born to Kannamba, and Balajee, born to Sundari Bai, who are fathered by a character played by Major Sundararajan. After the death of the father, the first son played by Sivaji, of exemplary character, takes care of the family wealth handed over to him. Balajee, a drunkard, addict and gambler, isnâ€™t too pleased about this, and always pesters his brother for money. So bothered is he that he eventually hatches a plan to kill him by drowning and pushes him from a boat. A passing theatre group, however, saves Sivaji from drowning. He later joins this group and becomes an actor. The younger son proclaims to the world that the elder son will never return. A nephew (Nagesh) learns about the actor that Sivaji has now become, and brings him back to the family. Nobody, however, believes that he is actually the missing son. After many twists, the villain gets exposed, the brothers unite, and Sivaji marries his beloved.
