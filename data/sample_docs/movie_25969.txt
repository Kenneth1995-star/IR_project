Yugpurush

Anirudh (Nana Patekar) is released from a facility that treats patients with mental ailments. Anirudh also happens to be an exceptional artist and does portraits of new people he meets. As he struggles with adjusting with the "normal" world, he encounters Sunita (Manisha Koirala), an escort and Ranjan (Jackie Shroff), the son of a renowned politician. Ranjan, is madly in love with Sunita, but Sunita does not feel the same way about him. Anirudh is the only person to see beyond Sunita's seemingly comfortable and affluent existence and knows that deep down she is extremely sad and alone. They develop a special bond of friendship despite their vastly different personalities and backgrounds. Anirudh also becomes good friends with Ranjan. Ranjan is a good-hearted but egotistical man who cannot bear even the thought of failure in any aspect of his life. Can he handle Sunita's rejection? Can he deal with the fact that Sunita feels closer to Anirudh than him? Will Sunita find happiness? And, most importantly, will Anirudh survive in this "sane" world?
