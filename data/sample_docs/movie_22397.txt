The Waiting Room

Jasmin, once a successful actor in former Yugoslavia, now lives in Toronto with his second wife and young son. While juggling a construction job and a busy audition schedule, he dreams of re-launching an old televised stage show that made him famous in his homeland. When he is cast in a role that triggers recollections of the civil war, he is forced to reconcile his current reality with memories of his past success. The idea behind this movie was rooted in the director's experiences in Toronto from performances by former Yugoslavians. This movie combines fiction with biographical elements in partially being inspired by the main character's lie in Toronto. The main character, Jasmin, was a successful actor in pre-war Sarajevo, which was part of a wildly popular televised stage show Audicija (The Audition). The director notes that he was very drawn to the idea of exploring the intersection between reality and fiction within the film because he wanted it to be a study of an immigrant performer, not a film that is about immigration. This movie focuses a great deal on the fiction portion of the film because the director did not want the movie to be a depiction of war during that time. This is because he did not want the movie to become a re-enactment of true events. The film sought to create a world whereby the story was inspired by true events during that time, but focused on the fictional portion in order for the film to not become a re-enactment during the time of war. http://www.timelapsepictures.ca/portfolio/cekaonica-the-waiting-room/ref name="undefined" />
