Pushpanjali

Dinesh Khanna (Sanjay Khan), discovers his son has brain cancer. The shock kills his wife, Lata (Faryal). Dinesh takes his son, Pappu (Shahid), and his faithful cook Maharaj (Manmohan Krishan) to an island, where they meet several characters who are after Rani Sahiba's (Lalita Pawar) diamond necklace. Dinesh and Pappu also get to know Menaka (Naina Sahu), who starts caring for Pappu. When Pappu has a seizure, a doctor is flown down to the island with the help of one of the kind-hearted crooked characters (Om Prakash). The doctor suggests an operation, but cannot give surety of Pappu surviving the ordeal. A dis-heartened Dinesh refuses the operation for Pappu and takes him to a temple. Pappu recovers miraculously and offers flowers (pushpanjali) at the idol of Shiva as a thanksgiving. Dinesh leaves the island with Pappu and Menaka.
