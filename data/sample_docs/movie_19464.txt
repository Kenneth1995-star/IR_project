No Trees in the Street

In the slums of London before World War II, Tommy is an aimless teenager who tries to escape his squalid surroundings by entering a life of crime. He falls in with local racketeer Herbert Lom, who holds the rest of the slum citizens in a grip of fear - including Tommy's own family. The film chronicles Tommy's sordid progression from minor thefts to murder.[3]
