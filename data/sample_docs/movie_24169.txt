Chotoder Chobi

After a horrific accident while performing a stunt for the circus, trapeze artist Shibu finds himself restricted to his bed. In compensation, the manager agrees to pay only â‚¹ 15,000 to Shibu's family, which according to Shibu's juniors is a minuscule amount. They are angry but helpless as the only source of regular income for them is the circus. Sympathizing with the struggle of Shibu and his family, Khoka (Dulal Sarkar), Shibu's closest friend, decides to protest against the manager and hence leaves his job and take on total responsibility for Shibu's family. The family struggles with social apathy towards dwarves and poverty then takes a turn when Khoka realizes that he is in love with Shibu's daughter, Soma (Debalina Roy).[2]
