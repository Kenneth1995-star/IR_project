Anuvahood

The story follows Kenneth (Adam Deacon) who likes to call himself "K". He has an ambition of becoming a grime MC, and has already created his debut mixtape, Feel The Pain. However, nobody has bought a single copy and Kenneth works, for now, at local supermarket Laimsbury's to help pay his family's rent. When his boss insults him at work for trying to be a rapper, he quits and his mother berates him for failing to pay the house rent and his family is soon threatened by bailiffs. Kenneth cannot take seeing his mother hassled by the bailiffs, so he begins to sell illegal drugs with his friends Bookie (Femi Oyeniran), Enrique (Ollie Barbieri), Lesoi (Michael Vu), and TJ (Jazzie Zonzolo). When local badman Tyrone (Richie Campbell) investigates Kenneth, he steals Kenneth's and his friends' accessories. His friends leave him and his family do not support him, so Kenneth slyly breaks into Tyrone's house to steal back his stuff. While Tyrone cheats on his baby's mother in the other room, Kenneth manages to steal everyone's stuff back, but Tyrone finds out and comes after him. Tyrone attacks him, and his friends try to help him, but Tyrone manages to scare them away, making it a one-on-one fight. Kenneth shockingly fights back and takes Tyrone down. After the humiliation, Tyrone's boss arrives and witnesses Tyrone hitting kids, therefore sacks him and insults him in front of the entire hood. To make matters worse Tyrone's baby's mother's brother appears on the scene to punish him further for cheating on his sister, and Tyrone flees in humiliation. Kenneth gets his job back at Laimsbury's and helps pay his family's rent.
