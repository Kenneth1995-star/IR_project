Mana Desam

The story is set in 1942. Ramnath is a respectable rich man living in a village with his wife Janaki, son Nehru, brother Madhu and a doting step-mother Yashoda, who does not like Madhu’s active participation in the freedom struggle, fearing that he may be jailed. Janaki’s uncle, a lawyer, visits them with his city-bred daughter Sobha. She takes a liking for Madhu but is against his political leanings.
Ramnath shifts his family to Madras. Madhu is arrested for participating in the movement against the British rule. A changed Sobha too jumps into the freedom struggle. Unable to trace her, the police take Ramnath into custody. An enraged Yashodha too joins the movement and goes to jail. But both are soon released. Madhu on parole comes home and Janaki treats him like her son. By then she is critically ill. Once the parole is over, the police come to pick him up. On seeing them, Janaki dies of shock. The police drag a deranged Madhu. After serving the sentence, Madhu, still in a mentally deranged condition, is released. Yashoda blames Ramnath for her son’s plight. A dejected Ramnath leaves the house with his son. But, worried about his brother, he returns home and saves him from a fall. In a dramatic way, Madhu regains normality. India gets independence and the family participates in the celebrations.
