The Belstone Fox

The Belstone Fox is the nickname given to Tag, a fox cub rescued from the woods and adopted by huntsman Asher. The young fox is reared in captivity with a litter of hound puppies, including Merlin, with whom Tag becomes especially friendly. Asher is devoted to Tag, who combines cool cunning and knowledge of human habitation to lead the pack and hunters in many a "merry chase". Asher, though now an outsider to the hunt club, is mildly amused and protective of the fox. However, when Tag leads the hunt into the path of a train and many hounds are killed, he determines to bring down the fox in the approved manner, rather than with a firearm, and dies in the attempt.
