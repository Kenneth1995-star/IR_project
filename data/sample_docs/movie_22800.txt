Chongqing Hot Pot

From director Yang Qing (One Night at the Supermarket) comes Chongqing Hot Pot, the official opening night film at the Hong Kong International Film Festival. When three friends open a hot pot restaurant in a former bomb shelter, they discover it’s linked by a single wall to the bank vault next door. While deciding to take the easy money or go to the police, they find out one of the bank’s employees is a former classmate and look to enlist her in deciding their future. The movie ended on a happy note with the four friends eating together loosely discussing their future on the roof of the hospital where Liu Bo is admitted.[5]
