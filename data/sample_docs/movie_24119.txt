Amar Bodyguard

Anol (Naziur Rahman) is a philanthropist who spends his time doing good deeds and helping out people. One day he comes across Ankhi, a spoilt urchin who thinks of money. From that moment they become inseparable and they always go together to all places. It seemed as if that Ankhi loved Anol, but actually, she didn't. On the other hand, Anol (Hamidur- the protagonist of the film) fell in love with her and later on, one day, Anol confessed his love for her. But, in reply, Ankhi said that she was just playing a game with him and that he was just like her bodyguard, whom she took everywhere with her for her own safety. However, Anol's love was able to change Ankhi's mindset. In the meantime, Ankhi's fiance, Jayanta (Arka) tries to kill Anol by employing goons and Anal is arrested on false charges. Afterwards, the charges were reversed when it was revealed that Jayanta was the culprit. The film ends as Jayanta is arrested and Ankhi goes back to Anol. Ankhi is helped by Anol who helps her get over her mistakes.[2]
