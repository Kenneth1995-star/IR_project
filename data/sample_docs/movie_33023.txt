6 Ultra Brothers !The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army

A young boy is protecting a Hindu temple in Thailand when robbers arrive, stealing goods and shoot him in the face. The Mother of Ultra fuses him with the Monkey-god Hanuman. The Ultra Brothers, Zoffy, Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Ultraman Jack, Ultraman Ace and Ultraman Taro, team up with Hanuman to fight five evil monsters. They are Gomora (from Ultraman), Dustpan (originally from Mirrorman), Astromons, Tyrant and Dorobon (all from Ultraman Taro), which were accidentally awakened by a rocket test gone terribly wrong. Eventually, the seven heroes triumph over the monsters, and all return home.
