Sainik

This movie is about an army officer named Suraj Dutt (Akshay Kumar), who is the son of Yashpal Dutt (Anupam Kher). Suraj goes to meet his sister Minnie in at a women's college before he falls in love with Alka (Ashwini Bhave). They get married soon, but Suraj is called for a year-long mission. While he is away a message arrives that Suraj has been killed. Minni, Alka and Yashpal each learn about this, but don't tell each other as they feel each other will die upon hearing this. Meanwhile, Minni is about to wed Vijay (Ronit Roy), but on the day of her wedding, she is kidnapped. The movie ends, surprising everyone with the reappearance of Suraj, (who was alive all this while!) who comes and saves Mini, and everybody is reunited.
