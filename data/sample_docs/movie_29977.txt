Kalimuthu (Ramarajan) is the lead singer of a group performing Villu Paatu. The village head (Shanmugasundaram) decides to reconstruct the tumbledown village temple and gives Kalimuthu responsibility for funding money. Finally, the music director Ilaiyaraaja helps them financially. Then, Kalimuthu approaches a reputed sculptor (M. N. Nambiar) from another village. The sculptor and his daughter Abhirami (Rani) come to their village. Later, Kalimuthu and Abhirami fall in love with each other. Abhirami's father wants to marry Abhirami to his nephew Rajasekharan (Chandrasekhar) while the village head's son Chelladurai (Vikas Rishi), a womanizer, has an eye for Abhirami. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
