The story is about Prakash (Jayasurya) whose father, Sreedhara Kurup, runs a supermarket. Prakash’s father wants him to become an officer but Prakash’s interests lie elsewhere. After graduation, he is more interested in the activities of the village arts club than in looking for a job. He falls for a village girl, Uthara (Roma). But her rich father, Mahadevan, arranges her marriage with another rich boy. The story builds up from here on.
Lots of twists and turns later, Prakashan marries his dream-girl, but their marriage doesn't last even for a day. This causes serious drifts in both families, and Prakashan's mother dies suddenly with a broken heart. But, after some days, Uthara's family comes to visit him, and asks to forgive him for breaking the marriage, after which Uthara went to depression. Finally, all ends well, with Uthara's disease getting cured and starting a new life.
