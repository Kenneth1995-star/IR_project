Kal Aaj Aur Kal

The title is an allegory to the ideological clash between three generations: Kal (Grandparent), Aaj (Parent) and Kal(Youth). Diwan Bahadur Kapoor (Prithviraj Kapoor) is the father of Ram Bahadur Kapoor (Raj Kapoor). Ram's son Rajesh (Randhir Kapoor), who had been sent to London for higher studies, returns to India. Bahadur has promised his childhood friend that Rajesh's marriage will be done with the latter's granddaughter.
However, Rajesh is in love with his girlfriend Monica (Babita) and objects to the marriage. Both the grandfather and the grandson stick to their guns, little realizing that Ram is the real sufferer in the clash. Ram leaves his home, leaving the grandfather grandson duo blaming each other. Now, it is up to Ram to take the matter into his hands.
