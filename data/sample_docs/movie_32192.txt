Donga Dongadi

Vasu (Manoj Manchu) is a strong willed reckless guy. He spends most of his time hanging out with his friends, who belong to the same flock. He loves his father (Manikka Vinayagam) and his brother (Rajiv Kanakala) very dearly. His brother is different from him that he is responsible and studious. He ignores his father's words of wisdom and is regularly chided by his father as a good-for-nothing guy. In one such incident he loses the trust and faith of his father as he gets involved in teasing a girl called Vijji (Sadha). That incident makes Vasu realize the importance of having good relationship with his father, but his father asks him to prove himself as a responsible man. Vasu travels to Vizag from Tirupati in search of a job. In Vizag, he incidentally meets Vijji again. Meanwhile, there is another girl Pooja (Varshita), who is madly in love with Vasu. With Vasu out to prove a point to his father, finally convinces him and in the process also wins the hand of the heroine. By the end, he also realizes the importance of family values and his love for Vijji.
