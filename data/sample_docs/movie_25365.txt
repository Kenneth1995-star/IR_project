Mahaguru

Naag Raj Darbari (Shafi Inamdar) and his associate Shyam Kumar Talwari (Shafi Inamdar) rule over a small community in India with an iron hand. When former military officer, Subhash (Rakesh Roshan), comes home to his mother and sister, he is appalled at the conditions that the community is living in, and decides to do everything possible to improve their lot. This gets him in the bad books of Darbari (Kader Khan) and Talwari (Shubha Khote), who recruit a hit-man named Mahaguru (Rajinikanth) to deal with Subhash. Mahaguru confronts Subhash, and severely beats him up, resulting in Subhash being crippled for life. Shortly thereafter, Mahaguru rescues Subhash's sister (Nirupa Roy) from some men who were molesting her. Village belle Basanti (Meenakshi Sheshadri), a close friend of Subhash, decides to have a go at turning Mahaguru around. She starts a friendship with him, finds out his name is really Vijay, and he does respond positively and becomes attracted to her. This leaves Subhash free to assist the community, thus angering Darbari and Talwari all the more. They abduct Subhash and hold him prisoner, and then instruct Mahaguru to do away with him. Will Basanti's influence change Mahaguru? Or will he just act for anyone who gives him money?
