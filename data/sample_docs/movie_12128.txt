Another Midnight Run

Jack Walsh (McDonald) is hired by bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Dan Hedaya) to bring in Bernie Abbot (Jeffrey Tambor) and Helen Bishop (Cathy Moriarty), a husband and wife team of con artists. Moscone also brings in rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler (Ed O'Ross) to work with Jack, with the agreement that they will split the money; however, both men are planning to double cross each other.
