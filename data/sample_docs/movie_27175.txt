Katte (Shankar Nag) and Prabhakar Rao / Tatha (Loknath) are petty thieves who can't seem to get a break in life. Their criminal past does not leave them wherever they go. To make it big, they resort to their past and start jumping unsuspecting passers by on National Highways and relieving them of their automobiles. Disassembling the auto parts, they sell them for money and often duping people on their way.
Soon their jig is up when one of their stolen vehicles breaks down and a mechanic Anthony "Tony" D'Souza (Anant Nag) is brought for help. Seeing that money is a free flowing concept in this criminal life, Tony joins hands with this crime duo. Soon the trio is hitting various spots and making away with vehicles. During this process, they even manage to rope in another petty thief Manju (Priya Tendulkar), who is thieving to meet her sick mother's medical bills, into their criminal enterprise. Soon, Tony and Manju get married.
The cops are hot on their trail for a good part of the film before finally clamping the trio down much to the delight of the pipe-smoking Inspector Nayak (Ramesh Bhat). As jailbirds, Katte and Thatha seem to have found their peace but not Tony. His desperate self is trying to get away from the chains that bind him. A prison break is planned and executed to almost perfection by the three. In the process, Tatha dies after accidentally falling off the high prison walls. Katte and Tony are killed in an encounter while trying to flee from the cops. The film ends with Manju, who at this stage is pregnant by Tony, vowing to raise the child in a good and healthy environment.
