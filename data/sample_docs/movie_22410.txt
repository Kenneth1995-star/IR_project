Nelly

Isabelle Fortier is a young girl who develops a relationship and becomes engaged to a man, with whom she shares a cocaine habit. Their relationship deteriorates. Taking the pseudonym Cynthia, Isabelle becomes a prostitute. She receives rave online customer reviews, from clients who praise her for her physical features, service and aptitude in various sex acts. She begins to write about her experiences, submitting her first novel under the pen name Nelly Arcan to an editorial committee, who regard it with a combination of shock and interest. The publisher Mathieu travels to Montreal to meet her, inquiring if the stories contained in the novel are autobiographical. Initially questioning the importance of the novel's truthfulness, Nelly replies the stories are a combination of reality and invention. She also lies and says she is 26, as she had always wished to be published before turning 30.
The novel exceeds the bestseller benchmark of 5,000 sales, with 30,000 copies sold in Quebec and France. Nelly receives critical acclaim and is nominated for prestigious European literary awards. At the same time, she is conflicted about the exposure, feeling as if she lost something with the publication of the novel. Her adoring public is intrigued and eager to learn more about whether the stories she tells are true, while she becomes panicked that her next book may not sell or may be a critical failure. One reader inquires about an episode in her work where a prostitute jumps from a building to escape a violent client, which Nelly had extracted from a dream, and questions her about her later books falling in sales.
In confession, Nelly speaks of how everything in her life seems to be killing her, and questions if Nelly Arcan or Isabelle Fortier is the real mask. She finally commits suicide after three books have been published, with a fourth published posthumously.
