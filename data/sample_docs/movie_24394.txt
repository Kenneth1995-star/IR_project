Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu

Born under a Neem tree and hence also called Nimai, Vishvambar (Bharat Bhushan) is the tenth son of Jagannath Mishra and his wife Sachi Devi. Due to his fair colour, he is often referred to as Gaurang (Fair-coloured). The social milieu in the 15th century setting of the story is shown as being dismal, with hypocritical priests and oppressive rulers. He loses his father at an early age and the family faces hardships financially. Nimai completes his education and is an expert at debating with the local priests. He starts a school and marries Vishnupriya, daughter of Sanatan Misra who is the court priest. On his father's death anniversary he goes to Gaya to perform prayers for his father. There, he meets a saint called Ishvara Puri. He soon develops complete devotion to Krishna and starts chanting and singing his praises. His Radha and Krishna Bhakti (devotion) songs attract people from all walks of life. He takes renunciation and shaves his head. He settles in Puri, concentrating on his Bhakti and disappears while singing a bhajan. Dhananjay Bhattacharya sang in a wonderful and rich voice "Hari Hari Bol, Mukund Madhav Govind Bol".
