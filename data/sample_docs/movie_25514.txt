Bahurani

Amit (Rakesh Roshan) is a modern guy, raised in Bombay (present day Mumbai) and educated in USA. He wants to marry a compatible woman who is educated like him and shares his views. To the contrary, his parents fix his marriage with a beautiful, intelligent and traditional village girl, Madhuri (Rekha). Amit tries to reject but his father (Utpal Dutt) adamantly demands that he should marry Madhuri or leave the house. Having no choice, Amit waits for an opportunity.
Madhuri lives along with her widowed mother and her brother Shrikant (Rakesh Bedi). Shrikant comes to Amit's house before marriage and Amit's father demands dowry in the form of gold just to make fun of him. He takes that seriously and thinking that the wedding will not take place if he can't get the gold, gets fake jewellery. During the wedding ceremony, Amit observes that and takes that opportunity to reject the bride despite the fact that the wedding has already taken place and Madhuri is his wife now. Amit's parents request Madhuri to wait for some time for Amit to correct his behavior.
But after a year, still Amit wouldn't come back to take Madhuri to her in-laws house. Madhuri wants to get a job in Bombay and goes to an interview. There, she comes to know that Amit is the boss and gets the job anyway. She changes her name to Malathi Choudhury and as Amit hasn't seen her face previously, dosen't recognize her. He develops feelings for Malathi and after some time she reciprocates them too. He wants to marry her, hiding the fact that he is a married man.
Amit's parents still waiting for Madhuri, come to know about Malathi and try to confront her. They recognize Madhuri and want to continue the game. At last, Madhuri's mother reveals Malathi's real identity to Amit and he plays a little drama too. At last, Amit asks for forgiveness and invites Madhuri as daughter-in-law (Bahurani) to his house.
