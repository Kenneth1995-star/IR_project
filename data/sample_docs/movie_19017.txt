The Frightened Man

Junk dealer Roselli's dreams for his son Julius are disappointed when the young man is sent down from Oxford University after poor grades. Julius then gets involved with a gang of Camden Town jewel thieves for whom his father is the fence. When they attempt to rob a warehouse, Julius is injured in the getaway but continues his involvement. The gang next plan a raid on a jeweller’s in Hatton Garden, but intend to cut out Roselli. The old man tips off the police – unaware that his son is a member of the gang.[2][3]
