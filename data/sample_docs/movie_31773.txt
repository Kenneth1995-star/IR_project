Devadasu Malli Puttadu

The film is based on the concept of Reincarnation an idea chiseled in the mind of director Dasari Narayana Rao to give completeness to Devadasu's story. The film begins Devadasu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) leaving his last breath in front of Parvathi's (Savitri) house and she rushes to see him, but the door is closed by her family and she collapses. Chandramukhi is a courtesan who falls in love with Devadasu, whom he promises to marry in next life also dies at his Samadhi. Now the story begins Devadasu takes rebirth as Sridhar Raja, Chandramukhi as Aruna (Vanisri) and Parvathi is still waiting for Devadasu because she has a desire from her childhood to serve Devadasu and she has strong faith that he will definitely come to keep up his promise. Rest of the story is whether Devadasu comes back and how he reunites with Chandramukhi.
