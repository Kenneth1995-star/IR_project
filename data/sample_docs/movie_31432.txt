Yaman

As the film begins, Devarakonda Gandhi (Vijay Antony) is killed by his rivals who fear that their position would be threatened if he were to make it big in politics. Decades later, his son Ashok Chakravarthy (Vijay Antony, again) accidentallyis drawn into the murky world of behind-the-screens politicking when he is jailed due to admitting to have hit someone on the road.
Two gangster-type baddies with political backing become his enemies and this in turn brings him closer to Karunakaran (Thyagarajan), a political heavyweight who has his own ambitions. A minister sees Ashok as an enemy because he sees in him his father Gandhi, whom he had conspired to murder.
Machinations and counter-machinations grow with the growing political ambitions of Ashok, whose rivals won't let him and his friend (Miya George as actress Anjana) live in peace.
Ashok boldly faces all this in his game of one-upmanship and realizes his dream of growing big in politics.
