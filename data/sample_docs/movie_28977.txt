Pizhaikkum Vazhi

The hero (played by T. S. Durairaj) is an idler. He thinks it is easy to earn a living by cheating innocent and unsuspecting people. There is a fake 'swami' (holy man) and the hero becomes a fake disciple of the 'swami'. He makes cheating the formula of his living. How he does it and what comes to him form the story.[1]
