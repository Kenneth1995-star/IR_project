The Devil's Mate

As murderer Maloney is being executed in the electric chair, he's willing to expose an underworld mob boss. He is killed by a poison dart before he can tell anything. Inspector O'Brien suspects McGhee, a ward healer and friend of Maloney; Parkhurst, a scholar, philanthropist, and candidate for the prison board; Clinton, a friend of Parkhurst; or Natural, a reporter for the "Chronicle" newspaper. Since McGhee is a nonsmoker and found in possession of a empty cigarette case, he is arrested.
