Sohni Mahiwal

Shahzada Izzat Beg comes to India with his caravan and settles in a town in Punjab. Here he falls in love with Sohni, who keeps a shop in metal pots. Izzat Beg buys a pot from her with whatever money he had and they were attracted to each other. Sohni dispensed with her servant and kept Izzat Beg instead. This gave them more opportunity to meet. This was a scandal in the town and Sohni was perforce married to Rehman, who was slightly off his head. Sohni continued meeting Izzat Beg, who went out fishing. When the atmosphere became too hot for them they jointly took a watery grave for their love.
