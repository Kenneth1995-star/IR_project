Sanam Teri Kasam

Vijay Verma (Saif Ali Khan) is a rich and selfish playboy who enjoys playing with women by giving a fake name to every girl. His friend, Gopal, (Atul Agnihotri) tells him several times to stop this act otherwise he will regret it. One day, Vijay meets a lovely tourist, Seema (Pooja Bhatt) and falls in love with her after a few meetings. During a separation, Seema sends Vijay a letter about her father agreeing to marriage with Vijay. He replies saying that he will leave immediately to get to her place. This is when the narrative introduces a shocking heel turn. Seema's father arrives at the airport and is greeted by his future son-in-law, and, shortly after, Seema's marriage ceremony takes place. After the marriage, Seema finds out that the person who has married her is none other than Gopal and she was tricked into marriage with him; when he knew that Vijay loved her too. Seema and her unexpected new spouse turn up at Vijay's home, and it's frustrating then to see Vijay quietly take the abuse doled out by the two-faced husband. Lots of yearning glances exchanged between Vijay and Seema, lots of smirking by the husband. It's a revenge tale, of course. There's a reason Seema got tricked into wedlock.
