Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin

An advertising executive, Aditya (Nirmal Pandey) has a beautiful wife (Tara Deshpande) and a beautiful mistress (Smriti Mishra). This secret affair is the catalyst for much of the plot. Adi gets into a scuffle with a bunch of gangsters led by Ramanbhai, (Ashish Vidyarthi). To add to the tension, Ramanbhai is under duress because his colleague, Vilas Pandey (Saurabh Shukla) is after his life.
A small-scale gang war erupts in the city: A cop Inspector Patankar (Ganesh Yadav) is changing sides faster than a chameleon, a rival gang lord Prafulla Kalia (Virendra Saxena) is offering deals and — in the middle of all this — Aditya finds himself stuck. A fast-paced sequence of events happen in the span of one single night.
