Lost Song

After their first-born baby, Pierre (Patrick Goyette) and Élisabeth (Suzie LeBlanc) drive to the country to stay with his mother. The baby is restless, refusing to eat and having trouble sleeping. Élisabeth perplexed with what to do leaves the baby with her overly attentive mother-in-law Louise (Ginette Morin), spending time with teenaged neighbor Naomi (Marilou Longpré Pilon), and finding comfort in the girl’s friendship.
