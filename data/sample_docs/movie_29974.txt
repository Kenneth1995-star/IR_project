The story begins with a group of government officers who come to list the number of devastated houses. The officers promised them to give a big amount to build their house but in exchange for a little amount to register their name. So the illiterate villagers, who wants to make easy money, demolish their house. The officers turn out to be frauds. The village panchayat president (Vinu Chakravarthy) knows that the villagers will not interfere in his decision until they are uneducated. Sivaraman, a new school teacher, tries to change their custom and the children are happy to learn at school. Soon, Sivaraman has trouble with the village head.
