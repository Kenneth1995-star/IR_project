Sundaravadivelu (Vijayan) is a wealthy school manager and a landlord who is a hedonist and a sadist. He finds pleasure in torturing people emotionally including his own family members. He also siphons the school's money for his own needs. His wife Lakshmi (Ashwini) is a goodhearted homely wife, and he has two children. Sundaravadivelu never respects his wife's feelings. He is an irresponsible husband and a father. Lakshmi's father (Charuhasan) is indebted to Sundaravadivelu as he had borrowed money from him. Using this as a trump card, Sundaravadivelu proposes Lakshmi's sister Shenbagam(Madhu Malini). But Shenbagam and her father do not approve this. Sundaravadivelu is infuriated and forces out Lakshmi from his house falsely accusing her of having an affair with the health inspector of the village (Sarath Babu). Lakshmi, who is seriously ill, passes away soon. Sundaravadivelu marries again, and his second wife shows no love or care towards him as well as his kids. Meanwhile, Shenbagam develops a liking towards a school teacher working at Sundaravadivelu's school. The school's management gets to know about Sundavadivelu's mismanagement and they decide to take action on him. The marriage of Shenbagam with her lover is set, and on the previous day, Shenbagam goes to Sundaravadivelu's house, requesting him to send his kids with her, so that she can take care of them. But Sundaravadivelu molests her which is seen by his second wife. His wife ditches him and goes her way. The villagers are provoked and maddened now. They corner Sundaravadivelu and ask him to choose his way of death, and finish his life. Sundaravadivelu commits suicide, and in his last moments, he realises that he was always a sadist. Moments before his death he shares a tender moment with his kids.
