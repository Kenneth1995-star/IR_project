Saajan Chale Sasural

Shyamsunder (Govinda) is a naive villager who has a great interest in music. He travels to the city, making friends with Muthuswami (Satish Kaushik), a South Indian tabla player. The president of the TIPS cassette company, Khurana (Kader Khan), is impressed with his musical abilities and promotes him to a high position. As he goes back to repay his debts in the village, he receives tragic news of the death of his wife Pooja (Karisma Kapoor), who has died in a flood. He then marries Khurana's daughter Divya (Tabu). When Khurana has a heart attack, Shyamsunder finds his "presumed dead" wife Pooja in the hospital. He then has to fool his two wives, even if it includes leading a double life to make sure Pooja and Divya don't discover he has married both of them.
