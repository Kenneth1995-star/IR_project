Kartoos

A cop ACP Jay Suryavanshi (Jackie Shroff) trains a criminal Raja (Sanjay Dutt) to eliminate underworld don Jagat Jogia (Gulshan Grover).[2] Jay performs a surgery and implants a transmitter in Raja's leg when he meets with an accident. So whenever Raja travels, Jay can track his movements (even when he is in the UK). Raja falls in love with Mini (Manisha Koirala), even though he was not 'allowed' to fall in love by Jay. Raja kills Jagat Jogia and his gang and is finally set free by Jay and lives with Mini happily.
