When the Lights Went Out

In 1974, Jenny and Len move into a new home in Yorkshire where their 13-year-old daughter Sally is haunted by the ghost of a young girl, and the demonic ghost of a monk. Sally's parents seek out the assistance of a paranormal specialist and a local priest, who performs an exorcism that does not succeed in ending the hauntings.
