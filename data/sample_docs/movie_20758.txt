Nora

Dublin, 1904. Walking down Dublin's Nassau Street, James Joyce meets Nora Barnacle, a young and attractive woman from Galway. Joyce, immediately in love with the young woman, offers to 'show her the city'. Nora coldly states that she has to work.
The film then proceeds to examine the relationship between Joyce and Barnacle.
