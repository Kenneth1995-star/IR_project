Ivan Tsarevich and the Gray Wolf 3

In a faraway kingdom, the tsar turns 150 years old and decides that it is time to rest from state affairs and so he retires and sets off towards the country wilderness. Tsar Ivan Tsarevich and his friend Gray Wolf are left to guard the kingdom. Vasilisa resents her husband because he has not organized a wedding trip abroad for her. The couple, together with the Scholar Cat and the Gray Wolf, sit down on the magic flying carpet and set out on a journey. They leave an ordinary scarecrow behind them, which through Ivan's fault comes to life due to the delayed curse which he has lifted and begins to establish its own rules in the kingdom. On the place where the scarecrow stood a source of hypnotic crimson jam mysteriously appears, and the faraway kingdom begins to transform in fundamental ways.
