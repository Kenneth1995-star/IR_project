Venu (Venu Thottempudi) is a receptionist at a lowly beachside hotel in Vizag. He has a beautiful neighbor Nirmala (Ashima Bhalla). Her father's (Mouli) financial status is in bad shape and Venu helps them monetarily and morally. In the process Nirmala falls in love with Venu and Nirmala's family approves their relationship. Later on a well-off guy, Ramji, starts helping Nirmala and family out with luxurious items and better living conditions. Nirmala's father falling for this windfall, forces Nirmala to accept Ramji's marriage proposal by dumping Venu.
Later, Venu meets another girl Radha (Abhirami) who starts having feelings for him and she also monetarily helps him out. Venu is also aware of this. By then, Nirmala gets cheated and dumped by Ramji. Venu inspires her again to achieve her goals and sells off all his property to pay as a donation in a private college for her medical seat. When Nirmala becomes a doctor, she proposes to Venu. The climax of the film is that Venu rejects Nirmala and chooses Radha as his life partner, as Radha's Love had purity, which lacked in Nirmala's Love in the Past.
