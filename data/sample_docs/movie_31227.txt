Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum

The film starts off on a tragic note and travels back and forth to then and now. Gautam (Shivaji Dev), a young man in his late twenties, and his fiancée in the U.S., Ramya (Shilpa Bhatt), exchange endearments at midnight little aware of the disaster that is to strike in a few hours. The next morning, he finds out that she has met with an accident and succumbed to her injuries. It isn’t easy for Gautam to come out of the trauma that hits him hard.
