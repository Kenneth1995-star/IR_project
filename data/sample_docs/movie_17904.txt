Fat Pizza vs. Housos

After serving 15 years in jail for assaulting a health inspector with a chainsaw, pizza chef Bobo Gigliotti is released. Upon his release, he and his Mama attempt to reopen Fat Pizza, their former business in the fictional Sydney suburb of Hashfield. They soon find that due to rent increases since the time they were last in business, the only place that they can afford to reopen their pizzeria is in the infamous housing commission suburb of Sunnyvale. Employing many of their previous workers including Sleek the Elite, as well as a few locals, their re-establishment in Sunnyvale results in conflict with the local Housos, notably Shazza Jones, Franky Falzoni and Kev the Kiwi.[3][6][7]
The movie briefly includes references to Fenech's two other television series, with Franky Falzoni stealing a van belonging to Swift and Shift Couriers early in the film and a segment from Bogan Hunters being shown on TV in a scene where Franky is watching television.
The film features a "thongarang", which is a boomerang made of two bolted-together thongs.[8][9]
