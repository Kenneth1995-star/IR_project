The Phobos

On a rainy summer day a group of young people go to a club called "Phobos", which is under construction and in the past used to be a bomb shelter. Suddenly all the club doors are automatically closed and the lights are switched off. Initially the characters perceive everything as a joke but later realize that they are trapped: their cell phones do not work and they did not tell anyone about their intention to go to this club. The goth girl Vika says that there is a creature that feeds on their fears and that they need to overcome their own feelings of fright.
