Tell It to a Star

Carol Lambert is a cigarette girl in a posh Florida hotel. A note is delivered to the resort's bandleader, Gene Ritchie, requesting that Carol get a chance to sing. Gene already has a singer, Mona St. Clair, so the note causes resentment and Carol is fired.
Mrs. Whitmore, the hotel's owner, likes Carol and rehires her. Meantime, a con artist who calls himself "Colonel" Morgan turns up and, with partner Billy, begins scamming the hotel's guests. An embarrassed Carol tries to cover for him.
Morgan uses his charms to persuade Mrs. Whitmore to let Carol sing. She's a great success, but when an irate Mona reveals that Morgan's a con man who has even promised to deliver a new benefactor for the band, the musicians walk out. Carol arranges an all-girl band for Gene and it's a hit. She and Gene hit it off, too.
