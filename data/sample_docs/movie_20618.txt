A Month by the Lake

In 1913, spinster Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave) enjoyed spending her summer holiday in Lake Como, Italy, with her father before World War I. The year is now 1937, and her father has recently died. To clear the air, she returns to Lake Como on her own to spend a month's summer holiday.
She meets a bachelor named Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox) and becomes interested in him. But a young American girl named Miss Beaumont (Uma Thurman) arrives and flirts with the major.
