Chanti (Ravi Teja) respects his uncle Rama Krishna (Ghattamaneni Sivarama Krishna) more than his father Purshrotam (Chandra Mohan). Rama Krishna has enmity with Umapathi (Pradeep Rawat) because of something that happened 20 years ago. Later, Chanti is kicked out of their house because of some misunderstandings and now Umapathi is ready to put Rama Krishna down. How Chanti secretly helps Rama Krishna in bringing the enemy down and reunites with his family forms the rest of the story.
