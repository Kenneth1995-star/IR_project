Matinee

The plot of this film revolves around two people who come from different backgrounds but are united by fate. Najeeb (Maqbool Salmaan) is a youngster from an orthodox background who wishes to be a film star while Savithri (Mythili) is a motherless girl from an economically backward family who lands up in the film industry to escape her abusive father (Sasi Kalinga). The duo get a chance to be the lead pair in a film that appears to be an ordinary love story but turns out to be a sleaze-fest when it releases. The pair, subsequently, is ostracised from society.
