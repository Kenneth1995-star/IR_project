Spivs

Jack, Steve and Goat are East End London "spivs" (British slang for a black marketeer) who spend their days wheeling and dealing whenever and wherever they can. But not until they are landed with the juicy payoff they have been waiting for, involving a shady character who calls himself Villa, do they realize the trouble they have got into. After opening a truck door they discover they were not smuggling merchandise, rather they were smuggling people. The people run out of the cargo area. Jack is mad at Steve for not checking. Then suddenly they discover two small Albanian children a girl and a boy. Now they are in even more trouble.
