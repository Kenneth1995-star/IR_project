Green Slime !The Green Slime

A group of astronauts set out to blow up the asteroid Flora, which is now on a rapid collision course with the Earth. They land on the asteroid, plant explosive charges, and destroy it, barely escaping being destroyed by the explosion's massive shockwave. Afterwards, they return to the mission's staging area, space station Gamma 3, in high Earth orbit. Unfortunately, a scientist from the mission has unwittingly carried back a luminous-green substance on the leg of his spacesuit, which quickly mutates into one-eyed, tentacled monsters with the ability to discharge lethal bolts of electricity.
The Gamma 3 crew fend off the alien creatures with their laser-based weaponry, only to discover the creatures feed off the laser energy which, in turn, allows them to multiply rapidly, sprouting even more one-eyed creatures from their own blood. As the creatures overrun the station, the crew continues to fight back against overwhelming odds. The proceedings are further complicated by a love triangle consisting of two commanders and a female doctor.
