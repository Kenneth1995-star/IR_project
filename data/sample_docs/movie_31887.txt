Mohan (Rajendra Prasad), pledge never to give nor receive dowry in protest against dowry system. And he acts against his mother's wishes, Mohan marries Uma (Aswini) without asking for any dowry. He arranges his sister, Seeta's (Tara) marriage with Ravi (Raja), the son of Parameswara Rao (Gollapudi Maruthi Rao) and Savitri (P. R. Varalakshmi).
Parameswara Rao is a Municipal Commissioner and is a very greedy man. As he does not get any dowry, he and his wife become quite upset, though Ravi is happy. Both want Ravi to re-marry so that they can get dowry. Meanwhile, Seeta becomes pregnant and so the in-laws try to eliminate her at the earliest. Parameswara Rao gets Ravi transferred to another city. After sending him away, Parameswara Rao plans to kill Seeta in a fashion similar to an accident. But things did not turn up as he expected and his wife gets badly burned, who has to be hospitalised. Taking this opportunity, Parameswara Rao blames Seeta for attempting to kill Savitri and has her arrested. Finally, Mohan gives the dowry by taking debt to Parameswara Rao and beats him very badly, when Ravi leaves the house making a cut with his father which makes him remorseful after seeing all this and asks for Seeta's forgiveness. Seeta who has just given birth to a baby boy forgives him. Parameswara Rao return backs dowry to Mohan and he too pledges that no one would take nor receive any dowry henceforth in his family.
