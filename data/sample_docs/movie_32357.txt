Ankit, Pallavi & Friends

Ankit (Nikhil) is a carefree youngster who likes to live on his terms. He aspires to become a renowned musician. His parents support him. Pallavi (Megha Burman) is an exact opposite of Ankit. While Ankit believes in living life to the fullest, without a care in the world, Pallavi is seen working hard all the time. She is a software engineer in a big multinational.
The two are childhood friends and they have three other common friends. One wants to go to the US at any cost and is all the time making trips to the US consulate for a visa. The other wants to do social service. The third dreams of starting his own business but does not know what business to enter.
Over a period of time, Ankit and Palavi fall in love. But Pallavi does not like the carefree attitude of Ankit and his casual approach to life. She chides him for this and tells him that unless he takes his life seriously, she will leave him. They part ways at the interval bang.
As luck would have it, Ankit manages to land an offer to compose the music for a programme being conducted by UNICEF for an orphanage. His friend manages to land a job at the same orphanage. The orphanage is run by Sita.
Ankit becomes a big star after the success of his musical show. He is now a celebrity. Pallavi still longs to be with Ankit but is afraid to meet him as she thinks that Ankit will misunderstand her for coming to him only after seeing his success. Ankit also misses Pallavi very badly. The friends then plan a party and invite both Ankit and Pallavi, with the hope of bringing them together and become successful.
The film argues that happiness is a choice and that it is right around us only if we choose to pick it. It opened to good reviews.
