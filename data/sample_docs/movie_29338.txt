Naanal (1965 film)

The story is about four jailbirds escaping the prison to take revenge on the judge who sentenced them. They take over his house, and the movie builds around the judge and his family escaping from them. Although the movie has a supporting cast that shines throughout (Sowcar Janaki, Sreekanth, K. R. Vijaya, R. Muthuraman and of course Nagesh), it is brilliant because of Sudararajan (who plays the leader of the rat pack) and V. S. Raghavan (who plays the Judge).
