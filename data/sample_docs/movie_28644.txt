Thrissivaperoor Kliptham

David 'Davy' Pauly (Chemban Vinod) hails from Thrissur. His marriage with a lady (Sneha Sreekumar), arranged by his brother Sevasinos (Abi), is unsuccessful, after a bottle of alcohol he hid breaks in the church. Davy's aunt speculates that Joy Chembadan (Baburaj), Davy's classmate in school and now arch-nemesis, was behind this.
Girija 'Giri' Vallabhan (Asif Ali) is from Pattikad and is a very naive person. He is friends with Ambiyettan (Nandhu), an emigrant from another part of Kerala, who introduces him to Davy and his gang, consisting of Bahuleyan (Irshad), Philip Kannadakkaran (Rony David) and Alahu (Achuthanandhan), after a spectacular fight in the market.
