Captain

Kannappa Rao / Kannayiram in Tamil Version (Raghuvaran), a powerful mafia lord, and his sons Vijaya (Rocky) and Jaya (Devan) spread terror around the Chennai (Vishakhapatnam in Telugu version) town. They are known for grabbing lands. One day, Vijaya and Jaya threaten Ramasamy (Sarath Babu) to give his land in which there is an orphanage, but Ramasamy refuses categorically. Ramasamy is brutally killed in front of Gowri (Ranjitha). The information reaches his brother Shiva (R. Sarathkumar), who is a short-tempered soldier. His superiors reject his request to leave the military camp, so Shiva flees the camp. In the past, Shiva was in love with Uma (Sukanya), but she died in a plane crash. Later, Shiva complains against Kannayiram and he hires lawyer Lakshmi Narayanan (Janagaraj). Lakshmi Narayanan's daughter Gowri, who is dumb, becomes the eyewitness of the case. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
