Tell Me O Kkhuda

The film is about a girl named Tanya (Esha Deol) who learns that she was adopted by Colonel Ravi Kapoor and his wife when he rescued her from a burning hospital. This leads Tanya to go on a journey in search of her biological parents. She travels across the globe to find them. The first man she visits is a ruler of a patriarchal district in Rajasthan where female infanticide is common (played by Vinod Khanna) named Abhay Rana Pratap Singh. However, it is revealed that Manjuri (Abhay Singh's niece) is his actual daughter since her nanny had hidden the truth from everyone. Even Rana Pratap hadn't known that his wife had given birth to a baby girl before dying in a fire.
Tanya then travels to Turkey to meet Altaf Zardari (played by Rishi Kapoor). Zardari and his non-Indian wife live a peaceful life, but the wife doesn't remember losing her baby girl in the fire that demolished the hospital Tanya was born in. Tanya helps her regain her memory about the incident and accept her daughter's death, thinking that all the while she might be their true daughter. Since that's not the case, heart-broken Tanya returns to India to her foster parents.
She then embarks on one last mission to find her father; this time it's Tony Castello (played by Dharmendra), a mafia leader. Initially doubtful of her, Tony meets up with his ex-flame, Susan (Hema Malini), who is now a nun. Eventually, after a gang fight, Tony accepts Tanya as his daughter and the movie ends with Tanya and her best friend (Arjan Bajwa) marrying in a church, with all four of Tanya's fathers walking her up the aisle.
Tanya's dad's name starts with an A: her "fathers" were named Abhay, Altaf and Anthony (full form for Tony). Also, the day Tanya was born, there was a huge fire and the records get misplaced and that's where the confusion starts. A kind colonel takes pity on baby Tanya and takes her home since he and his wife have no children of their own.[4][5]
