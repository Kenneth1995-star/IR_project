Red Scarf

In 1952, during the Korean War, many South Korean fighter pilots were killed. Of those that remain is one of the bravest and best, Major Na Gwan-jung. In the air he is cool and level headed, and directly and swiftly dispatches the enemy with a minimum of complication. On the ground he spends his time drinking with his comrades, the vagaries of life and death in wartime has led to the pilots adopting a live for the moment approach to life.
Ji-seon is the wife of a fallen pilot, widowed very soon after becoming married, unable to support herself the only option left to her is to become a bargirl. Na Gwan-jung saves her from this fate, helps provide for her, and falls in love with her. However, as she is the widow of a close comrade Gwan-jung cannot bring himself to act on his love; instead he acts as matchmaker introducing her to Bae Dae-bong, a cocky hotshot pilot, newly transferred to his unit.
Na Gwan-jung's unit is tasked with the destruction of a vitally strategic bridge, during which Bae Dae-bong's plane is shot down. Not wanting Ji-seon to lose another loved one, Gwan-jung risks all to keep the downed pilot safe until he can be recovered. The South Korean pilots are victorious and complete their mission, however with thoughts other than taking down the enemy fighter pilots spoiling his focus, Na Gwan-jung is unable to fly and fight in his usual cool, detached and dispassionate way and is killed in action.
The unit returns to base and Na Gwan-jung's will is read out, and in accordance with it his effects, including the red scarf which all the pilots wear, are divided amongst his comrades. Na Gwan-jung's mother arrives to visit her son with a delivery of beer, only to find that he has died in action. In keeping with her son's character she shares out the beers she brought for him amongst his comrades. Ji-seon soon too arrives and on learning of Gwan-jung's death, clutches his red scarf and cries inconsolably.
