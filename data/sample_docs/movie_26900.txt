Ankur Arora Murder Case

Dr. Romesh (Arjun Mathur) was a young medical intern who dared to dream. He was in awe of Dr. Asthana (Kay Kay Menon), the Chief Surgeon of the Shekhawat General Hospital. All he wanted was to be like him. He lived in with Dr. Riya Srivastav (Vishakha Singh), his co-intern and the love of his life.
However, when an eight-year-old boy, Ankur Arora dies due to Dr. Asthana's medical negligence, Romesh realises that a good surgeon is not necessarily a good person.
Together with Ankur's mother Nandita Arora (Tisca Chopra), and lawyer Kajori Sen (Paoli Dam), Dr. Romesh sets out on a turbulent journey to fight for what is right. A fight for justice against his mentor, the hospital and the love of his life who was initially against him for the fear of ruining her career and future. All the necessary evidences against Dr. Asthana were destroyed or literally snatched.The witnesses like Dr. Riya, who was the witness of the operation on the day of the operation, and the nurse Rosina who had informed Dr.Asthana about Ankur's eating food before the operation, also lied in the court. But later, Riya shoots the confession outburst by Dr.Asthana in her mobile, thus leading to the arrest of Dr.Asthana. Truth won no matter how influential the culprits were and how weak the evidences were.
