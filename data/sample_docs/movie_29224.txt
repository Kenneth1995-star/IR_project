Naan Kanda Sorgam

Meenakshi (Sowcar Janaki) is the daughter of a miserly millionaire. While she is drawn to public service, her father despises the idea. Meenakshi falls in love with Sundar (K. A. Thangavelu), who stages plays and donates earnings to impoverished people. Meenakshi's father despises him but, unknown to him, his daughter assists Sundar in his social welfare activities. When Meenakshi's father realises this, he forbids Meenakshi to leave the house and even appoints two men to guard her. Sundar disguises himself as a woman and fools the millionaire into appointing him as Meenakshi's tutor. When the millionaire arranges Meenakshi's marriage with a rich but older man, Sundar saves her by helping her escape. The father finds his daughter and locks her up, beating Sundar to an inch of his life. The rest of the film deals with how Yama, Vishnu and other gods help Meenakshi and Sundar unite.
